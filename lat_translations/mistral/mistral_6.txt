Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I completed this book for you, my Sons, which is the last on the science of medicine with its complement, and having reached an end in it through expositions of its contents and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you also with this Treatise, which is a part of operations, that is, surgery with hands.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since the operation with hands is prostrate in our region and at our time, altogether lacking; until perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace has disappeared, except for some small descriptions in ancient books which have been altered by hand, and error and hesitation have occurred, until the intentions have been closed off, and the force of it has been weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way from the positions, the declarations, and the abbreviations, and that I should come with forms of iron tools, and the rest of the instruments of work, through addition of declarations and proper use of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a skilled artist with his hand is not found in this present time, is because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy as Galen narrated, until he knows the remedies of members, their shapes, and their connections, and disconnections, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number, their exits, veins pulsating and quiet, and places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already said about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Whoever is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, may already fall into error, in which people are killed: as I have seen many of those who are formed by this science and boast about it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I have seen a foolish physician cut an abscess on a woman's neck, and he accidentally cut some arteries in the neck: therefore, blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another physician who presumed to draw out a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore, he came to him, and drew it out with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Wherefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I was already called to draw it out; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I have seen another physician who received a stick at the court of some Duke of our land for his medicine: and there was a black eunuch with him, who sustained a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician, with his ignorance, pressed the fracture over an open wound with awls, iron staples, and strong ties, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he cured him according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Then he dismissed him for some days and commanded him not to loosen the bandage; and he stood thus until an abscess formed on his leg, and his foot, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was therefore called to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and peace came, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, corruption had already become fixed in the limb; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Translation: Place therefore let corruption walk through the member until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous apostema: and it was healed afterwards until the evilness of its magnitude with its lord was revealed.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when it is a pure cancer from the humor of melancholy, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron entirely, unless it is in a member that can endure, so as to remove all of its extent.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And on account of this it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation which brings salvation: and an operation with which there is danger in various dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already awakened in all places of this book where the operation comes, where there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of this and divide it so that fools do not find a way to speak and shameful things.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore take the measurement with care and protection, and treat your sick ones gently and firmly, and make use of a better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and leave behind terrible illnesses difficult to heal: and remove from you what makes you fear, so that hesitation enters upon you in faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your profits.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen has already said in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat an evil sickness, lest you be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now however I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, set out, arranged from head to foot, and forms of instruments, and ironwork of the cautery, and all that is necessary for the operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On cutting and perforating, on venesection and cupping, and on wounds; and on the extraction of arrows, and similar matters; and an entire chapter arranged according to the forms of instruments. (paragraph break)
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration and dislocation, on the treatment of twisting and similar matters; arranged from head to foot, and according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.

Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the benefits and harm of cautery; in what constitutions it is appropriate, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold. (paragraph break)
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the quality of his remedies and his harmful effects; and in what composition they are presented.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of the remedy of the Cautery, and its harmful effects, is a long, subtle, scientific, and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also there was a multitude of wise men who disagreed about it; and to me, at least, their many discourses are enough for me, fearing a prolonged debate.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore, that the Cautery applies universally to every composition, which is with matter and without matter; except for two compositions, which are a hot composition without matter, and a dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In the hot and dry composition with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some indeed said that the Cautery is beneficial in this [hot and dry composition with matter].
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of this [that the Cautery is beneficial in hot and dry composition with matter], namely that the Cautery is not suitable for the sickness which is due to heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient to heal a hot and dry disease, when heated by hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite said that by Cautery is beneficial for any hot and dry sickness which happens in human bodies; because when you compare the body of a man and its humidity to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by his discourse; because he has often revealed that to me in experiment.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for him to come back to this, unless he who has already been tested and experienced in the last exercise of the chapter on Cautery, and knows the diversity of human compositions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and accidents thereof, and the space of time of those diseases.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining body compositions, there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For it has agreed all physicians on these: and they did not disagree in helping with cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, sons, that from the secret of cure by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with medicine burning, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member which is being cauterized: and it does not harm another joint connected with it, unless a small damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 However, the action of medicine burning reaches to what is extended from members: and perhaps it causes illness difficult to heal in a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Now we have understood that through an experiment, because of the length of service and study with art, and position on truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it was not forbidden to this book of mine, I would give you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels illnesses with a philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be understood by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time when cautery should be made, and put a better time for it with truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that cautery is suitable in every time: therefore, because damage occurring due to the time is drowned in help, which is attracted with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, pressing, which cannot endure delay: therefore because it is feared that what may happen from them is greater than a small damage which occurs due to the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that thought enter your minds, O sons, that it is only the common people and foolish physicians who believe that there is not always a return for the sickness cured by cautery; and they assume this as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think: because cautery is not, except in place of medicine, which alters complexion, and extracts humidities which are the causes, wherefore pain arises.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, cautery is superfluous over medicine due to the swiftness of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the power of its dominion: and it is possible that sickness returns at some hour according to the complexion of the sick, and the location of the sickness, and the virtue of the same: and what prepares in his body from an accumulation of superfluities within him: and what reaches him in acquiring it from foods, and similar things due to its causes, except for the sickness in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle sickness in a member with few superfluities and humidities, such as the cautery of a tooth, because of pain and similar things, it is possible that that pain does not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the common people is again correct that cautery is the last medicine: not to what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure that confers with medicine, nor with anything after the fall of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the matter is contrary to theirs and their intention, that cautery is the last medicine, is not, except when we administer modes of cure for a sickness and they do not confer with the same medicine: then we administer cautery at the end of things, and it confers: thence it happens that cautery is the last medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron; and they did not say this, if not because of the equality of gold, and the loftiness of its substance; and they said, that it does not cause a place for pus at the site of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 That is not entirely true; because I have already proven it and found that it does not do this in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a cautery with it (gold) is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you put fire to the cautery from gold in fire, it is not shown to you, when it burns according to the quantity that you want, due to the redness of gold; and when it rushes towards it (the gold) coldness, and if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into this (mistake) due to it; and because of this, a cautery with iron is more quickly and closely made among us for the sake of the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have already arranged this Chapter (on cautery) in the Cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged it from head to foot, so that those who are seeking (information on cautery) may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here is the cauterization for the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: these two are the causes of soda (seizures), and the flowing multitude of fluids from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all illness that happens due to coldness, such as paralysis, sodae, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick person: first, that the head should be evacuated with a solution of medicine cleaning for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the sick person, their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit square between your hands so that he puts his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then put the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger comes, mark that place with an uncauterized spot.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then put it on the marked uncauterized spot, descending with your hand to tighten it gradually, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly withdraw your hand, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone or quantity of pus has been discharged from the skull, then remove your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, press your hand with the iron itself or with another tool, until you see the bones that I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, dissolve it in water and soak the cloth in it, and put it on that place; leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place on top of it a wet cloth in butter, and let it remain until the burn is consumed by the fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 It is said that the larger an open wound remains, the more pus it discharges; therefore, it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be burned up to the bone; and the cautery should be held until it has heated something of the bone's thickness.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then grind down what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Others say that when the cautery reaches the bone, it should make an impression on the bone for as long as the bone falls off, so that it becomes like the shape of a scorch mark; or they use an instrument that women put in place of the small alphabet: and they believe that vapors from the head will escape from this place; and let the open wound remain for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be, in my opinion, it is better for his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head is weakened by the solution of its own continuity; as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of a sick person is naturally weak: and the first species of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it for his health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 On the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it persists in a weak person, and they use hyson (a type of tea), hot baths, bloodletting, massages with oil, and fomentation.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And particularly if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, as we have mentioned, and none of the above helps him: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of a weak person is strong by nature and not frail, and it finds extreme cold: then cauterize it with another cautery, but sparingly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on all the horns of his head with another cautery, but be careful not to penetrate the skin, and remove only the quantity of bone that we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 Cauterize it with one cautery on the occiput of his head, in the place which is called "was": and it is a place where pus collects: and clean out your medicine in this place, but do not remove bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the weak person finds relief from that intense pain, and it is different from the pain of all other cauteries on the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I will say that this cautery is in its place: and it must be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the occiput more subtly with the cautery used for cauterizing the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a hemiplegia, both with burned medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occurs on part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is treated with cleaning medicines, and further treatment is administered as I have said in the divisions of diseases, but it does not work completely: then cauterization is used in this case according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with burning medicine is to take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut the painful spot at the time with a broad lancet until there is a place under the skin where a tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it (the tooth) into the same place under the skin until it is hidden; then press upon it with a suitable plaster and leave it for fifteen hours, then dissolve it and extract the garlic clove and let it be for two or three days; later, place it submerged in butter on the spot until pus forms; then treat the spot with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, as I wrote in the twelfth treatise on Medications that Burn.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 But cauterization is performed in this manner (with iron).
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The form of the hot cautery is as follows: a cylinder of iron about the size of a finger, covered with a sheath of leather, and on both
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called a claw-like cautery because its head resembles the shape of a nail, having something sharp on it and in the middle there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you rotate the iron slowly with speed; and the amount that is burned should be of the thickness of the skin, as the middle part of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that an artery below is not burned and there is no bleeding.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the hot iron in water with salt and place it on the spot for three days; then immerse the hot iron in butter; later, treat the spot with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania (half headache) with the tip of the second cautery (small knife-like instrument).
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Be careful not to cut an artery during this half-headache, not by the ancient method.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 On the method of cauterizing in the old half-headache.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat a half-headache as we have said in the treatment that follows, and what we have said in the division of diseases, and it does not help: and you see from the disease that it is not enough for us what we have said with the first cautery with medicine, or with the cautery with fire, then it is necessary to use a cold cautery, until it whitens after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about this much: and put your hand instead, and tighten it until you cut an artery, and reach as far as the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the lower jaw area that moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, thus causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And take care and be careful about the flow of blood from the artery that was cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For there is fear in its cutting, especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not careful or experienced: and they abandon the operation first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will come with a reminder about the management of the flow of blood that occurs from the cut artery according to its method and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the disease that this cautery is not enough for him, and you see a weak body tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head as we have said, treat a wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 Cauterization is indeed better in this way and more suitable.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of cauterizing ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When cold pain occurs in the ear and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment as we have said in the division, and the pain does not subside, then cautery by fire: and that is what is called a puncture, whose shape is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the puncture is made around the entire ear, as it is rotated: or around both sides if the pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And elongate [the cautery] from the ear's root slightly after marking the spots with encaustum (beeswax): and let the amount of cautery be ten punctures on every ear, approximately.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then heal the spots until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 In the manner of cauterizing in a strain (torture).
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 A strain that is treated with cauterization, is not anything other than those types which occur due to phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterizing species that occur due to exhaustion and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When treating this species of strain with hyssop, mouth washings, and gargles, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the weakened area with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second slightly lower than its own time (i.e., below the earlobe), and the third at the junction of the two lips (labia).
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weakened area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur unless in the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the shape of the cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery itself, along the tip of the upper part of the ear near the head slightly, and another at the earlobe; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 Place your hand with the cautery until it is burned to a depth of half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 This is the form of Cautery, and it is made of a knife whose shape is as follows: however, it should not be too thin as you can see; it is necessary that the knife in it has little extra thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the places with it until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for apoplexy (ancient).
Caput VIII.	 Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy occurs and your treatment does not help, nor does the patient have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head as previously stated, and a cautery in the back of his head according to what has been described; the method of cauterization should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Additionally, it is cauterized with a Cautery on the mouth of the stomach; this is more the final procedure.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it will be treated with what has been described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for oblivion (forgetfulness).
Caput IX.	 Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in drink there are firstly large quantities of hyssop, and pills cleansing the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then scrape the head of the sick person entirely, and place upon his occiput ointment described in the treatise on ointments, and place it repeatedly.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cauterization: and do that according to the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is cured by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then do three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between every cauterization a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then take care of the cauterization, with that which preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however you wish an addition, and the sick person can bear it: then do a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 What if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then take care of him until he is cured: and let the cauterization be anointed according to the shape that was mentioned before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 [Chapter Title] On the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 You should proceed with the cleansing (munda) of the head with hyson (hyeeris), and with what was said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then scrape the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over behind it, and three over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If, however, you need for the softening (mollification) of the body to be done with more of these things, and the patient is weak and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until the skin of most of it has been burned off, and wipe your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of him (the patient), until he is cured: thus cauterize with oil (Oliuare).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 Epilepsy is not to be cauterized, unless that person's epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cleanse the brain of that person first with hyson (hyeris), and with the treatment we mentioned earlier: when the patient is very sick, or weak in accepting medicine.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If, however, the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medicine, then administer gargarisma, and cleansing mastication (masticationes) for the brain, before that for many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then scrape the head of that person, afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, as before (secundum quod praecessit in modo): and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that were mentioned in the presence of paralysis, and the softening (mollification) of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and back: and let the cautery be oiled (Cauterium oliuare) as before.

When the cause of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the Cauteries which we have mentioned in a person having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivities to melancholy and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him to drink what purifies his brain, according to what was mentioned in the division: then shave the head of the sick person, and make afterwards a well-made plaster made from linen, just like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it on the middle of the head: and the sick person sitting facing all directions should be held.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then bring a liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 It is better from ancient sheep butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over a controlled fire temperature that the finger can bear when it is inserted into it.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs I mentioned in division, then begin and wash the sick person, with it to clean his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moistness, and make him sit in a bath for several days while fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head, and brand himself in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then brand him with two cauteries on both temples, if there is an obstruction of water descending in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is an obstruction of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterizations be long in width equal to the temples: and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something from him, then cut it off immediately with any medicine that is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and caution against bleeding.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are old and constant: and they are on veins and arteries that are manifest on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is from superfluidities cold, phlegmatic: then brand with the same cautery as I mentioned in the obstruction of water descending, branding in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries on both temples, and with two cauteries on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if it is necessary to add, then brand him on all sides of the eye with caution, on the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it over both eyebrows with two cauteries in all places; and they extend from the two temples: and let the length of the entire cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not go beyond the end with your hand, rather according to the amount that is burned by the third eyelash.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 Method for Cauterizing the Eyelid when the hair turns inward and pricks the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Head Seventeenth.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 Cautery is in it according to two modes: either cautery with fire; or cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In cauterio with fire, command the patient to shave his hairs beforehand if he is among those who clean them, until they are extended and evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If however they prick him at its origin: then constrict his eyes with adhesive until they do not move until they grow (healing).
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they grow and are evened out, then place the head of the patient in your lap; afterwards mark on the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic (wax), mark what is second in shape to a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a cotton soaked in egg white or slippery elm gum on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, which has this shape (circular or spoon-shaped).
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize on the shape marked by you gradually at many spots, until the surface of the skin that is like a myrtle leaf, completely visible, is burned.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of your health work is: if you see that the eyelid of the eye already contracts, and hairs are rising at the prick on the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift your hand at that time; and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place on it a cotton with butter until the scab falls off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If some hair grows back after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If however the hairs are on the lower part (eyelash area): then cauterize it until they rise to their own place and become even so that they do not prick the eye again.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 Method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	 Head XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is to be ordered for the sick one, that he lets go of hairs until they grow out and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from linen cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and unabsorbed lime each a weight of ounce I or about that, then crush them together well with good grinding, and make it quickly so that it does not get cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread the paste on the cloth that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it over the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under the eye, an egg yolk immersed in white of egg; and let the head of the sick one be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your forefinger on the medicine and press it a little.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it as often as the sick one feels pain from the medicine; because its pressure is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While this pressure, which he feels as pain, continues, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the pain subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then consider if the eyelid rises as it does when contracted with fire or incision, this is good; and if not, then repeat the application of the medicine on the place where the medicine does not press or blacken until your operation becomes equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place over it the yolk of an egg with butter until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with a diaphine ointment or another one until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the operation that you keep the last guard so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after days and something fights from hairs within the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which becomes softened from the eyelid, as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it (the affected area) until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore according to that (knowledge), let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness for this art should not be hidden from you.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula (lacrimal duct), and your treatment does not help as mentioned in the divisions of diseases, then it is necessary that you cauterize it using this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head with one of your hands so that it is not moved or shaken along with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place the cotton soaked in alcohol or slime of comfrey on his eye, then with a hot cautery whose shape is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Be concave like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you want it to penetrate up to the other end, or if you want it to be extended upward, it should be thus shaped.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 Nevertheless, this concave shape is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then open the fistula if it is open and remove the pus from it, and cut it (the affected area): and if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the hot cautery on it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand a little away from the cautery near the eye, by the nose, so that your hand does not slip or shake, and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery until the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice if necessary; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place a cotton with butter, and care for it with an incisive ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 What if it passes beyond forty days and is not healed: then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone appears; and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another way of cautery for a fistula, which some of the first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and pierce it; then put in it a fine cannula, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a quantity of drachmas made from melted lead, and hold your hand with good retention on the cannula, and do not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary that you put a hot cotton on the eye of the weak person, either in egg white or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed with what we said from cautery and cure, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostril hole, and lead the fistula to the nasal passage, according to what comes in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Multiple splits occur in the Lip, which are called Hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you treat these splits, as we have said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then apply small cautery with a knife, according to this shape.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its depression be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it [the heated tool] quickly into these splits, until the cautery reaches the depth of the splits.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with pitch, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 [Title] The method of cauterization in the Fistula of the Mouth.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes old, and pus runs, and a fistula is formed: then treat this fistula, and the treatment does not help in it, then it is necessary that you apply heat to the cautery according to its size, which can enter into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the heated tool into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand; until the iron becomes hot to its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then treat it after that, as we have said about treatment, until it is treated.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus is cut off and healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to remove the corrupted bone according to what comes out of its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 [Title] The method of cauterization on softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gum softens due to moistures and teeth move, and care of it with medicines does not help: then place the head of the sick in your bosom.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then apply fire to the cautery, whose form will come later, in such a way that you place the Cannula on the tooth and introduce into it the heated cautery quickly: hold your hand for a moment, until the sick person feels the warmth of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 Then remove your hand: then repeat the cautery several times as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the sick person fill his mouth with water and salt, and hold it for an hour: then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For the tooth moved hardens, and softened gums contract, and dryness sets in to corrupt moisture.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the tooth pain is due to coldness or has coldness itself, or worms, and care with medicines does not help: then apply cautery in it according to two modes: either cautery with butter; or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery with butter is such that you receive fresh butter, and heat it in an iron cauldron or in a ewer.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take the bag and turn it over the end of the wound.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Submerge it into boiling butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools; then repeat this process several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 If desired, immerse wool or cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place a heated iron on it until the heat reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 Cauterization with fire is to prepare a copper or iron tube (cannula).
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 Let there be something bulky in the body so that the sharp heat does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply fire to the cautery whose form will come; place it on the tooth and hold your hand until it cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this several times, as pain will subside either on the same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 It is necessary to fill the weakened bone with good butter and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whatever shape you desire, provided it is possible; and this is the form of the cannula (tube).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 Chapter on how to cauterize ulcers.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When worms are from phlegm, and from cold moistness, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and desire digestion quickly: then to a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open extremities, so that the smoke may leave at the other end of the cautery: and place it heated above the ulcer once, and a second time, if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then let it be for three days, and place on it a cup full of butter heated, until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the canal heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 On the mode of cauterizing in swelling of voice, and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moisture accumulates on the bronchial tube of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by cold constitution, then it is necessary that the ill person first be evacuated with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it at the nose at the root of the throat in a hollow place: and be careful not to reach with the cautery at the throat, nor on the skin, unless something of that part is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck near the last vertebra of that joint: and let the cautery be small according to the manner which was mentioned earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what has been mentioned before, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 On the mode of cauterizing in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When cough and lung disease are from cold moistness, and the ill person does not have fever, nor phthisis, and the illness is neither old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle in hollow, loose, open places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be a cannula as described before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if you wish your cauterization to be by pricking with the cautery called "Punctum", whose shape was described before in the section on ear pain: let them be pricks of about thirty, up to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with that same thing as before, until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the cautery have three branches: in this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Why should cauterization be applied with it, when you perform it with one of the three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for a tickle (Ticklish condition), in the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is dislocated due to the cause of humidity, and it does not return to its place within an hour after its dislocation, until that has become its custom for returning, then it should be dislocated again from a slight movement, as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient lies down on his back or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then clean the skin that is inside the tickle towards the upper part with your left hand fingers: and if it is a union that is dislocated towards the inner parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take the cautery with two openings (cannulae).
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and the figure of cauterization with four cauteries will come.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes a cauterization occurs with a cautery having three prongs, whereupon the figure of cauterization becomes six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the tendon.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes one more is added to it, whereupon there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place over the cautery narrow strips of salted meat.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the patient remain still to avoid movement of the limb until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if a dislocation is upwards (rarely does this happen), then cauterize the same over the shoulder with an ironsmith's cautery or many puncturing cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For joints are strengthened and moisture is removed; and the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When coldness and many humidities occur in the stomach until it is expelled from its composition and multiplied catarrhs are produced to it, and continuous methods of treatment fail, then the sick person must lie on his back, extend his legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries, an iron smith's cautery of the size of one finger at the sternum, and two cauteries below from the sides of one cautery, until a triangle figure of cauteries comes.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch them apart so they do not join when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery should be the size of two finger-widths of skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And let the figure of the cauteries be in this shape without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape, then let the cautery that is used for this cauterization be one in the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 The stomach is to be cauterized by piercing it with a probe that frightens the patient from the cautery: and it is, as signs are placed on the stomach according to the quantity desired with wax: then cauterize it with the same cautery at the point pierced: then take care of it with the healing method that preceded until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On the method of freezing the stomach.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain arises in the stomach from coldness and humidity, or from thick vomiting until it has passed through its natural expulsion of excess, and the sick person is not cured by what was said, then the sick person should lie on his back on his neck, and signs with wax three cauteries according to this shape, and the same quantity below in the stomach near the hypochondriac region where the elbow reaches: and let the space between each cautery be as wide as a finger's thickness: and let the cautery be as long as the straight body: and do not press your hand too much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity that is to be burned be taken from the thickness of the skin, but not increased in half: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already stretched out his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a surgical cautery, when subtlety and wisdom are present with you in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And be careful not to advance too far in cauterization so that the entire thickness of the skin is burned, for the body is being burned entirely and it reaches the intestines; because the skin there is delicate, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 On the method of cauterizing abscesses in the stomach.
Caput XXX.	 Head, Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When there is an abscess that needs to be opened, and you want to know if it is in the liver flesh or its sheath: then, if it is in the liver flesh, a weak pain and heaviness without sharpness will occur; and if it is in the liver sheath, with pain it will have a very intense sharpness; and you notice that the treatment of this abscess has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the weak person should lean his head back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then shape the location of the abscess with the hot iron; then heat the cautery similar to a scalpel.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with the heated cautery until the entire skin is burnt and reaches the abscess cavity, until all pus is discharged; then treat the patient with the treatment of opening abscesses, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And this cautery shape should not be used, unless the person's interest in the art of medicine is prolonged; and through whose hands these diseases often occur with experience; then he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better for her to leave herself, in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Head, Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be applied to cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And you should take a dry root of Aristolochia with long roots; select the longest root from it, which is about the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil and heat it over fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize it with one heated cautery in the area between the connection of the collarbone and neck, and with two small cauteries below slightly sloping cheeks on that side.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also in it, which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping towards the back a little bit: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from the back: one in what is between the two scapulas: and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, the lower one being the one that is between the two scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be in the open air smelling the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some ancient ones have said that there are men who use a cautery similar to a rod of iron, they heat it and put it inside what is between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and the pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of Epates.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear, that either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the place, which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we said in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then there is cauterization in it according to three modes, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is that you make three or four cauteries in a row along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauterizations of Epates, whose figure was previously mentioned.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And let the mode of cauterization be equal to the one we mentioned in the cauterization of Epates.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the sick person lie face down on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method for cauterization is: hold a pair of cauteries, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is straight over the spleen, where the weak arm arrives; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then introduce two hot irons very deeply, until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then extract one of the cauteries; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you want to cauterize with a cautery having three hot irons.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you have released it to emit pus for many days; indeed, this is more effective than the rest which preceded from treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall in hydropsy, unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a hydropsy patient with the methods of treatment mentioned in division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two behind the loins, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery to emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the weakened patient from treatment after cauterization with it; because two intentions must be assembled for him, and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be clavicle-shaped; as its previous shape has been; and the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive oil-shaped, as its previous shape has been.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Cum autem pedes, aut crura aegros, aut fract
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When the feet or legs are sickly or fractured and filled with yellow water (i.e., pus): it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot, which is between the big toe and ankle; and take the cautery in hand without twisting it; then take the hand away; and do not reapply it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The yellow water will run out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the point of a knife-like cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other lower about halfway down the leg; and over the hip make two cauteries: and leave the open cautery for a long time without treatment until some water comes out from it; then treat it as we have said before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 On the method of cauterizing for abdominal dissolution.
Caput XXXV.	 Cum enim ventrem aliquis malignus, aut
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the abdomen is malicious or: when there is a dissolution of the abdomen due to cold and moistness, until its powers of retention and digestion are weakened in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of treatment, but does not heal; and you see an infirm person tolerating a cautery with excessive power, then cauterize it with a large cautery over its own stomach, according to the method used in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the umbilicus, with a small sharp cautery; and a large cautery or two large cauteries on the alcatin above the navel.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture and the infirm person tolerating it, then cauterize it with a cautery over the breastbone and over the whole ilium; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The progressing treatment, whose advantage does not wander.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they consist of thick, cold, or corrupted fluids, and they cannot be cured by what has been said in the division; then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back slightly triangularly below the almeidatum, and with a cautery near the navel as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you consider that its stomach is chilled and food is not digested, and you see the face turning pale; then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as described before; also cauterize the liver and spleen of his with another cautery, along with a cautery on the kidney; and leave the open cautery for some time; then care for him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut (open) althelul, then heat the cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the heated (cautery) into the cut althelul: and hold your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many altheluls (abscesses), then cauterize each one with the cautery as I have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them (altheluls) with what you apply to them from ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it (the althelul) with a large cautery on the coal, it is more useful for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII. (the thirty-eighth chapter)
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 If the patient does not obey the incision and operation as I have described at the place, and is afraid of it, he may heal with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When a fistula occurs and becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and the affected area is corrupted (putrid).
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, as is necessary, you should examine it with a probe of fine material.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize the depth of it (the fistula) by probing with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery that is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert the heated (cautery) into the fistula and close the wound with a nail at the depth to which it was inserted.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery over her (the fistula) until all the rotten flesh is burned away; do this once, twice, or three times according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or large vein if it is there; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or the intestine, then be careful about all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And thou shalt not do that, except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and consider, for it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If the place is sealed and the matter is cut away from it, and it remains for a long time: then you shall know that it is healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if the matter is not cut away from it, then you shall know that it is penetrating, or that the bone inside of it is corrupted, or as one of those (conditions) whose memory will come up in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or gross wind and it diminishes due to weakness of the body, then it is necessary that you cauterize it on the upper part over the kidneys with a cautery on top of each kidney with a claw-shaped cautery, whose memory is mentioned earlier.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we have cauterized it for the second time in the same almethenum (location).
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore they will be more towards the benefit.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and moistness, and the sick person is unable to retain urine, then cauterize it below in the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and with one cautery from the right scrotum, and another from the left; and let the length of this cauterization on the side be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries, if necessary; and let it be according to the preceding cauterization with a nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 When the bladder becomes weakened and softened due to cold and moisture, causing the sick person to be unable to retain urine, then
Caput XLI.	 Cauterize it below in the lower part of the scrot
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When the bladder is afflicted by cold and moisture and is unable to be impregnated, the menstrua are corrupted and their provocation is delayed, causing pain during their arrival, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a lower back cautery or two: let it be with a nail-shaped cauterium.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 If the anus is displaced in a dislocation, then cauterize it on both sides of the anus, equally from the left and right side, using one cautery for
Caput XLII.	 the anus, with equal care from the left and right side, using one
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 If the moist mucous effuses to the vagina and cause its exit from its place, and a sign of this is that one leg prolongs over the other when they are compared together; and a hollow spot is found in it where the dislocation occurs: then cauterize it equally on both sides of the anus using one cautery each.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it should be cauterized over the vagina of the sick person using a similar circular cautery: After you mark the circumference of the vagina with the encaustrum, as described; and let the vagina fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the shape that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large oily one; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and its cause is coldness and moistness: and the sick person is treated as we said in the division, but the treatment does not help, and it worsens: then it is necessary that you release the sick person from thick fluids with foul pills or artificial pills, or similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is done according to two methods: either cauterization with medicines advancing, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterization with fire, is according to many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of these is, to cauterize over the ankle joint itself with three triangular cauteries in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space be between every cautery of thickness of a finger's length: and let the cautery be to oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Occasionally, however, cauterization is made in the middle over the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes the ankle joint dislocation, one: so that it contains the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn the thickness of the skin all around.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the ankle itself, and it does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place where the sick person indicates, where there is pain, and your cautery four fingers on the side of the forest part: and let the cautery be a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a cautery of points, three, or four, or more if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that the pain is turned towards the leg from the foot, then cauterize it there with a single-pointed cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful with every cauterization in your work, so as not to burn the nerve or a large artery, and thus attract harm upon the sick person or constriction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the hock, and burned too much in cauterization, and the leg swelled so that the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all over, and the entire foot rotted; then there followed rupture of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said that in cauterizing the ankle, this method of cautery should be used.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a small iron rod similar to the thumbnail in size and thickness; and within its opening, there should be a third of that small iron.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And the space between each small iron should be as much as the knuckle of the thumb; and let the small irons have openings on both sides; and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make handles of iron well-suited for the small irons.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it (the small iron) is heated in fire until it turns red and emits sparks; then it should be placed on the box of the ankle on the sick person lying down on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize him with three round irons at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let him go for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards pack it with butter: and let the open wound heal for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Albucasis says, in this manner of cautery, we have not been often employed, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, few are found who wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who endures it, and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with stimulating drugs is, that you should make two pieces of silk having a perforated thread, into which descends the key of his gate from brass or iron, the length of the wall: whose knots in their height are two, or as if they were themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be the space which is between both of equal thickness to a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let it hold together on either side, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it upon a box of an oar, a weak one lying upon the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand much upon the box of the oar.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between the two circles from warm water, which is heated slightly with fire and hold it for an hour's time: and let the weak one endure its biting and burning, for he himself finds the biting as if by fire, until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wash your hand with the instrument and clean the oar with warm water together with sweet water: then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter upon it until the blackness of the burning is removed: and let it go for some days, and let pus run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 The remedy is at last in help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a setting in it that contains water, as you did with the ankle, equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take equal parts of lime and unburnt chalk; grind each one separately, and put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that will be added to it; place another earthenware pot underneath; pour on top of the lime and chalk from sweet water, so that they are submerged by a finger's depth; when you have compressed them with your hand, let it stand until the water descends in the lower part of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather that water altogether and pour it over another lime; cook until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For indeed, it will then be very strong for sharpness, which is used in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other body parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the action of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medications are those with which anchors and also stitchwort, walnut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed. [The rest of the sentence is missing.]
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen indeed reported the cure of a certain man from ancient times, who was cured of pain in the anchor and sciatic vein; he praised it very much.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not need any other cure, and because he was cured from the first application, until he reported that perhaps he himself had entered a bath carried there, and came out already healthy from it.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from green seedage; and if no green seedage is found, dry ones should be gathered, recently; they must be ground thoroughly with some fat, and placed on the anchor where there is pain, or leg, or hip: and tied, and left for three hours' quantity, or until the patient feels relaxation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then insert him into a bath (or tub).
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes hot, insert him (the instrument) into the bed (of fire or coals).
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 Pain retreats and it heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides says that goat dung, when cauterized with it on the sciatic vein, brings this about: and it becomes a cautery in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on a deep place that is between the toe of the foot and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung and heat it in fire until it becomes coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the wool and let it rest until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Repeat this again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until sensation reaches the ankle through the intermediary and pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called the cautery of goat dung.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Section on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes pain occurs in the back from various causes, either from falling, striking, excessive evacuation, and similar ones, or from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery does not fall except in this single case, which is made by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the sick with fetid pills, and similar ones, they should be made over the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the almud itself, after signs have been made with wax in every line, five or more cauteries according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the sick person: and let the cauterization be done with a cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, together with the middle claw-shaped cautery, according to this shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the swelling of the Hump (Gibbositas).
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 Often this illness occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its beginning in children is that it happens on him constriction in panting during lifting and movement: and you find at the end of the vertebrae of the back and nodes of it, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery shaped like this.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And let the cautery encompass all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it is healed as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware not to administer cautery on a hump that occurs due to muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterization in gout, and the pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	 De modo cauterizandi in podagra, et doloribus
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of the joints are caused by cold and moist humors spreading to any part of the body, and when the pain is in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call this gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Since, therefore, when gout caused by cold is treated with means of treatment and the pain does not subside, then a cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is to be cauterized with him after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be Olivar.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to prick the sole of the foot, then do so with a cautery for pricking.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints and this often occurs, then cauterize it over the entire knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using the same cautery as Clavius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pain ascends to the knees and back: then administer what was said concerning cautery in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pain is only in the hands: then prick around the nails as two lines are rolled.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If some of the pain remains in the fingers: then prick them all over each nodule and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pain ascends after several days to the elbows or shoulders: then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a weak person from good diet and medicine intake.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If good care is taken and phlegm is evacuated, healing will be aided by the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 On the method of cauterization for ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When there is a rupture in the groins and the intestine or scrotum descends, and it begins close by: then it is necessary that you advise the sick person to abstain from food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 He should use purgatives, so that he may pass stool from his bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then he should lie down on his back before you, and you should command him to hold his breath until the scrotum or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then you should reduce him with your fingers and make a mark with hot wax at the rupture on his chest, with a sign whose end is similar to half of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply cautery with this shape until it becomes white and expels pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine or scrotum into its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then the assistant shall place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and you have placed a pulley under him, and one servant above his thighs, and another above his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on the mark, with your hand holding it straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you follow the bone with it; or replace him with another if you do not reach the bone with it the first time until the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cautery operation, lest you burn him, and a great evil or death come upon the sick person through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not follow the bone with the cautery, the operation does not help.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 It is necessary that the cautery be small for children, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	The patient lies down on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary that you place food for him in accordance with the duration of his cure, to soften his stomach, so that the intestine does not come out during surgery or evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wants to perform surgery after forty days, then administer a well-made ligature and hold it for forty other days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 Let him be reduced by work, let him be filled with food and drink, and let him be silent with strong voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when using this regimen, he will heal with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and they are starting and want to be added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautionery in accordance with its size: and let that which is burned from then on be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then take care of him, as I said before: do not add anything.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some have said in the beginning: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautionery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with a hot iron and a line is placed which is across the width at the top of the rupture, and another line down below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the cautery tongs.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cauterization is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in pain due to rupture or injury.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When there is pain in some parts due to rupture or injury and the pain persists for a long time and does not cure with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a puncture cautionery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be for each member according to its size and its own smallness and weakness, and also according to its strength, and its location of twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is cured by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the cautery upon him.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is a custom for these pains that they are changed from one member to another which is closer to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, you must pursue them with the cautery until the sick man is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the manner of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Lepers are sometimes helped by a great extent by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the species of Leprosy which arises due to corruption of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you wish to cauterize it, consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not abate nor stabilize: then fear for the sick person, lest corruption spread over his entire body; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second lower toward the forehead near the end of the hairs, and two over the two horns, and one behind over the nuchal bone.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And the last [cautery] press your hand slightly with the cautery until it makes an impression smaller than a finger, and the scales will be dislocated from it; so that the expiration of gross vapors from it is relieved, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If leprosy is already spread over the sick person and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the cheeks, and two cauteries on the shoulders, and six on the spondyles of the back, and one large one over the alhahosos near the greater trochanter and one above it in the same almeidat: and two over the ankles: that is, over every ankle with one, and two over the knees, and two over the elbows, and two over the wrists, and two over the tendons of his breast; and cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize over all the calcanei of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Beware not to burn the nerves that are above the last calcaneus (heel bone).
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 Whenever cauterized with a cautery on the chin, and another on the breast, and another on the epigastrium (upper abdomen).
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that as much more you add cautery, it is more beneficial and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick do not feel pain in cautery as healthy ones do, for this reason, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 Cauteries should be of different sizes and shapes according to the limbs and joints; this depends on the type of instruments that preceded.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then, treat the cautery with flour from a plant mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Section on Cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Caput L.	 Chapter L. (52)
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb is numbed and treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and yet it does not heal, then the affected limb should be cauterized with cauteries, according to the size of the limb or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery go in slightly deeper than the skin's thickness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Whenever a cautery is applied for numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, at the joints of the back near the nerve exits that move that limb, the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to apply it unless you are wise about the anatomy of limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.

Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaraz becomes gangrenous and no medicine is applied to it: then cauterize over the affected area with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white disappears and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with a mixture of barley flour and lentils with rose oil, arnoglossa leaves, dove blood, and heron blood. Each ingredient should be an equal part. Mix all these together, soak the cloth in the mixture, and apply it to the affected area until it heals.

Caput LII.	 Chapter LXII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When a cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it rotates.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise have said that it should be cauterized with the ultimate cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 That does not seem good to me, for I fear it will burn: and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is more correct to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we said before: or with many cauteries.

Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has adubelation and it slows in maturation, either due to excessive matter causing it or because the person is old and weak with few blood vessels, or because of time and a desire to hasten the maturation of adubelation: then cauterize around its circumference with many small puncturing cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten when it matures.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to make a perforation with the cautery: then heat the cautery in fire, and this is its form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the adubelation until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be weak after that, to alleviate the course of the purgatives.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in a rotten wound.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is not unless it is walking corruption in a limb, and it consumes itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a corrosion in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then apply much cautery, small and large nails according to what suits the place where the corrosion is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the entire corrosion, and no part of it remains deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it rest for three days and put over the cauterized places finely ground sulfur with oil until all scabs are removed and the entire corrosion is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If after three days you see new flesh growing healthy, without any corrosion, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then apply cautery again to the remaining parts of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 Corrosion is sometimes treated with an acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 It arises where cautery was applied.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 Nevertheless, cautery with fire is quicker in help. And I have already said that the cauterization of it with an acute medicine is useful in division; take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on how to cauterize nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 It often happens that this sickness occurs in the lower parts of the feet and it is a serious condition, filled with pus, which damages the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 Cauterization is done in these cases in two ways: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the cauterization with fire, it is done by heating a concave cautery similar to a vulture's feather, made of iron according to the size needed to hold the nail from all sides; and the edges should be thin.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the hot iron on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then plaster it with malves from the forest, crushed with salt; and leave the plaster on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted by its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with a gentle ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and occur frequently on the surface of the body, particularly in hands and feet; then administer cauterization with hot water: and it is that you receive a cannula from brass, iron, or from an eagle's feather; and place it on the nail, or the sore.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula: hold your hand and turn it with a slight compression to print the edge of the cannula on the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way deep to the root of the nail; and let the weak person wait a little while for the biting of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then leave it, for the nail will be uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to each one separately, until you come upon all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been uprooted, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 \*\*On the Method of Cauterization in Tremor.\*\*
Caput LVI.	 Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs in a person due to cold in the nerve, or quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal spine, and between every spine with a cautery, and in its chest with a cautery, and over its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For trembling quiets with the cauterization of oil, and hastens the health of the cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 § On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	 Head LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 At times, foul matters called Albathir (boils) are expelled from the body; these boils arise from corrupted thick substances.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize the entire head of each boil with a fine cautery and myrtle wood, whose tip has been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or, if with a long root of Aristolochia (Snakeweed).
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a concave cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes, the cauterization of ademeanol (a type of abscess) is done at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; they do not increase and the excess is broken causing them to discharge pus, from which they heal.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization during blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII (Roman numeral).
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 It often happens that blood flows from an artery, which has been cut near a wound, due to external causes or during the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar cases; it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to someone, then quickly place your hand at the opening of the artery and put your index finger on it; press it tightly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing can be expelled from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small olive oil-coated cautery in the fire and many more of them; blow on it until they are lit very well.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has been torn; place the cautery over the vein and then remove your finger quickly; hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled with the finger from the opening of an artery, and the cautery is extinguished, then take another cautery hastily, from those that are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not cease to do that (the procedure) one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befalls the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it (the artery); especially because the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it (the artery) is drawn out, the ends are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines of the property for cutting off blood are placed upon it (the artery), and it is squeezed with a proper ligature.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the cutting off (of the artery) with a ligature and compression with a cloth, or placing of burning things and similar items, does not completely restore him (the patient), unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If that (the procedure) should happen to anyone and the physician is not present nor medicine: then let him begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have said, and with very strong compression, until the blood is obstructed from the superior part of the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And let the finger not be removed from above it (the artery) with cold water of violent coldness always, until the blood is frozen, thickened and cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile let him consider in it (the wound) what requires a cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Such Like Things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 As we have said in the first chapter, every illness where cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I set there chapters from the neck down to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that what is sought may be clarified for those who seek it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that (discussion), you sons must know what is in this chapter from the fear which was mentioned in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for this reason it is necessary that there be a greater caution in this, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often falls with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess, or the opening of a wound, or treatment of wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incision on a stone, and such like: from all of which is associated tremor, fear, and death occurs in many cases.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you that it does not happen to you what is hesitant, for sometimes men of this art fall into your hands like weak ones.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who gets angry with his illness, and death is easy for him because of the intensity he finds from weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when it comes from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there is one who gives his guaranty and pays you along with it, hoping for health, but his illness is fatal.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate that you agree with him who comes to you from those whose method is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be more intense than your greed and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from it unless after certain knowledge which verifies at your place the successful outcome.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And in treating all your sick people, make prognosis and indication concerning that which is appropriately healthy.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For there is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, as well as memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not remove from you guidance and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet: so that you may be relieved of what is sought from it and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on Treating Water That Gathers in Children's Heads.
Caput I.	 Section I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness frequently occurs in children during childbirth: or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And it sometimes happens due to an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed, I have not seen this illness in others than children; and death approached every one of them whom I saw from them; therefore it seemed to me that the operation should be avoided in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed, I have seen a child whose head was full of water and his head grew great every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and bone; or it collects under the bone above the brow ridge.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on it, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a fissure in the middle of the head, one opening wide; and let the length of the fissure be like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of trephining (spatumilis).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place two fissures, according to this form (trephining).
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is under the bone, and there is a sign of it, which you see that the joints of the head are open everywhere; and water sinks when you press it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you; then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tighten the fissures with bandages and lints.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then pour oil and wine over it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then cut the ligament, and care for the wound with sutures and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not let the head be bound equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick man with dry food of little moisture until the limb recovers and heals.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears, and collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes it is more in the skull, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore, with the incision, go where you see the abscess and filled water: and cut it as much as possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a blood flow, and let the sick man die from this flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 [Section heading] On incisions of arteries after the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone suffers from catarrhs on the eyes or chest and it becomes chronic and does not improve with medical treatment: then the final cure is more in him, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wishes to make an incision there (on the affected area), let him shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let him tighten his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then observe where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And these places are places that are depressed behind the ears: and they are rarely hidden except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both with pitch (or wax): and make an incision on both sides with a spatula or sharp tool, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be done along the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if one wishes, introduce the spatula under the artery, and make an incision upward with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 Let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when an artery is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which leaps to the interior with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If, however, the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that measurements from the ear determine the size of three fingers' space.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark both with pitch (or wax) and make an incision up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what must be released from the blood is about 6 ounces, and you may possibly release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 All of this according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the disease and the filling of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then observe at the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there remains any of the flesh at the bone, then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur: then tighten the wound with linen rags.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemiplegia or acute catarrh due to acidic humoral excess and heat in the neck muscles, or an old sclerosis, violent, and similar conditions occur in a man, and it is treated with methods of medication, but there is no improvement: then we have experience in dealing with such diseases by extracting arteries from the neck or cauterizing them, as we have said.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 The method of operation for extracting them (arteries) is as follows: shave the sick hairs that are on the neck, and stretch to the visible artery in the neck.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indeed evident to you by its pulse and rarely hidden except in a few men or in case of violent coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then let the sick person tighten his head with any cloth of his own and then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply heat to the place with warm water until it appears clearly to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the spatula that I have prepared earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it (the spatula) easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then plunge a hook into it (the artery) and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin, and make it escape from all sides from the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is fine: then insert the tip of the hook into it.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off that portion according to its length where the ends are extended and contracted so as not to cause bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut and not separated, blood does not rise deep inside.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate the blood to six ounces up to three-quarters.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: it must be tied in two places with strong double thread, silk or catgut, or with a twisted linen strip, so that decay does not occur near it before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the excess, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a small cautery: until its ends are cut and it remains in place for that same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 It is better work unless if the patient has fever, or has a warm constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is from those things that help to end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better treatment.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of the artery, it is necessary that the place be filled with cooked clay from ancient times; and little balls made of clay should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the solution, it will be cleaned with dry medications that promote growth of flesh, and with linen cloths until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation bleeding occurs from the artery, then hasten to cut it with a cautery, or to fill the place with wax; and press your hand until the blood stops flowing.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If nothing from these is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And pack the place with water of intense cold, until the pain subsides and it is tied as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the vein is lighter and easier to remove, it is to be cauterized with this cautery having two small blades; and the sharpness of the two blades should resemble a lancet.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are sharp like two knives, cold is needed for both of them; and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since there is a certain thickness in them, heat from fire must be held within them and the flesh is cut quickly; therefore this work is better than any other, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with hot iron; and place both heated ones until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends can be removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They do not coagulate completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the care of sharp, frequent epiphora from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When the tears are frequent and the flow is from veins on the outside of the skull; and no medicine for their cure is applied to them with medicines; and you see the face of the sick already reddening, and he feels a wandering in his forehead like the wandering of ants; and his eyes are weakened, wet, so that the hairs of them have already been corroded by corrosion; and the eyelids have been heated by the acuity of the tears: then the ancients used this operation for their cure, and they named it treatment with the sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is to be ordered that the sick person should shave the hairs on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three cuts in the forehead, equal in length to the forehead; and let the length of the cut be about two fingers, and one cut should be in the middle of the forehead, and the second, a little below the movement of the arms, and the third on the opposite side: and avoid cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and extend your hand from the continuation of the lower jaws, and let the entire length of the cut be the size of three connected fingers: and prepare for yourself a piece of sponge or dry cloth with which to squeeze the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a double-ended probe (spatula) with sharp tips, which follows its shape immediately.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision that is on the side of the temple, until the second incision: and excise with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the sifak (sinus frontalis) that is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the central incision until the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then extract this probe and insert into the first incision another tool called a sharp scalpel, blunt on one side but not on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And position its sharp side towards the attached flesh with skin and its blunt side towards the bone; push it in until it reaches the midline, and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except where the incision continues until it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do this along the midline up to another fissure (incision).
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood has flowed out, squeeze the places from the clotted blood fragments.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then put a linen cloth soaked in old oil (or wine or vinegar) into every incision and cover them with small pieces of wool soaked in water, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And be careful not to cause a hot abscess (infection).
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 On the third day, loosen the bandage and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other ointments used to heal wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the treatment of acute tears (eye discharge) and catarrhs of the eyes from within the skull.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone experiences acute and intense catarrhs or tears that are persistent, you see their eyes weakened, small, and their appearance is already debilitated; and their eyelids are ulcerated, hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain deep within the skull, which causes sneezing; then take action on these symptoms when this happens, because those substances and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered that the sick person shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; let the incision go as far as the bone; and move your hand away from the temples which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; then dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the fissure between the two lips with a spatula or with flax from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it above with thread; and dip the threads in wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it, and see that the abscess is about to burst; then it is necessary to fracture the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then treat the person with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow; as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony; and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Chapter on the care of an ear wound.
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and wood; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is fluid, such as water, vinegar, and similar substances; or it is some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone or something like a stone falls into the ear, which does not grow in the ear, lay open the ear; if you see the stone, then pour some oil of roses or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction and make it cause sneezing with powder, and insert oil at the nostrils during sneezing; after you place in the ear's edge fragments from cloth or wool, and stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For many times, it goes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out, then administer the extraction with Geppi, that is, finely-powdered pigeon droppings; whose shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out with Geppi, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction with a finely-sharpened blind hook in small doses.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of bronze and insert the end of the cannula into the ear's hole as much as possible; and insert what is in the circumference of the cannula with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no path for wind but the cannula; then draw it out with your strong attraction of wind.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 For many times, it comes out by what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not come out by this method, then take from helkalimbat or from vinegar (that is, prepared gluten), a small amount; and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed a well-centered piece on top of it; then insert it into the ear's hole with ease, after you have removed the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If therefore it does not come out by all that we have said, then hurry to cut it before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of cutting is that a lancet is applied first to the head; and draw blood from it according to its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn the ear upward, and make a small incision in the base of the ear near the fat in a depressed place; and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you using instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then, open your wound at your hour (time) with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falls into the ear from among the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal (extraction).
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey your attempt to come out, then take a thin, fine pledget, shaped as such.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that kind (species) of grain from those that fall into the ear and do not come out; and do not do this when you believe that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you place many fragments (pieces) thereon: then remove it with tweezers, or with a thin stick, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction will be facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to use sneezing with incision at first; and already his ear has been filled with some warm water; and there lies on top of it (the water) the ear.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out through that (opening), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small, soft stones (pebbles), and warm them slightly with fire; and the sick person shall insert one of these into the ear's opening; and let him spit on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, he should not cease doing it with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out in such a way that you shall take one from parchment or reed and insert its end into the ear; and you shall light the other end with fire until it is burned much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do this repeatedly until all the water comes out; and remove it with a syringe according to what was said about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering into it [the wound], if it is small like a louse, and similar to it, care should be taken as I have said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body, which appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with forceps and tweezers; and its removal is easier for all who are required to pull it out from the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it with what I have said in division, and in treatment of distillation, and your care does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there [in the ear] of worms, then extract it with forceps, or with fine tweezers.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 But if nothing appears there [in the ear], then take a cannula whose form is constricted below and wide above; and insert its fine end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick person can bear; then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this often until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you for exiting, then surround the head of the worms with a cannula and beeswax, as I have said in stone [a chapter about treatment with ointments].
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I have said, then administer the distillations that were experienced by the ancients in killing worms; and you will find it in treatment of distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow be with oil and medicines into the ear with this tool, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 Make it [the instrument] of silver or brass, constricted below and wide above, with a small hole.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Let the pressing part which is on the concavity of the cannula be made of well-made brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take the radish, and insert it into the ear opening with a suitable lining: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you prefer into the cannula; let it be in gold: then insert the radish with the cooked [substance] on top, and press it gently with your hand until the oil is driven into the hollow of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside: and whatever is poured into the ear, let it already be heated slightly with fire: and take care that no substance which distills very cold is put in it; for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 On the Care of Ear Blockage (Auris).
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When some infants are born from the wombs of their mothers without perforated eardrums.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 It also happens to some people that ear blockage occurs in the cavity of the Ear due to a wound or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the Ear's cavity, which is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the cavity, which can be seen by the eye.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the Ear and is not apparent to the eye, is difficult to cure in many respects.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which can be seen by the eye, one must place the sick person's Ear on the sun and observe it; then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a fine spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small notch, part of which is sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be flat on both sides so as not to injure the Ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If the blockage is due to flesh born in the Ear cavity: then hold it with a fine hook and cut it out gently but powerfully until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If there is an opening in the deep part of the ear: then take subtle radium, leno, and heat it slightly with fire; afterward send it into the ear's flesh.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you find that the patient is weakened by illness with hearing difficulties, try to open it (the ear) easily; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the opening you made, wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and soak it in rose water, sprinkle powdered alum over it, and use it (as a poultice).
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see that the ear is already suppurating: then it is necessary to remove the linen and allow it to be covered with another piece of linen, wrapped in a cerotto made with rose oil, until the warm suppuration settles; then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding (occurring): then immerse sponges or cloths in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the rest of the treatment that removes the mentioned bleeding in the section on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on Altheli's Treatment for Eyes (Eyelids)
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These are the Althelils that occur in the eyelids, which are sometimes wet and are sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, you must hold them with forceps or tweezers: or with a hook, and cut them at their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place it over the place of the bite, grinded.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 They often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Chapter on the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 It often happens in the eyelids that something similar to a crab occurs, which is hard and tough, and because of this it is called a crab; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the procedure in them is to examine if there is a crab emerging from it, which appears on the eyelid, and they move around in all directions, and its substance is soft.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find a split on her (it) in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it from all sides easily, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut off the pouch.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small cut, then it harms the weak in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the split is large: then bring it together with stitches: and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Ointment indeed restores and fleshes it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the sand is turned towards the inner parts of the ear with the surface facing inside, then turn the eyelid inward and hang the sand grain with a hook: besides requiring a cut, press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched out by an incision, no harm will come to you from it.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after the sand grain incision with salt water: and care for the place where it is until the weak heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 Section on the Care of the Eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The translation is: "Axirnath is a cyst that is generated in the upper eyelid's covering; and it most often occurs in children; and it weighs down their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them due to this, and therefore you see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are wet below the eyebrows, which have already been inflated; and the appearance of Axirnath is evident to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The translation is: "The method of treatment for it is that the afflicted puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 The translation is: "Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare within it a linen square according to the size that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 The translation is: "Then place it on top of the square and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 The translation is: "Then find in the middle of that moisture with a narrow incision made, and it should not be larger than the one made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 The translation is: "Or it is necessary that you find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many positions Axirnath comes out of the incision in the shape of a white lump.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 The translation is: "So pull it out with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers towards the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses; and be careful not to add in the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 The translation is: "If Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you add a little more easily into the incision until it comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Submerge the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the spot, then sew it with small threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among humans are those who crush salt, and place it into the hollow of the crack, so that it softens what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a boil occurs at the spot, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 [Heading: Methods of Ataxmir for the Eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and weeps as it should not.]
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs appear in the eyelids that are in addition to the natural hairs and turn white: then they harm the eye and cause illnesses such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir indeed is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, as was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or it is cured by incision and sewing (of the eyelid).\]   Aut curatur per emplastrum temperatum cum medicamento ad un
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 or it is cured with a plaster made mildly warm with medicine as I will say. Or with reeds, as I shall tell you.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You must place the head of the sick person on your chest.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand. \]   Et si vis bene curare Ataxmir, debes postea accedere ad incisionem, secundum
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 Therefore, if it has been turned, that is good. If, however, you wish to cure the Ataxmir well, then afterwards approach inc
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert a needle into it where the thread is on the underside of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which hairs grow: then pull the thread upward along with the eyelid, and turn it with a spatula.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find, within the internal part of the eyelid, under hairs added with a spurting spout coming from the greater lacrimal until the lesser lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw out the thread, and place a small speck of dust from boiled egg or cloth underneath the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; since it has been varied among humans for a long time.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 From this [it is] one who needs to be cut from the eyelid in quantity large, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the spurting spout find above two lines which you marked, and start from the greater lacrimal until the lesser lacrimal, and let there be one crack near the natural hairs, as the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scour it all.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then sew together the two eyelids with a suture using a fine needle and thread, remove the blood, and make any excess from the threads adhere to the eyebrows with some binding materials if you wish to do this; but if not, do not worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the stitches and threads for three or four days, then take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, let the wound heal without stitches, and take care of it so that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid will rise when pressing on the wound and sewing it; but it will be better later.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treating wounds was taught by the ancients (Ataxmir).
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, in this there is concern for the sick one, and it is from a good operation, but there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that signs on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then pull the eyelid with three separated or gathered hooks, according to the following shape, then cut off what remains with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it does not fit: then take a needle with thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the greater tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather threads equally between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then pull your hand with equal pulling; and pull the skin where it is marked by the cut, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound with stitching; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If however an abscess occurs at your incision or your wound crack: bandage it with wool and similar things from healing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes also turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you use what we have said in the incision; but suturing both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 Chapter on the care of Ataxmir with teeth.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is to turn the eyelid and cut the crack that is inside, as I have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two teeth or two thin sticks whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of a fingertip; and you have already cut at both ends from both sides where you hold threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather both together with thin material over what remains from the eyelid of the eye, and tie two teeth from both sides tightly with a strong stitch, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 The tightened skin will die and become darkened and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If delayed [in healing], then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has solidified, lift the eyelid and do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the form of two scissors, as you shall make according to this shape and measurement for length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 § On plucking painful hairs from the eye with a sharp instrument.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is that you take a subtle point and insert a fine silk thread into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather the ends of it and knot them both with a very subtle knot, and let the length of the threads be one palm [width].
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then combine another fine thread beneath it in a short distance, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then place the weak head of the patient on your lap and bring it close to the sun so that the operation may be clearly seen, because the operation is subtle or delicate.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the fine point with the scissors into the root of the eyelash and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw the hair up to the scissors and insert the scissors into the hair; if it is one, or two, or three, do not take more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out of the eyelid along with the plucked hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the scissors are pulled out without the hair coming out of the eyelid along with it: pull the scissors downwards with the thread that you have prepared in it until the scissors come out from the upper opening and are visible to the eye; then, when you pull the scissors and the thread, draw both of them out, close the eye and let the closed eye heal for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and new flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then either bind a long hair from natural hairs with it and lift it up together; or leave it alone until it grows out a little, and then lift it up.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 On the care of Alzacter's condition that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this Alzacter's condition occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And Alzacter's condition is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental form arises from the consolidation of a wound, a cut, a cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operation is to open that consolidation and to separate its edges, and to place a piece of linen gauze in it, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not necessary to use in the treatment of this condition things that dry and tighten, for if you do so, Alzacter's condition will become worse than it was; rather, use soft things such as flaxseed: and embrocation with water, in which althea has been boiled, linseed seed: and ointment of djaquilon, which has been made liquefied with some oil: and wrap it with linen, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And your treasure of healing is to strive with all your skill so that it does not consolidate again in its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And this operation that we have mentioned is not other than a correction of Alzacter's condition, so that it does not return to its original form entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 On the care of Alzacter's condition that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a ridge or contraction upward towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This Alzacter's condition that occurs below is properly called Alzacter's condition.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 From wound, or fracture, or cautery, and similar things it becomes accidental.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The way of the operation in it is that you receive the needle, on which there should be a double thread, and you dye it in flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the flesh towards the upper part with a knife, and cut it with a broad lancet.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If then the figure of an eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take radium, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their extremities be from the two angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they come together a figure is formed, and it is a Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh to the extent of its sharp lower part, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join the separated parts; or sew it with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what I said, with softening medicines and linen cloths, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if the Alxatratus happens from the fissure or stitching or cauterizing: then it is necessary to make a flat wound under the eyelashes, even as it was before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with linen cloth, as I said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the discussion on treating Alxatratus, whether it is above or below, is that the treatment should be performed according to the preparation for the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For indeed it has many diverse forms; and the skillful craftsman prepares his talent with whatever means is possible for him, until he brings back the figure to its natural form or close to it, and himself who is ill, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up; or stretch it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula without sharpness of the spatula cuts, but rather bluntly somewhat; so that the weak one will not be disturbed during the operation and the spatula will be removed and not harm the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like you scrape off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it; or distill it onto him from sifon made of zinc dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth; and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye; and after three days use zinc ointment and with salves, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 Chapter on incision of nail and protrusion of skin around eyelashes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is of two kinds.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nervous: and is similar to horn, but delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 It is not a nerve, similar to the consistency of frozen white moisture; when iron touches it or one tries to grasp it with a forceps, it is torn away and the forceps do not take hold in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither of the kinds begins except from the greater tear duct, up until it gradually reaches the eye, until it fills the sight, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then collect a few double-spaced claws with forceps and extend them upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a spear and insert a horse hair or ox or sheep hair into it, let it be a thread, and slightly double the end of the spear point, and fix it in the middle of the claw; penetrate it with the spear and tie it with the thread to the claw, and extend it upward; peel off the side of the claw following the pupil as if you were holding it with the hair up until the end of it.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small forceps; let the natural tissue of the tear duct remain, so that no persistent flow of tears occurs due to its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the claw is extended with forceps alone; or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula, which has this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the soft spatula does not touch the corn layer and cause a break there, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt or made from chalk into the eye and let it stay until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of him with what is required, until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a probe into it nor apply a clamp to it, then repeatedly treat this kind of nail with medications, and it will heal as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye and take a thin, soft, weakly sharp probe of this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And shave the nail from above with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes rarefied and crushed, and press a razor into it, then drip from your hour (urine) into the eye made from seif or from ziniar, or from red seif ground fine: and keep the eye closed until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the operation on it until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless a hot abscess appears in your eye, then leave it alone and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation on it with delicacy, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 The growth of the flesh on the eyelash, if it causes great harm to the eye, is to be suspended with a clamp and cut off that part of it; not too deep so as not to disturb the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then drip red seif or seif made from ziniar into the eye until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on Incision of Albucasis and growth of flesh in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 Sometimes in the eyes of men there grows red flesh composed or laid on top, covering the pupil or approaching it, or pressing against the eyelids and perhaps turning the eyelids toward the outside; and it resembles a balustrade rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The operation in it is also to place the sick head in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and collect the entire flesh with suitable hooks to it; hold it with a single forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until you finish it all with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 Take care not to touch the eye during the operation; make your cut be such that it is made as we have described in the incision of the nail, or with tweezers like those used for asbestos, according to the shape it will take after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is completed and the entire nail-root is removed, then fill the eye with salt solution; or drizzle into it red powder and similar substances from corrosive medicines; and place over the eye on the outside a cotton pad with egg white: to protect it from a hot infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some of the nail-root remains and hot blood prevails, and you fear a hot infection; then leave the eye alone, and treat it with what soothes an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure over it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly do with any flesh that happens to be present in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Nevertheless, any weakening of the eye from a natural or accidental cause must be treated by cutting with iron; and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member is able to withstand this treatment.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on removing asbestos from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Asbestos are veins of red color that cover the eye and impede vision; they weaken the eye day by day.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, first you must consider if the eye in which asbestos is found is strong and there is no other illness except for asbestos; then collect the asbestos of it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is that you command the sick one, that he places his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with one or two needles according to your judgment: and let the needle be fine of double fold, according to this shape, or let there be two needles graduated in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect with fine forceps those veins and remove the blood by the hour, until you see the veins removed from the eye and resolved: and be careful not to hurt the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your work be at noon before the sun, and be very firm in your work: so as not to cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then distill into the eye green or red: so that with its own acidity it burns what remains from the scalpel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days until the pain subsides: and bind it with warm poultice: then again repeat over it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter on reducing Arissatas (nasal polyps) to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The surgeon is called Arisatha, and he treats the Fistula, which he cures with a cautery or with a medicine burning sharply, according to his narrative that has gone before.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it is not healed, then there is no skill in this case, except to open a boil at its birth and remove all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone is exposed, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then grind it with an instrument of this form.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called Asperga for the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron and round its head like a needle, pierced by the grinding of a file or a finely-pointed aliskilfer; place it on the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it over between your fingers and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been ground away; do this repeatedly.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with very dry ointments.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is stopped; and forty days have passed, and it does not break open again, nor develop an abscess, nor does anything else happen in it; then you know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, then there is no skill in this case, except to lead the fistula back to the nostril, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is to be exposed from the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine; when the bone has been exposed, then take a gimlet according to this shape, its tip being made of iron, triangular: and let the wood of it be a pyramid extended to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself; let it be near the tear duct; and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels it weak; by this you will find wind coming out of it when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Then restore the place with medicines that dry (or stop bleeding), as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh grows and the place hardens, then what was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter above the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 [Section Title] Reduction of an Eyeball Protrusion.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes entirely and no harm or reduction occurs while looking at it: then it is necessary to loosen the patient; next, phlebotomy should be performed on him; afterwards, place cupping glasses in the neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place a liniment on the eye which is made from acacia, aloe, myrrh, and colophony.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye above with plaster and many small stones.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of the small stones is: take soft cloths, many, and cut all the cloth from them into four parts; make many from these; then place one on top of another according to the quantity that the eye requires; then bind them strongly with a stiff cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat cupping glasses with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the cupping glasses, and release the bound eye day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the binding again becomes soft, then it is necessary to bind it very tightly; then remove the binding after a day and night, as previously stated.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see the eye has returned to its original position, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, the small stones, the binding, and the cupping glasses until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Chapter on the incision of the eyelid.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a rupture occurs in the tunica Vuea, it then protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of Vuae, and fouls the human form because of this; and there is desire to cut it: then surgery on it is necessary, as I have told; and it is to introduce a point into the root of Vuae from below to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another point with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and release the first point according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie a piece of Vuae around it with the point; and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the point, and place wet wool on the eye's white; and leave it until the thread falls with the Vua.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye so that it is comforted, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the Vua is tightened from all sides with a ring made of cloth, until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and moistens the white of the eye, and the eye sinks, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 [Title] On the cure of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called Alcomnat is not other than pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation in this case is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared chair or straight-backed one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take hold of his head with your hands from both sides and move him until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is shaped, and does not fall down, and the vision is cleared; and the sick person sees as he saw before: and if it does not fall lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If however the descent of pus is not prepared as we said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a thin probe and pierce it through the cornified panniculus continuous with the cornea at the junction with the tunica cornea in the corona, until the pus is expelled.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour warm water into which you have mixed honey over it; or hot water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the care of water that falls into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the type of water in division and which is suitable for perforation in speech declaring and explaining it, then take the same according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit with your hands facing each other, opposite to the eye, near the sun; and tie the healthy eye, and squeeze it very tightly; then close the eyelid of the affected eye with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye; or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand with a large spoon, if the eye is the left; or your left hand with a large spoon, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the almadga near the corona proximate to the apparent lachrymal of the smaller eye-socket; then push the almadga with force, and you will roll your hand together with it, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye; and you will feel that the almadga has reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that there be a measure for the journey of the almadga to the depth, a measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and this is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For indeed you will see it in the pupil of the eye itself, due to the clarity of the cornea coating.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the almadga up until where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it downward once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees immediately whatever opens his vision, and the almadga in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If therefore the water descends, then put it down in the second place, beyond which the almadga emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is clogged and does not rise, then extract the almadga with ease; and you roll your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from salt in water of the gemma, and wash the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place over the entire eye all wool soaked in rose oil or linen and the white part of the eye; and bind it with a clean bandage.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We and those who are in our time place over him camphor powder with the white part of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the almadga does not obey you in entering the eye due to its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard; then it is necessary that you take Spatholea (Alberid), whose form is as follows:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Perforate only the connecting tissue and not the final joint; and it is not to be done except to make a passage to a subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce almagda, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 Prepare for your procedure a well-made bed for the sick person in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room; and keep him free from movement, coughing; and put food for him that soothes his nature; and do not let him turn his head to either side at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the ligament remain according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve that in the dark room and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then bring back the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 It should not be done during the hour of cure or immediately after cutting; rather it should be done by others because water rises quickly through a vehement heat.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If, however, an abscess occurs that is hot: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and rectify that with what calms the abscess until it is calm; then remove his sight from him and place on his mouth orally whatever regulates his sight during several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then leave the house gradually and change into your clothes.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not allowed to be absent from view often; then he dares at the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 Now someone from those of Alayrach has arrived who said that a large perforation was made in Alayrach where water flows out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore I have not seen anyone in your country who has done that; nor have I read it in any old books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are the shapes and appearances from the hand, so that they may stand upon him who knows them not.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make from bronze: and let their extremities have the same subtle triangular shape, and the extremity be sharp.
Formae magda.	 Great forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Treatment for the born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes in the nose are born diverse fleshes added, of which there is something similar to the many-footed scorpion; and from it there is a cancerous flesh, stony, dark colored; and from it there is one that is soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 In the one that is among these fleshes soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you must make the sick man sit facing the sun, and open his nostrils, and thrust the hook into those fleshes; then draw them out to the exterior, and cut what you have grasped with a subtle spoon-like instrument sharp at one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If anything remains from that one whose removal is not possible; then shave it with a subtle instrument with ease until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you, or a hot boil occurs; then oppose it with the necessary remedy; or if it is among the malignant boils, then hurry to cauterize him, until the blood is removed and all fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then vinegar, or water, or wine is thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nostril opens and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that he is well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is born flesh within the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots; and place between every knot an amount equal to a digit or less; and make the sick one send out one end of the thread into his nose with a probe, or as he can do after he has done this, similar to the aze; and pull the scented substance until it reaches the cavity, and exit on his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many times boys do this which is similar to that of Attomus in schools; and it is easy for him who desires it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one which exits on the nose and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then as a servant, sew together the flesh with knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then pull out the thread; and put linen in the nose after bloodletting which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more, until the ointment has completely corroded what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then at the end, put a tube of lead into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If however there is need for treatment to dry it, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the purge to be made with oil and other medications into the nose, make it of silver or copper; it should be like a small lamp, open as a shell and its opening similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell instrument for the purge should be full, pierced; to which there should be a handle at the end of it, with which you hold it when heating oil or what you wish from juices and flowable things in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 On the treatment of nasal ulcers.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Many times is born at the end of the nose, Thelul, and it swells, and grows larger with days, until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of that, it is necessary to cut it at the beginning of its appearance and to remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the spot either cautery or medicine burning in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the cutting of it is delayed until it swells, then consider if it is hard, stone-like, dark colored, and with few senses; then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous boil.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen that one cuts a boil, and great evil comes upon him who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the boil is soft and not dark colored, and you see that it can be cut completely, then evacuate the weak, and cut it without fear, without dread; and take care of the place where it was with the remedy to draw it out and constrict it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Section on the stitching of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is loosening of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation does not help much unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from it, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its blood; and then gather together two strips of the wound with suture; then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the loosening of continuity of the lip has already separated and each part is healthy; then it is necessary to remove all the edge from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then gather together the two lips with suture and bind them; then sprinkle over it the powder of dragon's blood and pulverized olibanum; and put on top of the powders a piece of an emollient plaster and any other consolidating plaster; and let it be bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it (the suture), and change the medicine: and let it be until the threads are separated by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to gather the solution of continuity with needles, as we have said in abdominal sutures: or gather the solution with thread, as I have told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the removal of neck nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many men occur, and often in the inner parts of their own lips, hard ulcers similar to grains of grain: and some of them smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you turn the lip, and cut on top of every node of it, and hang it up with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then you shall fill the place after the cut with lime until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is scraped with vinegar, and the place where there is hardening is rubbed with it, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on the incision of the flesh of a newborn on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients called abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it is necessary to hang it up with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at the root, and let the pus run out, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then put on top of the place lime or other healing powders, drying.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after treatment, which often happens, then cut it again the second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on filing of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When the teeth accumulate on their surfaces from inside and outside, and between the gums rough, dirty, and sometimes they turn yellowish or greenish, until corruption reaches the gum and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, and put his head in your lap, and file the pulp and tooth, where the gums appear, and it is like sand; until there remains nothing of them, and similarly do for yellowish, greenish, blackish, and others, until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore that which is in them at the beginning of reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then apply reason to them on another day, second, and third, until finally study reaches what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires variously shaped razors of many shapes; according to which it is prepared for your operation: therefore, because the razor with which the tooth is scraped from below is different from the razor with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 These forms of the razors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you cure Tooth from its pain with all your skill, and be not hasty in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 There is not another to take its place when it is extracted: because it is a substance that rises high: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then if one who is sick must extract it, it should be made firm, and the tooth in pain should be certified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Often pain deceives the sick man and believes that there is worm in tooth and extracts it himself: then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen that from phlebotomy. (referring to bloodletting)
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the tooth in pain is certified by you, then it is necessary that you make an incision around the tooth with a spatula containing something of virtue, until the gums are loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps first slowly, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place the large forceps in that place with a good grip, and hold the head of the sick one between your knees: for what you have well held, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out then take one of those instruments and introduce it below it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or worn away then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with the end of a delicate radius so as not to break it during your constriction above it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you must be careful when making an incision around the gums from all sides a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And guard your strength so as not to break it and a part remains of it and returns to the sick one from that mischief which is greater than its initial pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in haste, and because of their arrogance in excision, except for what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they bring on great afflictions in men, which are difficult to break, and the roots of it remain all or some: or that they extract it with certain jaw bones: as we have often testified this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is to be anointed after excision with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If bleeding should occur from the places (for it often happens), then rub something from beeswax and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if you do not have beeswax.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of fine forceps with which the molar is moved should be long at the ends, short at the grip, thick, so that they do not split when pressed upon the tooth: as you see, those of the thick handles, until when you tighten them, they do not slip and do not split: the tips should be short and made of hard iron or well-made copper, pointed tips: and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into some and hold tight with a decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the tips are like the shape of a bird's beak, which is called a ciconia, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains after the extraction of a tooth that is breaking, then you should place hot cotton over it for one or two days until the place softens: then insert algaster or forceps, whose tips are similar to the beak of a bird called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This form is forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The ends of them (forceps) are made like a plane's edge, or as an aliskilfeghi (a type of forceps).
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If therefore it (a part of the body) does not come out with these forceps, then it is necessary that you be careful on the root and expose the whole flesh and introduce an instrument which is called a small Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let the end (of the forceps) be short, thick somewhat less: and let it not be filled with liquid, so that it may not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If therefore the root comes out through this (instrument), it is good: and if not, it is necessary to aid with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The form of the first triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form of the subtle triangular end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also it (the operation) is aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which have been mentioned in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also aid with this instrument similar to a large nail, whose form is the triangular twisted end with some thickness, so that it may not break: and let it not be filled with liquid.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not accounted, and a skillful artist, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to what is signified by the operation and the illness itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because from illnesses there are those for which the ancients did not find an instrument, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If however the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the face, or it rots: then to investigate on it (the tooth) itself in its place with that which suits it from among instruments and forceps which I have said for extraction of roots, and aid with gesti whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Place something of some thickness in it [the wound], gradually so that a bone can be held or tied to it, and it does not escape and move away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with appropriate medications for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small rottenness in the bone, then shave it off from its rot, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the setting of protruding teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly shape arises from it; and this occurs particularly when it happens in women and girls, that is, in those who menstruate.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not settle or can be set, or its removal or trimming is not possible; then uproot it: and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this tool whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak and is made from iron with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And your cut should be such that you make the incision over many days and because of the hardness of the tooth so that another tooth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is protruding and exposed to trimming; then trim it with a file made of iron whose form is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It should be made entirely of iron and the handle small with numerous sharp points like a file used to make a needle; with which you can trim the tooth gradually over many days with ease, so that another tooth is not disturbed and it falls out: then smooth it gently, in the end shave it off with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth that breaks off and injures the tongue; then it should be filed down until the roughness of the break is removed and leveled: and smoothed, so as not to injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 On the twisting of teeth with threads of gold.
Caput XXXIII.	 Quid autem de extractione dentes in quibus
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 In the case of teeth that have been struck or jolted due to blow or accident and the patient cannot hold what he eats without it falling out; and treatment with medicinal poultices has failed; then it is appropriate for them to be threaded with a gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And the thread should be of medium thickness and coarseness according to its quantity that it may fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the twisting is that you take the thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then wind it with its two ends between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the healthy tooth on the other side with the needle.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then wind again to the part from where you started; and hold your hand with delicacy and wisdom until it is completely removed; and your pressure when threading the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and join both, and turn them towards each other; and hide these under the healthy tooth and the moving tooth so as not to hurt the tongue; then release it when tightly fastened.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it loosens or breaks, thread them with another wire and it will remain in place for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth and the shape of twisting two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 Sometimes a tooth or teeth return to their place after an accident, and are held as we have said, and remain; this is not done unless by an experienced craftsman who is both wise and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a bone from a cow is made suitable: and it is formed like a tooth and placed where the tooth is protected and tightened, as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 On the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The operation in this is to open the weak mouth of the patient in your chest, and lift the tongue; then cut that nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its holding.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotty in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound; then thrust a hook into it and pierce it across its width until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful that there is no opening in deep flesh, and do not cut an artery there and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is washed with rose water or vinegar or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a flannel of linen under the tongue for the patient to hold at all night so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If blood flows out, then place onion paste over the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the blood resists you, then cauterize the place with a flat cautery that is suitable for it; then care for it yourself until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 On the removal of ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it swells so much that it fills the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 The operation in him is, to open the weak bone in the sun's presence: and examine the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see him of dark or black color, hard, which does not have a weak sensation, then do not touch it because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is hollowed out towards whiteness, in which there is wetness, then throw a hook into it and cut it with a delicate spatula and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 What if blood presses you during your operation hour, then place upon it a piece of zinc until the blood is separated; afterwards return to your operation until you draw it out with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then cleanse it with vinegar and salt; care for the rest of the treatment as suitable to that until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 § On the cure of two boils, the Molar teeth.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 When sometimes they happen near the throat, that is, the glands which resemble the goiters, which appear outside; and they are called the two Molar teeth: when you treat them as we said above in division, and they do not heal, then examine.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard boil of dark color with few sensations, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is of red color and the root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing blood flow; rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And then either you will pierce it or it bursts by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is of white color, round and the root is subtle: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 The operation on it is, to examine it before the operation itself, if the boil has stopped being hot and quieted completely or has decreased slightly: then let the patient sit in the sun with his head in your lap; open his mouth, and take a servant between your hands and press his tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Make it from silver, or brass, that it may be as delicate as a scalpel.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When therefore you press with it your tongue, and the boil is shown to you, and it falls upon the same (boil), then take a hook, and fix it in the boil, and pull it out as far as possible, except that you pull something along with it from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it (the abscess) with the instrument which has the following shape:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 The forceps are to be made similar: however, the tips of it should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other's sharp point: therefore, care should be taken that it is made of iron or brass coated with lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a pair of scissors having such shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Let one part be sharp, not the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after cutting one almond, cut the other according to the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, the sick person shall rinse with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If bleeding occurs, rinse with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle, and similar things from willow bark, until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than almonds may occur in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, cut them as I said for the incision of the two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have been cured of a woman who had a boil that was born in her throat, which dragged her to asphyxia, with few senses, which almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through a narrow mouth, and she had already prohibited food for herself, and drink of water: and it was about to reach death, if it had remained one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The boil had risen only so much that it discharged two branches, until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I approached quickly and fastened one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it, and a large piece came out.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it where it was seized from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I made that which came out through the other nostril hole.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I fastened a hook on the boil; then I cut off part of it, but nothing else ran out except a little blood; therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, then ate food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from the boil for a long time; and the boil grew in place of what I was cutting until it became too prolonged and with her, [it seems that] I have made it worse.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I made an incision and burnt the boil at her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore it stopped growing; then I went away from there, but I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 [Section on the incision of a boil in the throat.]
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends to the throat and becomes a boil that is long; then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called uva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what I have said in the division, and there is no improvement; and you see that the boil has become warm and thin; then it should be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what has gathered around it is round and not long, and it is red, dark or black, and there is no sensation; then it should be cut off.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the sick person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have said from whiteness and length, let the sick person sit facing the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose description has preceded; then fasten a hook in the boil, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 It is necessary that you not cut from it, unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 If you cut more from it, you harm the voice and discourse.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then, after the incision, use what we have said concerning the incision of two tonsils and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the sick person is afraid of the incision, then it is necessary to use skill in cauterizing it without fear and cowardice.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not anything but with sharp water and it is, to place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press the tongue with the tool that we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take water from the water that I have told you in the chapter on cauterization and melt with it an unquenched lump of chalk and do not make it thick or thin, but fill the hollow of this tool with it, whose shape is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the concavity at its end where the medicine is placed be concave like a conch shell's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the tool with the medicine on the wound itself: let the sick person lie on his side so that the saliva from his mouth runs out through the internal medicine, so that something does not descend from it to his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 Then you apply it to the wound for the first time with a quantity of half an hour, until you see it darkened and the pain of the medicine subsided.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour the cotton with the medicine over it, and insert the radius into the canal above it until the cotton sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let it go: indeed it dries up and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to apply medicine again, apply it again: and after cauterization, wipe around the area with a cloth soaked in butter and clean it with that which is in the surrounding area from the medicine: and pour cold water over it.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 It shall be treated externally with plasters and internally with poultices until healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than surgery and less to be feared.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is treated with a method that is more subtle than cauterization and surgery: it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, ruta, sassafras, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs: mix all of them or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil them: the pot should be coated with clay properly: there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an instrument concave according to this method is placed.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it from silver or bronze: and insert the end, where there is a grain, into the sick man's nostril, until the vapor reaches the ulcer through the tube, until the ulcer is covered with a lot.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then apply it many times over it until it dries up.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Usually pus is added to the abscess: and it should not be done unless at the time of the abscess's decline towards heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not available to you, then take a cannula and make a layer of ox horn at its end so that the sick man's bone is not burned: because the ox hide prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is a good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Item, si quid in gutture positum inveniri sit,
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Also, if anything found in the throat is bone or fish spine, or something else...
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, whatever appears visible from among them [bones or fish spine], that must be extracted after you press the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and when it is made clear to you that it is in the throat...
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And whatever is not visible and hidden in the throat, you should make a gentle vomit before the food is digested in the stomach...
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps it will come out attached through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick person swallows a piece of nutmeg or radish root, or a piece of dry bread crumb; or he may take a soft piece of sponge dried and bind it, then swallow it...
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When the place where the spine or bone is reaches, and it is extracted, it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out with what we said [vomiting], then use an instrument made of lead in this shape...
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be larger than a finger joint, and at its end, let there be a hook, which can easily be inserted into the throat; and it should have a head raised upward...
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so that it does not cause coughing and push the bone or spine with it, or a doctor may insert his hand...
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick person inserts is better [for extraction], since he has knowledge of the place where the thing is attached; and he should push it down or pull his hand with the instrument upward, all according to the size that is prepared for him until it comes out...
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 On the extraction of leech.
Caput XXXIX.	 Head, XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech (sanguisuga) is treated as I mentioned in the division of cure with medicines and it does not help, then consider if there is a problem in the throat of the sick person in the presence of sunlight, or after the sun if you press his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your sight falls on the leech (sanguisuga), remove it with a small hook or with fine forceps carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (small hook or forceps): then take a concave cannula and insert it into the throat of the sick person as far as the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this repeatedly, and let the sick person refrain from water for the entire day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; wash his face with it, and swallow nothing from it; move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech (sanguisuga) immediately when it feels water falls off.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what I mentioned, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs or with asa with the instrument that I told you about for fumigation of the ear.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this repeatedly, because it will fall off by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live plums with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, through the middle of which there is an opening; and arrange the end of the instrument in it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech (sanguisuga).
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 The bloodsucker falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat multiple fumigations.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 The sick man endures thirst, eats salt and other things, but drinks no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore, it is necessary that he goes out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is drawn from the throat when it falls upon the same eyesight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you see; but it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And the end of it resembles the beak of a bird called ciconia, in which there is roughness like that of a file; when it grasps something, it does not let go of it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 [Title: On the opening of abscesses, and their section, and care in general.]
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL (40).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to the remembrance of them, that is, one and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforation, and their section from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is of the kind of abscess within itself and because it contains moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second method is concerning places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in joints: and each of them has its own judgment by operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And among abscesses there are some that should not be pierced unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and there are some that should be pierced while they are raw and do not mature according to its completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and prolongs itself, until it becomes putrid perhaps the tendons or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore it is the cause of closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is an abscess near a main member; because if you delay the piercing of it until it matures, it will harm either itself or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, pierce it when it is immature; and it should not be pierced, if the abscess is raw, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not become putrid deeply, and reaches the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of the piercing of the abscess when it is matured according to its completion; and this is in sedation of pain, decrease of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess; and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and with greater prominence: and the perforation should extend along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, and in the regions of shoulders, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all places without reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which are reflected, go with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that (time), the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many dirt and foulnesses, and perhaps its lips harden, and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body due to necessity, or according to that limb which requires it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you make a small perforation for small abscesses and a large one for large abscesses, or numerous cuts according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are abscesses in which the skin must be concaved: and it should be cut when it has become like cloth, and made into a form that is already dead: such as what happens with boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And there are some which are to be cut through a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from it is cut in the form of a myrtle leaf (figure).
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 As an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And from it is administered a round cut and a crescent-shaped cut, and similar ones: such as those from cuts.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 The thing which has no head, such as are soft ulcers on the surface, should be perforated with a shallow perforation, or only a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 When the ulcer is large and already has collected much pus, and you have perforated it, so that it does not burst out and you extract all the pus at once: rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then, remove the ulcer up to another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then, extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this often according to its progression, until it comes out: especially if the person is weak in strength, or a woman who is pregnant, or a small child, or an old man who has decayed: for the animal spirit is often resolved with the exit of pus: and perhaps the weak one dies, and you do not receive payment.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Be careful then, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 After your perforation, which you make for these ulcers, it is necessary that you clean the wound and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If then the wound of the ulcer is small, or if it is a plain incision, then apply linen cloth or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 If the ulcer is large and there are many perforations of the fissures, then you should insert linen into each fissure until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 If you have cut off a piece of skin from the ulcer, or if you have hollowed out its circumference: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when a cloth is sewn together, or made into linen yarn without moisture: and tighten it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then throw it away, and care for it with whatever is necessary from the ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If it should happen that there is a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after the linen cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the site of the blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen, treatment, and powders which I have described in many parts of this our book, and according to division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the place of the boil is many nerves: then it is necessary to pour warm powders with wine and oil, and place them on those areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary to place warm powders soaked in water, oil or wine and oil, and all that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, then it is necessary to dissolve the boil, remove it, and administer treatment for its healing until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is necessary universally for the knowledge of treating boils.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the way of distinguishing it, I have already said about every boil, how is the path for its healing chapter by chapter individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on the cutting of boils that occur on the head skin.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 In the skin of the head occur small boils, which belong to the species of nodules that are contained by bags, which are like they themselves have been sucked by a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 From them are the fat ones: and from them are those that contain moisture similar to mud: and from them those that contain moisture similar to frozen slime and powders: and of such like, and from them are the hard stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in cutting all of them, and their removal there is no fear if there is no contradiction to the artery in their sectioning.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in cutting them is that you try it with the instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 If it contains moisture, then dry it by section along its length using a surface incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And start by making an incision from line b to line g. When moisture is evacuated, then scrape off the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many times it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt. Fill the wound with this mixture, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 The remaining part of the cyst corrodes itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then apply Egyptian ointment to the wound again on the second and third day, as often as you need it, until you are sure that no part of the cyst remains, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If an abscess contains a thick knot, then cut it according to this form, making the incision in the shape of a cross; insert forceps between the sections and scrape off the entire mass; and try your best to extract the layer containing it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If it interferes with an artery, then do as I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And the same is to be done for an abscess that contains a stone, by cutting it out and treating it in the same way as described before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The incision on an abscess containing a stone is easier because there is less blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are such abscesses located on the head of certain individuals where there is no moisture inside them.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I have made an incision on an abscess on the head of an old woman and found an abscess that was as hard as a stone, rough, white and unbreakable; if someone hit it with a blow it caused injury.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other kinds of boils occurring on the head, except for boils that occur on children's heads and around the roots of ears, a section of them all should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Always make a perforation from the bottom part of them so that the flow of pus is directed towards lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for it with what suits it from the healing process.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § On the incision of goiters on the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These boils often occur on the neck and under the shoulders and groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And above the boils that occur on the neck, there is one and many; and they are generated one after another; and every goiter among them is within its proper tunica, as it is in nodes and boils of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The forms of these goiters are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For they are stone-like; and some contain moisture; and there are also malicious ones that do not obey the healing process.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, when you see a good one among them, which has a good color close to the skin and moves towards all parts, and is not attached with the neck muscles, groin or artery, nor deep, it should be incised superficially from the upper part of the body to the lower part, along the line b to the line g. Peel it off from every side. Spread two layers of skin with a scalpel or several scalpels if necessary, as we have said for boils on the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is advisable not to cut an artery or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the scalpel not be very sharp; so as not to injure your hand during the incision or disturb the sick one, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or artery, then stop the operation, then place in the wound alum powder or certain powders which coagulate blood, and suture the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the lancet subsides and the wound softens: or if it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 Since the blood has been coagulated, return to your operation until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask with your index finger if there remains anything from the Strophulus or other small ones: if so, cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein in the root of the Strophulus: then it must not be cut from its root; instead, it should be tied with a double strong thread and left to fall out naturally without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with old linen that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the entire Strophulus is cut off, then it must be gathered with two pieces of wound edges: and sew it immediately, after you see that there remains no superfluity.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains some superfluity due to the size of the Strophulus, then it must be intended for cutting its root and pulling it out; and administer the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains humidity from the Strophulus, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that you may see its maturity; and place the perforation below, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer after perforation linen with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see that the wound is clean; then take care of it with ointment for regenerating flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 "On the section of the epiglottis due to strangulation within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Title (Roman numeral): Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 "The ancients said this section was performed on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 "However, in those with synanchema (a condition where the epiglottis is stuck to the back of the tongue), it is necessary to perform the section on the epiglottis; because there will be no help through this procedure, as all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 "In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, throat or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the nostril, it is necessary to use the section on the epiglottis, to prevent the loss that occurs due to strangulation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 "Therefore, when we want to perform the section on the epiglottis, it should be performed under three or four rings of the epiglottis with a small section across its width, in that area between two rings, because the section should be made at the sifac (a cartilage at the base of the epiglottis), not in the cartilage; this location is suitable for the section as it lacks flesh and blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 "If the physician is afraid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 "Then he shall incise the skin until he reaches the nostril; he should drain the blood vessels if he sees any.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 "Then he shall perform the section on the sifac as previously mentioned; it is noted that from the mucus that comes out of the nostril, when it is ruptured, and with the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 "And leave an open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 "When the hour comes when strangulation is feared, bring together two lips of the wound skin and only the skin itself (without cartilage).
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medications that cause flesh to grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 In conclusion of the story we narrated, there is no explanation unless they see that one of these abscesses has already opened in the throat of the sick man: and he was raised up above death, and desired to be cut: they go to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick man may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain breathing and save himself from death: and for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open, until the malice of the disease is consumed, and the malice of it lasts three days, almost as if it were itself: then they therefore commanded to suture the wound, and to care for it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I myself have seen is that a maidservant took a knife and sent it into her own throat, and cut a piece of the trachea of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called upon for its treatment, and found her to groan, just as is the groaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore I uncovered the wound, and found blood which had come out from the wound to be little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 So I was reassured that she herself did not cut a vein or an artery: and air was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I therefore approached the wound and cared for it until it is well: and nothing happened to the maidservant except a cough in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Chapter on the section of the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This abscess is called hernia of the throat, it is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is much more common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It is according to two modes: for it is either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly, there is no skill in the natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental is according to two modes; one of which is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode is like a gangrene that occurs from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 There is fear there, and it should not be presumed with the iron, unless in what is small; and you prove it, and examine it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty knot and not suspended with some veins: then cut it, as knots are cut; and draw it out with what contains it from the cavity, if it is in the cavity; and if not, then search the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with that which is needed for treatment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Section on the cutting of knots.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all their species in division; and it is necessary that here the difference between a knot and an ulcer be explained, since there is doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore, I say that when an ulcer is heat and fever and violent pains until the effervescence of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is completed, then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But a knot is not heat or fever, nor pains; and it contains them within the body cavity or a sac which is proper to them; and it is closed like a pea or a gourd, and it forms like a bulging tumor, and it is major or minor.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And there are two kinds of them: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a knot, it is necessary that you examine it and inquire about it first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to its form as described in the chapter following this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of examining boils and all knots is to take this instrument and insert it into the moist place that you find in the boil; then move your fingers slowly with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, lay your hand on it according to the measure of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove the Intromissum and observe what comes out with it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If what comes out running is moisture of any color, then cut it off with a surface incision as I have said in the treatment of other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 If no running moisture comes out of the Intromissum, then know that it is fat; so cut a cross-shaped incision over it as I have told you, in this shape, just as I taught you; and peel off the skin from all sides easily; and keep a container over it if possible to extract the pus with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the container breaks during the operation and it is not possible to extract the pus, then extract it roughly until there is no more left of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if there remains a little or much, the knot returns most frequently.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it overpowers you and there remains a little of it, then fill the wound with certain corrosive powders; bind up the wound, place hot compresses on top of it where the boil sits, and take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore it is a large knot, then its two folds [should be] cut and care should be taken of it along with that which has grown together.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is a pulsating vein that is opposite to you, or not pulsating: then go near, and fill the place with soft wax, and leave it compressed for two days, or three, until the wound rots and the boiling of blood subsides: then return to cut what remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Chapter on External Instruments for Cutting and Perforating.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Of these (instruments) are the shapes of Intromissors, and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 One is large, one is medium, and one is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make them from iron with square ends properly so that they can enter easily into the opening.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the shapes of Experientials, and they are named piercing instruments, and one of them is called Beris, which means piercing: and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these there is great, and middle, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They meet so that they may be treated by lancing, excision, fistulas, and abscesses from the bone that is among them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And some become rounded, smooth, blunted, like the tips of large needles which are placed on handles, namely, from jasper or brass or iron or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 The better ones of them are those that become from jasper.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And also experience is made from black lead which meet so that they may be tried for fistulas, the concavity of which are reflections, so that they may return with their smoothness to those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because from them are long ones, medium ones and short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form of uncions (uncini), and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because from them are simple ones, namely those with one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And from them are blind uncions (uncini): and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And from them are uncions having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and from them are uncions having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of knives (scalpels), which cut and scrape nodules, and abscesses: and they are of three kinds: because from them is great, middle, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The ends of them that make the cut are sharp, other ends are not sharp: and they are placed thus only so as to provide help in scraping nodules near the fear of incising veins or nerves: and so that he who is ill may be cured by it, and find a little tranquility from burning which he finds during the scraping of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magda, and they are species of three.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of copper and resemble a radio, from which alcohol is made: at the end there is a hole called Spatumilis, which can be opened to allow it to run both internally and externally as desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of Spatumili that are hidden among the fingers for the perforation of abscesses: the weak do not feel them; they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of Ventosari with which the flow of blood is cut off: they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them out of copper or citron, round, slightly shorter than you see, and be delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And these species of Ventosari should be large and small at your disposal, so that you can cut off blood quickly when needed, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy parts: such as thighs, hips, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar places, from fleshy, moist areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the gourd, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the site of phlebotomy or incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on the treatment of human breasts resembling female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LIV (47).
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they start to become dirty while sleeping), until they resemble female breasts; and abscesses remain filthy.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Who therefore shrinks from it, it is necessary to cut across the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line 'b' to line 'g'. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Fill the wound with a dressing made of incarnate medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bring together two lips of the wound with stitching, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If however the breast hangs downwards and softens due to its size, as happens in women: then it is necessary to make an incision in its two upper sides with two similar crescent-shaped cuts, of which one contains the other at their ends so that the larger encloses the smaller, according to this shape from line 'b' to line 'g'. Afterwards scrape off the skin between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what I said about suturing and powders, which is necessary for the healing process, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If however you do not make the incision that is required to be made because of the agitation of the patient or due to bleeding: then it is necessary to fill the wound with a dressing soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Chapter on the piercing of an abscess, which happens under a tumor.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under a tumor are of the types of hard ones containing cysts and those containing moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those which contain moisture must be cut open with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line 'b' to line 'g'. When all that is in the abscess has been drained out through pus, then fill it with old dressing and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the wound, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the boil is of the kind resembling knots from thistles, then cut it over the top, as we have said when cutting thistles equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 But if the wound extends such that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we have said in what has been discussed earlier.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Chapter on the incision of boils that happens due to an Artery and a Vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery bursts and the skin above it consolidates, it often happens that a boil forms there; similarly, this also happens with veins so that a boil and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that a boil and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: because when a boil is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the boil with your fingers, it feels as if there is a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is due to a vein, is round in visible parts of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And incision over this boil is an error, and especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care should be avoided with the iron, and if there are any of these also in the extremities or in the head, it should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, over that which is due to the swelling of the artery opening, make a cut in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, then the artery; and release it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a pointed instrument under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread at two places, as I taught you in extracting two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet, until blood that is within it all comes out, and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a cure that produces pus until the ligaments fall off: afterwards care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is due to a cut vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess along with the skin from it.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then introduce a probe under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and there should be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good ligament: as I told you before, on the ligament of the vein, at two parts with two ends, with two threads.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then introduce another probe with another thread under the whole abscess near the incision: press and bind your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in half, until when it comes out what is within it: then cut off the excess skin, and release that which is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place a poultice made of wine and oil over it.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a cure with linen cloths and suitable ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter on the abscess that happens from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with an abscess in an Artery and Vein, similarly it happens with an abscess in Nerves: which happens to them by a blow, or happens from excessive labor, and similar causes: and it occurs most often in places of joints, or the heel, and in every place where the connections are moved: and it is a heavy abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is found in several positions without pain: and when it is pressed with violence, one feels weak, similar to faintness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And it is not an abscess gathered deep within the body, rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not reach forward or anteriorly, nor backward to posterior areas.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, what is in the joints, should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, in what is in the head or forehead, puncture the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and scab it; then remove it and close the wound with stitches: care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 Section of abscess, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Occasionally, in some men's bellies, and in their other bodies, there appear growths called Fungalia, which resemble mushrooms in nature.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Their root is subtle, and the head of them is thick, and their lips are turned inwards.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there is a small one among them, and there is one that can be enlarged greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have already seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths, which were more like mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with fine roots, and their lips were turned inwards, and they festered, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I then cut them and found one to weigh approximately X VIII ounces and the other about VI ounces. The operation for cutting them is as follows: consider if the patient is weak or sick, and the growth is white, moist, and fine-rooted; then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauterization irons ready in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often much blood is expelled during the cutting; therefore, be careful if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, fearful, and timid person from the cutting with iron, then take a properly made lead thread, and bind it with it; the method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add lime to the lead stringing.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore, do not cease to bind lead, whenever it is pressed into the growth, until it is cut off and falls away without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the growth is large-rooted, then there is some fear and dread in its cutting; particularly since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 It is possible to cut the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then heal it, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware not to cut what is of dark purple color, with few senses, foul appearance; for it is a cancerous boil; and I will come again after this, when I remember the Crab.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the treatment of hernia of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A protrusion of the umbilicus arises from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It comes out either through a hernia of the scapula (what is above the abdomen) and that is called an umbilical hernia or it comes out through the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It comes out either from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, as has been mentioned earlier.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or it comes out due to a constipated gas there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a hernia of the scapula and it protrudes like a tumor: then its color is similar to that of an abscess or body and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its position, as we have said, is of a more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns and possibly there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath and causes severe pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If however it is due to moisture, it is soft; then when you press it with your hand, it does not hide and it is not compressed nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs appears an abscess that turns black at the root.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 If it is due to flesh born (caused): then it is a heavy, large, hard abscess and it festers according to its size.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 But if it is due to gas, then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 The procedure for this is to consider whether the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein or gas; then it is necessary to prevent its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and dread, as I have taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses due to an artery or vein are dangerous.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to an intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you command the sick one, so that he holds his breath and stands extended and still.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark [the area] with hot wax around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then command him to lie down on his back under your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then encircle with a broad bandage around the navel over the place you marked with hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the incision upwards with a large spoon.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around firmly with thread or with silk cord: and the knot of the ligature should be a square knot.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the extended incision above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you then find it [the hernia] already caught by the ligature: then extract the hernia sac, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then take it with the spoon, and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however it is an artery or vein [affected]: then bind it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circle you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tie the abscess in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the rotten flesh extends: and falls by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is necessary from ointments until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is from a soft flesh or moisture in him: then hollow out the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 You shall draw out blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on treating Cancers.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already stated in the division of Cancer's species and the way to treat it with medicines: and beware when treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate. We also said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and warned against cauterizing its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is at a place where it can be eradicated. Such as cancer that is in the breasts or hips and similar limbs, which are to be extracted entirely when possible: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it becomes ancient and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was unable to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone before me who achieved that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is placed as we said, is to precede and dissolve a patient from black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then, if you find phlebotomy itself with obvious fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which the operation takes place.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then throw hooks that fit into the cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Afterward hollow out the cancer from every side with skin, as examined, until nothing remains of its roots; and let blood flow, but do not cut it quickly, rather press the areas, and remove all thick blood with your hand or if possible there with tools.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however the flow of thick blood from an incision of the artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 [Section on the Cure of Hydropsis]
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now discuss the division of hydropisis species and how water accumulates; and the signs for each species and its treatment along with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is cured with iron is not but the asclitis species alone; it does not approach iron for the timpanitis species; nor deeply for the hyposarca species, since it is lethal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already been treated for this hydropisis species of timpanitis with medications and the treatment did not work; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already become weakened or there is another illness besides hydropisis; such as if there is coughing or looseness of the bowels, and similar cases; then beware not to treat him with iron because it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see the patient overflowing with strength and no other illness besides hydropisis; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then there is room for operation on him, that you lift up the weakened person standing between your hands, and afterward, the attendant presses his abdomen with his hand to force water downward toward the lower part of the breast.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a thorny spoon in this shape:
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be of two sharp parts, long, and sharp-pointed at the end like a spoon.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something short in it to prevent you from passing through with it during the operation as far as the intestine and damaging it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if hydropisis generation is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a section from the navel a length of three fingers downward directly above the breast.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if hydropisis generation is due to liver illness; then make the section on the left side from the navel a length of three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let there be a section on the right side: and it is not necessary that there should also be a section on the side towards which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert your hand into that section, and scoop it up with a spatula between the skin, and scoop out, as if you are peeling it; let the quantity scraped off be the size of a fingernail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the spatula until the spatula reaches an empty place: and that is where the water is.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it, and insert the instrument into the opening, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it resembles a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or brass, linen, cleaned; on the lower part of it there is a small opening, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other; and the tip of it is slit, according to the way of cutting a reed, as you see: at the upper end of it there is a band.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument; therefore let out a moderate amount of water by the hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 For if you let out more than is needed from it, perhaps the sick person will die by resolution of his vital spirit; or a syncope occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 However, let out from it according to its potency, and according to the signs given to you by the pulse of the sick person, and the quality of his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 That is because it is retained immediately due to the skin which holds the opening that is on the spatula; about which I told you to pierce it in that way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see the patient able to bear it; and also remove a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Probe it for a few days without fear, and be careful to avoid error; until there remains only a little in the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and let out much water; then care for him with warm sand, many sweating in a bath and sun, and wait for his thirst; and care for him with most drying medicines, until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver, after removing the water; as I told you in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants born in places where their urinary tracts are not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When anyone of the infants comes out of his mother's womb, and the head is not pierced by a lamb's forceps, or the opening is narrowed, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, help him by immediately piercing with a thin spatula such as Spatumili.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin nail made from lead into the wound and tie it; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wishes to urinate, remove it and mix [something] with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then bring it back.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows upon the area does not allow the wound to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 But if his wound is narrowed, he is treated with lead as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 But those in whom the wound is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because the wound is at the end of the spine of the one who is born; therefore, he cannot mix it with urine towards the front until he raises the spine with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Nor is there generation in him, because the semen cannot reach the womb according to the correct direction; and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 The method of operation in him is that he lies down sick on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the spine of his head with your left hand with a strong stretch, and cut off the head of the spine from the location of the glans, with a pointed or sharp spoon-like instrument; like cutting a reed, or as you radish something, so that the middle comes out similar to the head of the spine: and so that the wound falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware of yourself during your operation from bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It often happens that this occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore oppose him with what causes the bleeding and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Chapter on Albater (inflammation, suppuration, rotting, blackening, and adhesion) occurring in the foreskin and head of the penis.
Caput LVI.	 Head LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albathers occur frequently in the string, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from it one is malicious, and one is not malicious.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, the non-malicious one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off until it is completely clean.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place on it a dish immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malicious and of foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery after its incision and its root.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If the Albather is in the foreskin of a captive who has not been circumcised, and part of it is within the foreskin and part is outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it hardens; then take care of it from outside. Because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal without weeping.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 Moreover, they also occur in testicles, and the scrotum turns black and rots.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should hollow out everything that has already turned black, and what is about to rot or has already rotted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then put linseed on it after that with honey that has been crushed with flour of pomegranate rind and sieved herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a flow of blood, then apply cautery with lunar cautery according to this shape:
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 Cautery is useful in two ways at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and when a wound is torn apart.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the string is torn apart and destroyed completely within an hour: then it is necessary to insert a cannula made of lead into the meat of the penis so that the weak one urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this kind of adherence does not occur, unless in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required over it: and sometimes adherence occurs due to a wound or an abscess. Therefore, it must be scraped off with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish between them, then it must be scraped off a little from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because when the foreskin is thin, it may be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is to be treated with wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Chapter on the purification of infants and their treatment due to mistake that has occurred to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuity, as are other wounds: but since it comes from our operation, with our will, and its use is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we mark a better outcome and an easier path leading to health in the procedure.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Because I have found a larger number of artisans and phlebotomists to use purification by circumcision with scissors and forceps: they use the treated, bound, and incised with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 I myself have already tested all these methods, and found no better cleansing with forceps, and no better binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because, in cleansing with a new scalpel, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower layer torn: it is therefore necessary to make another incision, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when cleansing which is done with an alfecat, that is, a finger, as the tailors use it, it is not possible to make an incision at the extremity of the male member: because it may enter the opening of it.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and ruins your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is naturally short, and often occur in this way, that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 Cleansing with forceps and binding with thread, a good experiment has revealed to me: because the sharpness that is at the top is like the sharpness that is at the bottom.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses correspond, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression forms, enclosing the skin with a rod from all sides, with which no error can occur at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is to make the boy understand, especially if he understands a little, that you do not do it except that you bind thread on his rod alone: and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible for you, from the fact that he receives understanding with his own intellect.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands of the right size, and not sitting; and hidden forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand to its shaft, and blow into the skin, and draw it up until the head of the reed comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it from that which accumulates in it dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then bind a little lower with another ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, and retain the position of the lower ligature well, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then lift the skin quickly upward, and extract the head of the reed.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (it is better), and place powder on top of it; and above the powder lay a cloth in which an egg has been boiled in rosewater, crushed with fresh good oil; and let it remain upon this until another day; and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let them have two pointed ends and let them be converging; let no prong of the nail come out at the ends; and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But error in cleansing is when the entire inner skin or a part of it escapes at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out from your hour with your nail before the incision of the place; and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a pair of tweezers, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If more than three days have passed and what remains under the reed is inflamed and unincised, then let it be; until the abscess becomes hot and scabs off easily, and cut it according to your preparation; be careful not to cut from the head of the reed.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 That will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Treat that with it which consolidates the wound from the powders, as we have said in the treatise on powders; and if it cuts into the skin beyond measure, and goes upwards, it does not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Treat that with it until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 On the extraction of a retained bladder stone.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder, occurs from a blockage made from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things from what we have said in modes of treatment, in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 If the urine does not flow and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he who is ill be laid low on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then his feet should be placed upon his back, and he should stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and he should contract his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is compressed to expel the stone, the urine flows out.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it does not flow as we have said and a severe situation is over the ill person: then it is necessary to administer extraction of it with an instrument which is called syringe, whose form is like this: It should be made from silver, and be fine, soft, concave like the reed pen of a bird in fineness, long like the palm of one hand and a half: let there be a fine cannula at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of urine outflow through it is, that you take a double thread and tie a wool or cloth, or good ligature at its end: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is too much from the wool, but introduce into the cannula with force, like pulling.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter and egg white: and make him sit on a chair, and warm the bladder, and his own member with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the syringe into the vein with ease, until it reaches the root of the vein.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it over at the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder and feels it weak as it enters the empty space: this is not done according to this order unless because the pathway where it goes has a tortuousness.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 The vein follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out, and let the vein run through the way of urine: and continue to do this, without stopping, until the bladder is emptied, and the weak relief is found.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Section on the quality of clysterizing the bladder with a syringe.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a wound occurs in the bladder, or blood in it freezes, or pus collects and there is a desire for water and medications to be poured into it: then let it be done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three holes in it, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 There shall be a hollow place where the thing that pushes is placed, according to the amount it requires without addition, until when something is pulled with it, it is attracted by humidities; and when it is pushed, with it is expelled to a distance: such as the Clepshydra does, which projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When it is desired to pour humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the Clepshydra into the humidity and pull with it what pushes towards the higher part; for the humidity is attracted in the hollow of the Clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end into a rod, as we have said in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the humidity with what pushes; for that humidity immediately reaches the bladder, thus the sick man feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle enema by which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it from silver or gold; its head should be higher like the almakah with a small opening, and under it there should be a space for a cord to pass through.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and put the humidity in it, which is to cleanse the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it with a strong cord between two openings and heat the humidity slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the clisterium into the rod, subsequently wrap your hand over the bladder with a suitable moist binding until the sick one feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If the bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it entirely from its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert the thread into these holes as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle as if it were sewn together: when you put into it what you wish from moistness, oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind it with an instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by expression with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 § On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said about the types of stones, their treatment with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in kidneys, bladder, and urinary tract, and its signs; we have also mentioned the operation on the stone with hand or section: this is properly a stone in the bladder; it is the one that hardens in the rod; I am telling you about this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder like water in its fineness; and there appears in it white sand, and the sick one rubs his rod, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it is erected, and exits with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of children is easy until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 In young people it is moderate, since it is between that which heals quickly and that which requires a longer time to heal. However, in the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; but if the stone is small, the cure is more difficult for that one.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we reach the cure, it is first necessary to clean the sick person with an enema, which extracts all feces that are within their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone during investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, shaken and moved towards the lower parts; so that the Stone may descend into the deep bladder or rise from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then let him sit between your hands, and his hands be beneath his buttocks; so that the bladder is entirely relaxed towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you therefore feel the Stone in a space, then immediately approach with section over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall with your touch at all, then you must anoint the index finger with oil of the left hand if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is an adult full-grown; and insert it into his anus; and search for the Stone until it is beneath your finger; and turn it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards against the place of the incision; and command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand; and command another attendant, to lift the testicles with his right hand towards the upper parts; and with his left hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a probe cutting, whose form is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 Find within him what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, to the side of the left: and let the section be made above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that it is a broad section externally and narrow internally, according to the quantity in which the exit of the stone from there is not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger compresses the stone that is within the anus at the incision point and exits easily.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know, that from the stone are those angles and margins, wherefore its exit is difficult on account of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is soft, similar to a gland, and round; and its exit will be easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To that which has angles and margins, add in the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not exit in this manner, then it is necessary to fissure above it; or to tighten upon it with a device whose tip is like the moon that tightens on the stone and does not slip away from it; or to introduce below it an instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot do this, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something prevents you from doing it with blood, cut it off with a lancet.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If the stone is larger than one, then push first and foremost on the bladder bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then push a little after this; and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the sick one of two things, either death or continuous flow of urine; therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it exits; or fissure its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with tar, aloe, and dragon's blood; tie it up, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; to let it sit and heal the hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick one on his neck, and do not undo the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you undo it (the bandage), apply balm to the place with much water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If a hot abscess or ulcerous eruption arises in the wound, and it becomes corrosive, as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prevented from passing: this is known to be when blood comes out with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it encourages decay of the bladder and its rotting.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it all kinds of things that agree with healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And it is necessary during the entire healing period to bind two thighs together and apply, because of the medicine placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the neck of the bladder and it obstructs the passage of urine, then care for him with what I have said before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you are excused from this treatment during the incision, now I have proved that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you should take a perforator made of iron, its shape is triangular, sharp and fixed to wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it to a rod under a stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Insert the piercing iron into the rod easily, until it reaches the point of the stone; and you turn the piercing iron with your hand in the stone gradually; and compress the piercing to make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 The urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It is broken and comes out with the urine, and heals the sick man.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from being done; then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut the rod over the stone between two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it (the piercing iron or stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards untie the knot and clean off the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And the knot of thread under the stone is not necessary unless it prevents the return to the bladder; and another knot above, unless when the string is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and this requires you to raise the skin over when you tie the upper string so that it returns to the incision and covers the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the removal of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI (61).
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Not much stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If a stone happens to one of them (women), then the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden because of the numerous procedures involved.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them may be that she is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second reason is that you do not find a woman who will expose herself to the doctor when she is a virgin or married women.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you do not find a woman well versed in this art, especially in surgical operations with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, distance from the place of the stone: for it requires deep incision, and this entails fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity calls for it, then one must take a woman physician who is well versed in this: but this is seldom found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if that is not available, then seek a chaste and skilled physician and a present midwife who is well-learned in women's matters or a woman familiar with this art: make her present and particularly instruct her to do everything you command regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, that if she is a virgin, then one must look to see if there is a finger that can be inserted into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If it is found, then twist it with the finger and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the weak vagina and search for the stone after she has placed her left hand on the bladder and press it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If the stone is found, then one must gradually move it from the bladder opening towards the lower parts with all one's strength until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then, it is to be cut on the side of the half vagina near the root of the hip from any part that is prepared for it, and one feels the stone in that place: the finger should not be removed from the stone while twisting it under it; and the incision should be small initially.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert a probe over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If it feels the stone, then add to the cut according to the proportionate quantity as the stone comes out from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the appearances of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From this it is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know therefore its appearance, so that it may be shown to you regarding the thing which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood conquers you, then add at its place zege tritum and hold it for one hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and do, so that you prepare yourself with the instruments, which I said for the removal of stones in men, to help you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If blood conquers you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which is cut: then put powder over it and tighten it with thread suitable for ligation; and do not move it; and leave the stone and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 [Title: On the Section of a Watery Hernia.]
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is not anything other than a gathering of moisture under the white membrane that contains the testicle: and it is called a sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And at times it is in its own panniculus which nature has prepared for it in the part of the scrotum until it is considered as another egg, and it is between the white membrane of the testicle that we mentioned: and this does not happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed, the generation of this [abscess] in branches is due to weakness that occurs in testicles: therefore, this matter flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens as a result of striking upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or it is of this moisture, which tends towards a citron-like yellow color, or red like blood, or foul like feces, or black, or watery white, and that is the most common one.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And signs by which it is known where there is an accumulation of water, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the scrotum, which I have said, then the abscess is round and shorter than the figure of an owl; and the testicle is not apparent because moisture keeps it from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is within its own bag [scrotum], then the abscess is round like part of an owl, and therefore a man will burst because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the scrotum [bag], then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When one desires to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture on an abscess with a square probe, whose form has preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which comes out in the track of the probe, judge about what is between it [the moisture and the probe].
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 Since we come to the cure with iron [lancet], then it is necessary that you first order the weak one to be bled if possible for him, and observe his body to be full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies on his back on a low bed, and puts many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on the left side of him, and command the servant to sit at his right, who stretches out his stick [lancet] to one side of two layers of skin of the testicles, and to the region of the groin [of the abdomen].
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad spatula, and cut the scrotal skin in the middle along its length, almost up to the ridge: and make the incision according to a straight line equidistant from the one that divides the scrotal skin, until you reach the white layer enclosing it: and scrape it off and observe it, or take care not to cut it off: and let your scraping be on the part that hangs down more with the egg: and scrutinize with subtlety according to the quantity, as much as possible.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Perform a wide opening of the spermatic sac with water, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with scissors and stretch the spermatic sac upward, without touching the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut the spermatic sac however it is possible for you to cut it, either entirely or partially, but especially the subtle side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine, there is no certainty that water will not return through the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If, however, an egg appears outside its sheath during your operation: then when you complete the incision of the spermatic sac, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then attach the two lips of the scrotal skin with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a rotten egg stained with blackness, then it is necessary to bind the vessels that support it, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its supporting structure and drain the egg: afterwards treat it as I said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If, however, water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: so cut the other part as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it appears to you that the operation should be one, then do it: afterwards cleanse the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert a linen thread immersed in oil or in rose oil inside the incision; and place an additional linen thread that you have soaked in wine and oil on its outside and expand it over both testicles, and search for the bowel opening; and place double cloths on top, they are poultices; and tie them up above with a ligament having six knots.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two pieces of linen are soaked in wine and filled with carminative herbs, shaped in this manner; the ends that are applied are pressed down with wet wool or linen; they are tied at the hips, and one end reaches from the anus to the back, while the other extends to the neck part; two ends are placed below on the thighs, and two more on the lower abdomen; all are tied in the loins of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this branch is artificially healed with cautery at the incision site using iron; it is to take a small, sharp cauterizing knife and cut the skin of the testicles; it is lit, as we have described; until the white sifac containing water is exposed; then take the cautery in this manner.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It is similar to the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that and set it alight until all moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then pull the sifac with tweezers and scorify it with a sharp heated cautery, cutting as much of it as possible until you have removed the entire thing.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to let the fire touch it (the wound).
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the opposite happens to you during the hour of incision or cauterization, if an abscess forms, bleeding occurs, or something else; then it is necessary to treat what opposes you with the appropriate cure, as previously mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If the patient is timid and does not await this operation due to its horror, then administer perforation according to what I have told you, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When it is informed to you by what we have said about meanings that the branch is watery, then it must be done that the patient sits on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide-mouthed spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until the water runs out completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a cloth over the place, and bind it, and let it heal the remaining water; then take care of him until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the hour when you perforate it, and this is not otherwise because a white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the outflow of water, then it must be done that a feather or instrument with which the water of hydropic patients is drawn, whose form precedes, is inserted into the wound, or add a small amount to the wound operation.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or approximately these.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it has collected, then it is to be drained in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the care of meaty branches.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the section on this meaty branch, there is danger of death through fear in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its release can be saved from this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am remembering the operation in this and the form of abscesses.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the body, from which the testicles are composed, and this happens for various reasons, such as.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 From an abundance that is sharp or acidic, which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 From a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And an abscess's color is according to the body's color and no pain is found in it; it is a heavy abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it comes from the knotting of arteries and their swelling; as has already been mentioned before; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is due to the swelling of the arteries can be recognized by the position of the abscess, when it is compressed with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it should not be touched completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But what comes from the swelling of veins is not discharged from it when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that a section may be made in this manner and on the remaining flesh; and it is to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend the egg upward and remove it along with a white piece of gauze; and release the suspenders from the bladder, and tie the bladder; and cut the suspender after you have released it from all parts of the bladder.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is consolidated with the born flesh, then it must be drawn and cut.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the scrotum or within the bladder; then it must be released entirely, and cut with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion that is behind; then it must be cut entirely and the egg should be drawn out, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards, take care of it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 On the treatment of roots, which concerns vines.
Caput LXIIII.	 Title: Caput LXIIII (Chapter LXIIII)
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 An abscess enveloped by a certain swelling, resembling a cluster of grapes with the softening of the testicles, becomes difficult to move and exercise, as well as walk, for a weak person.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness, there is caution due to the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, we must say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that you should make a weak person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the suspender of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the rods that are close by; and let another servant hold it and stretch it with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a broad, sharp transverse cut on the rods, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then remove all the scab from every part, as we said to you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a pointed tool with a double thread into them and tie it at the first places where vines occur; and tie it again at the last of those.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut them in half with a straight midline incision along the body length and remove what has accumulated from foul and corrupted moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then take care of the wound with the treatment of other wounds where the worm is generating pus, so that the vessels nourishing one testicle are discharged.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not harmful through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If vines occur in all the vessels, then they should be removed for this reason from the testicles with the vessels; lest the nourishment of the egg is deprived, due to the incision, and it rots or burns and is not useful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 On the treatment of Intestinal Worms.
Caput LXV.	 The head of the sixty-fifth chapter. I assume that this is a
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The course (of treatment) for intestinal worms occurs from an incision that happens when the sifach of the abdomen is extended over the lower abdomen near the flank of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the hernia or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types (of rupture) happen for many reasons: either from a blow, or from jumping, or shouting, or lifting a heavy object and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And a sign that it is from the extension of the hernia.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly; it is an abscess that is turned around deep within; for this reason, because the hernia compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And a sign of it when it is from the hernia incision, because it causes intense pain suddenly from its beginning; and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin near; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the outside of the hernia.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with a worm (zirbum); and this is called the intestinal worm (Ramex intestinalis) and worm (zirbia); and sometimes it happens with diarrhea.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and remains there; and that is with danger for the sick, because it causes pain to worsen, especially when it is compressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of the types of this disease with iron there is fear; therefore one must be careful with the risks in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to command the sick person to push his intestine back into the hollow with his hand if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies down on his neck upon your hands; and lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Extend the skin that follows the skin upward and cut the entire skin of the scrotum in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then bind the hooks of the incision to two lips of the incision, according as you need to open the incision with them; and the cut shall be according to the quantity, as much as is possible, so that the egg may come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the sheep's-wool sac, and what is beneath the skin of the scrotum, until the white membrane of the sheep's-wool sac becomes hard from all parts; then insert your thumb into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white membrane of the sheep's-wool sac, and between the folds, and without the adhesion which is on the back part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then with the right hand move towards the inner skin of the testicles; and with this stretch the white membrane of the sheep's-wool sac upwards with the left hand; and lift the egg from the sheep's-wool sac to the part of the incision, and command the attendant to stretch the egg upwards; and you dissolve the adhesion which is on the back part of the egg after the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And search with your fingers whether there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the hard white sheep's-wool sac.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find something of that, then push it down into the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the probe, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last part of the sheep's-wool sac, that is, the membrane, which follows the skin of the testicles after the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then prepare something of them on top of something with a shape that is in the manner of a cross; and tie the egg-white membrane (alshifa), which we spoke of, because it is a strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until no mucus, which nourishes them, can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 Place again the ligament second beyond the first ligament, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 After these two ligaments, let go of the sifach which is under the skin of the testicles, to the size of a finger; and cut the rest all around, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then, cut on the lower part of the skin of the testicles with a section where blood and pus run; as we said in what was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then administer wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound; and administer the ligament as we said before.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes burn the white sifach as was said, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 Let go of the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case delays, then boil with hot water; and place on top of it what was said before, until it falls by itself.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then, care for the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on Windy Nose (Rhinorrhea).
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this windy nose, I have not seen anyone who dared to cure it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And first they said that it happens as was said in the windy nose that is with worms (infestation).
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is to tie vessels after section above it with ease; then cut in the middle and care for later with what opens it itself, until the vessels fall out; and take care of the wound as we said before, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 Chapter on Disruptions that occur in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When there is a rupture in the groins as we said, and a place empties out, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it descends, it is too little, and it returns in every hour; but if this condition continues with that time, a fissure is added to the sifach (epididymis), until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And it happens from the extension of sifach, which is in inguinibus, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is, because sifach extends: then it softens, and the place is opened, and it drains.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its care is with cautionery, as its narrative preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And at times it is cured with iron, according to this manner: and it is that the weak one lies on his back upon your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of the rupture and draining, cutting along the width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie down the alsihafak and what are under the skin, until the white sifach is exposed, which is below the skin following it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a probe and put it upon the draining from sifach, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then two draining points are raised on the end of the radius from sifach, and tie them together with a stitch; then extract the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the alsihafak at all, nor touch an egg, nor anything else, as I told you in the treatment of the intestines' branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then care for it with the wound healing method.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 And when you make a cut, clean it, and restore the wound, until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For sifach contracts and no additional draining is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautionery is better in this place, because it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of the scrotum skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The scrotum skin is frequently softened in some men, because the flesh between it becomes soft and its appearance is foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat him, that he makes the sick person lie down on his back, and cuts through the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips together with stitching: and if you wish, or first of all remove the excess softened skin with three or four stitches, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then take care of the treatment of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 [Section Title: Castration]
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and therefore it would be permissible for me not to remember it in my book: and its remembrance is not necessary, unless because of two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it: and so that he may know the cure for him to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other reason is that we often need castration of some animals for our benefit through it, such as rams, gazelles, and cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by a cut and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in warm water until his testicles become softened and relaxed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are not noticeable under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In castration by cut and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of his testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspensorium, and cut through everything with one cut until when two eggs come out: then cut each after you have scoured it, and do not leave anything on them except sifak for the subtle part that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that by attrition because attrition may leave something from the testicles, which makes the animal desire copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then heal the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 [Section Title] On the care of hermaphrodites in two methods.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphroditus is from men according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is that there appears in it the space following (?), or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between two testicles, a figure like that of a female womb, in which hairs are present: and sometimes urine flows out of that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one species, and it is a female womb above the comb (?), like the small testicles of a man, protruding to the exterior: one of them is like the prick of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of three species, two from men, and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut the flesh added, until the impression escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 In the second species of men, from which urine flows out (?), which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the incision of tentigo and protruding flesh in women's ulcers.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A tentigo may be added on a natural matter, until it becomes filthy and ugly to look at; and sometimes it is magnified in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess of tentigo with the hand or with a hook, and to cut; and not at the end of the cutting, especially in the deep roots, so that there is no bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills itself; and perhaps it comes out to the outside like a tail, and because of this some people call the illness 'tailless'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, we should cut it as we would cut a tumor, and heal it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 On the treatment of an unperforated female breast lump.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The vagina should be whole, not perforated, or have a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The accidental [condition] is that which precedes the illness; it itself arises either from added flesh, or thin tissue, or fat; and it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or on its surface, either upper or lower; and it prohibits coitus and conception, and parturition, and possibly menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And the knowledge of this [condition] is obtained through the examination by an obstetrician, if the membrane rupture is nearby apparent.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the membrane rupture is from thin tissue and is near to two lips, then expel it, and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And place a piece of wool on top of the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman lie down on her back with her legs spread open.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch the two lips forcefully, until the thin tissue is torn apart and the membrane rupture is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take linen, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot; let the woman anoint this place every day to prevent the area from hardening with a scab.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the thin tissue is thick and fatty, then it must be cut with a broad sharp-edged leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the membrane rupture is from born flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; have medicines with you which stop bleeding without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and pitch mixed with sheep's milk fat.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from hardening quickly; hold it for some days; then administer dried flaxseed, and then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes is born in the matrix a birth of fleshes of another kind: it is therefore necessary that they are cut according to this manner: while it is not an apostema cancerous, for an apostema cancerous which is in the matrix, there should be no opposition with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 About the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor regarding red ones in women's veins.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of veins' orifices, until much blood continuously flows out from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thrombosed: and I have already said about their species and signs in the division of them; and here I will say what among them receives treatment, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those among them which are on the opening of the matrix above which sensation falls, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 It is therefore necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend Athehelil with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder over them near the flow of blood from one of the incisions without biting: such as ashes of incense, dragon's blood, thistle, and similar ones.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet to the wall at hour one.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and bark of pomegranates, and gallnuts, and similar ones.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If blood is cut with it, good; and if not, make adhesive ointments (to stick) to the back (wound) of blisters, and nipples, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathith, or the juice of arnoglosso, or the juice of branches of alaulat (aglanter), that is, fig tree leaves, Pontic wine, and make it sticky with beeswax.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess remains quiet, then take care of the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albath is red and resembles al-hassa heads, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut what appears from it (the Albath), as I said earlier on the thighs equally; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Chapter on Perforation of the Exitura that occurs in the womb (uterus).
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the womb (uterus) many kinds of abscesses occur, such as cancer, stone-like abscesses, sores, adubelas, alekilas (herpes), fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadias, thelils, and hot abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already said all these diseases and their forms, and the signs of them, and their cures, divided; it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is one of the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening with iron is made.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with striking and flame, and fever; and you see it redden upon it; if pressure is applied to it, then do not perforate it; and treat it in that way which helps for maturation, until when quietness comes to the acuteness of the afflictions.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair with two armrests, and she reclines or lies on her back, and places her feet at the lower part of the belly; and let her hips be spread, and she puts her arms under her thighs, and ties both with a bandage fitting to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife sits on the right side, and administers the tool for opening the womb's opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Its form comes to those who have passed.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you wish to administer this tool, that you perforate with the point of a deep probe the womb of the woman, so that what enters from the tool is not deeper than the womb, and does not harm the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the tool is too deep, then it is necessary that you place powder on top of the deep part of the womb; to prevent the entry of the whole tool into the depth of the womb; and it is necessary that you place a weight, which runs in the tool, on the upper side; and that you hold the tool, and turn the weight, until the deep part of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears to be excised and is touched with the hand and it is soft and yielding, then it is necessary to cut off that [thing] near its head with a broad lance.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the pus is drained, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil that contains some resin on the wound: and lay the linen cloth, and draw out the incision deeply into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 Place [something] externally on the matrix and on the bone a clean wool cloth soaked in water in which wormwood has been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it shall be treated two days later with an ointment suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and wound is washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or Aristolochia longa has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to prohibit its treatment with iron: instead, treat it as I have said in the division [section].
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Chapter on obstetrics, how to treat living fetuses that have left their normal position.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXVI (86).
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the shape of a natural delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, the signs of this [delivery] are as follows: when you see a woman pressing downward and desiring to smell air, and you apply pressure on her in the place of delivery, and she hastens the exit of the fetus: then know that this delivery is in its natural form, and it is an exit over the head of the fetus, and the second one with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press on her abdomen so that the fetus descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it [the surgical instrument] descends upon his head, it [the secondary one] also descends with it, and it should be purified from those superfluities by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 However, that which is beyond this parturition, is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus emerges with its feet first, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands; or it emerges with its head and one hand; or it emerges with the umbilical cord, and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar unadmissible figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in these matters, and to avoid error and deception; and I am showing all the figures from these, and how to understand them, and they are indicated by that, and they stand upon him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus emerges with its head in its natural passage and it becomes difficult for him on the woman, and labor is strong, and you see his strength already weakened; then let her sit on a chair or women hold her; and let her drink warm water with fennel cooked in it, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the obstetrician introduces a small spatula-like instrument between his fingers, and he finds with it the secondary one, and cuts it with his nail until what is in her from moisture runs out; and presses the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then she must be cleansed with fennel mucilage, with oil of sesame.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after cleansing to be pressed; and make her sneeze with snuff, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus shall immediately exit.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands come out first from the fetus, then it is necessary to draw them back gently.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey in entering (the birth canal), then place the woman on a chair, and lift her feet up; then strike the chair upon the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them (the hands) off and take out the remaining fetus; bind its hand with cloth and take it out equally, for it will come out by itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The emergence of the embryo is on his feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges on his feet, then you should push them up; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards straighten it equally.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they (the legs) emerge up to the hips, then command him (the woman) to push and make her sneeze with a pinch; for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then push the fetus back gently until you position it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For then it will come out easily with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is forbidden as we have said (to perform the procedure), then take from althea mucilage, sesame oil and dissolved gum; grind it well in a mortar with good pounding; then anoint the woman's womb and below her belly with it.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she feels relief (from pain).
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts of hers have become warm, then give her something made from myrrh and make her lie down.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When then it holds an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her abdomen with easy pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For feces will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Delivery over knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits in this manner, then insert your hand gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back, and let her feet hang downwards; and she lies down on the bed, and clasps her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently over her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then take out what is under her feet from the pouches until it is prepared below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take hold of her feet and move them with great movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently what is above the pubis until the fetus rises to higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hand and press the fetus gradually; and tell the woman to hold her breath until the fetus is delivered.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 Delivery of the fetus, hanging down broadly from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert your hand in reducing her hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then let her lie down on the bed; and strike her legs with strong blows.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then administer the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives her delivery, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to reduce the hand, and press the fetus according to its natural shape; and make her sneeze, and tell her to hold her breath until it is delivered.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 Delivery of the fetus on its back, with spread hands, and its face to the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The obstetrician must hold the fetus and then turn it gradually with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is evened [turned], then place upon its mouth as we have said from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair, and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command him to compress [the baby] and make her sneeze with powder.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The delivery of the fetus is prepared on the left side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the mother's womb in this manner with the second membrane, then cut the second membrane with your nail until it is expelled by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus hangs over the face and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the interior until you place her as necessary; and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will come out easily with an exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Delivery of twins or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 You should know that twins are often born; and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, this is an exception and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five is beyond nature and do not live completely; and it contains them, although they are multiplying, by a single second membrane; and they are separated by the siphac, distinguishing the tied one at each of their navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural and easy exit, and they come out through an unnatural exit as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult during childbirth and reach what we have said in the unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and invent every figure according to the one that is being prepared for him to save.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recall that which forms in the womb from embryos, and they abort.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it is already proven with me that a woman has expelled seven and another fifteen, all of them being formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this entire matter should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it may reach a similar one; therefore, confront it with that which is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 On the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus as I said in the division from medication, and it does not come out, and you will have to operate with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of good health and not with any accident from which it is feared for her loss: then it is necessary that the woman lies on the bed, on her back, and let her head be inclined downwards, and her legs lifted up; and the attendant holds her from both sides or tied to the bed, so that her body does not come out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the cervix of the womb with moist oils such as olive oil, almond oil, fenugreek and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician wets his hand with these oils and mucilages; then he introduces it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he seeks a place where he can insert hooks on the fetus, and places that are suitable for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore, consider then if the fetus is ready to descend upon its head; then insert hooks into its eyes, neck, mouth, palate itself, under its beard, in its collarbone, near the ribs, and below the hypochondriac regions.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If it is a descent (affecting) his feet, then make an incision in his breastbone and in the middle of his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that he holds a hook with his right hand; and places his wound on that which is between the fingers of his left hand; and introduces (his hand) with ease, and strikes the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until he reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then strike the hook another or third (time), if necessary; so that the constriction may be equal and not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it is extended with an equal extension, and not an extension only in a straight line, but rather moved to all sides, so that the opening may be relieved; as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary that in that place, the extension may be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is held back from it (the wound), then it is necessary that the midwife joins some fingers with oil and introduces them from that side to turn what is held back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then hooks are changed to another higher place; do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If therefore a hand comes out before the other and it is not possible to return it because of its bending; then it is necessary that a cloth be wound over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract it (the hand) until when the entire one comes out; cut it at the joint of the ankle or elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do this in both hands and feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the fetus is large, or there is bending at its exit, or water has collected on it; then it is necessary that a pointed spatula be introduced between the fingers and pierce the head, and extract the water; or break it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, perform [the procedure] if the fetus is large-headed by nature, then it is necessary to cut the hairs off [the fetus]; or pull it out with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and is stuck at the neck, then it is to be split until the moisture that is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not twist nor yield for an exit, then cut the head intermittently, as you are able.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is an abscess below the womb or it contains water (hydrops), then pierce it through until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is large-footed, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the bone of the womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it is stuck in the belly or chest, then pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and split the belly or chest until what is inside runs out from them.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If other members are torn away and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the bone of the womb is open, then insert your hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it, and pull it out with your fingers up to the bone of the womb; then insert a hook or hooks in it and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the bone of the womb is stuck due to a hot abscess that has happened to it, then it should not be pressed upon it, but rather administer warm liquids and oil; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisturize.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, then it can be turned; then administer what was said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it is not possible to do that, then it should be cut piecemeal and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary that you do not leave anything inside the seconda at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding warm cauteries that occur in the wombs (uteri).
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If there is a flow of blood, then it goes down in warm water and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again with another one, and yet another stillborn fetus was found in her.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 After a long period of time, she developed an aposteme in the navel, which became swollen until it burst open and began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 Therefore I was summoned for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 So I put on it some strong adhesive plasters; and the bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then after a few days, another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 Therefore I was amazed when there was no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, you thought that the dead fetuses were bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I asked about the wound and extracted many bones from her, while she was in good health; and she lived for a long time in this condition, and emitted little pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not bind this foreign body here, except that it contains knowledge and help for what the skilled physician administers when healing with his hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Section on the shapes of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of the Stricture Instrument, by which books are leveled; it has two equal spirals at each end of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Nevertheless, this Spiral should be finer than the Stricture Instrument; and for this purpose, it may be made of ivory or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all the wood should be about two fingers; and the edge of each of both is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half; and in the middle of two pieces of wood there are two additions made of the same kind of wood which have already been hardened on either side, whose length is half a palm and less; and the width of each of them is about two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, to open it when you turn the two spirals.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spiral that opens the Matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made of ivory or boxwood, according to the resemblance of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at its end there should be two additions as you see here above; and the length of all the additions is like a palm; and the width of each of them is about two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the matrix with it, then have the woman sit on a bed, her legs being hanging down, and that which is between her thighs be opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected additions into the matrix; and you hold the end of the instrument lower between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish for the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Dizziness Different Than That Which the Ancients Called Impetigo Fetus (Impulsive Presentation of the Fetus)
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form which breaks the large head: and it resembles a pair of forceps, having teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes wedge-shaped, as a pair of forceps according to this form, as you see, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form which crushes the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of the scissors having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of the scissors having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of the forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of the spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of two broad spatulas also.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are used, and the more they multiply in variety, the more prepared they are by the craftsman, is quicker for its operation, and higher among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore do not despise one of these instruments, as if it were not prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For the necessity of them is inexcusable (inexorable).
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on Second Extraction.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the second is retained at birth, then it must be commanded to retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with powder: and press your hand on her mouth, and her own nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If therefore it exits through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take the pot and pierce a hole in the covering; and place inside it herbs that open the cervix, such as calaminthe, root of ruta, anise, camomile, wood of senna, centaury, and linear cassia; take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the infusion of rushes on the hole of the covering pot and another end into the cervix; hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the uterus.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For second birth it will exit easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not exit: then order the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil or mallow gum.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the vagina and search for the second child.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she finds it, then take it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deep in the uterus, then insert the hand as we have said until she finds the second child and extracts it gradually in a straight manner so that the matrix does not fall due to violent attraction; rather, it should be moved with ease to the right and left; then add more according to the strength of the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It will obey then, and be saved, and exit from attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the cervix is constricted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and medicine from the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not exit with all that we have said, then beware not to tire her in the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 It is necessary that what comes out from the matrix bone should be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then, enema her with the four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will corrupt and dissolve her after days, and will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it corrupts, raise a bad smell from her to the stomach and head, and injure that which is already weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate fumigations be administered for this purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already experimented with a fumigation of nasturtium and figs dried in the sun.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument with which to fumigate the woman during the retention of the Second Stage and periods.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it similar to an alcamea vessel or a jar: and place the wide end over the fire: fumigation should be placed on plums: hold her while that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and the anuses of these babies are not perforated, which have already been opened by a sharp forceps.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife must pierce it with her finger; and if she cannot, she must pierce it with a sharp spatula; and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Place upon it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If one fears that it is obstructed, then put a lead tube into the opening and leave it for many days; and when the child wants to come out, it will be removed.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now, obliteration of the anus also occurs due to healing of a wound or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that consolidation must be cut off; then it should be treated as we have said before with the remedy and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodosity and swelling that occur near the anus outside; or in the space of one part; and it is a fistula or multiple fistulas.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When therefore that old knot is opened, watery white moistness or subtle pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And at times these are penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore they are recognized by what comes out during discharge, and by wind when the sick person uses discharge; perhaps a worm comes out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 There are fistulas among these when they penetrate the space to the bladder and to the bowel of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 There are also penetrating ones that reach as far as the hip joint and the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that which a penetrating fistula is recognized to the anus, it is also known from a fistula not penetrating, that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a probe thin in the fistula made of metal or iron, without twisting, if there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is twisting [in the fistula], then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it to the bottom and nothing comes out from discharge or wind or worm as I said; then you will know that it is not penetrating, so approach for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when a fistula is penetrating to the bladder or urethra; its sign is the outflow of urine from it and its prohibition from this, that the location be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it is penetrating to the hip joint or the hip bone; its sign is that a probe reaches up to there if there is no twisting up to the bone; and pain in the surrounding area, and that pus always comes out from it; and that medicine cannot be effective in it, nor does it consolidate with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these all penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their cure is labor and futility to him, upon whom they are formed, from foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with the lancet: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and there lies the sick one between your hands upon his back: and rub his legs up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined toward his own belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce the lead or copper, if there is a winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the sick one feels it near the anus, then it is necessary that your index finger be introduced into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you therefore feel the probe penetrate by itself, which is detected on your finger and between your finger and the fistula or flesh: then you certainly know that it is penetrating; so do not labor in it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that flesh heals in some men, and the remedy by which they hope for help is to burn cauterization as thin as the width of the fistula, as before, and to introduce the burning into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice or thrice until you know that all those added fatty tissues filtered, which are like the quills of a bird's feather, have been burnt.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then care for it with linen cloths in butter until those burnt fats come out: then care for it with ointments generating and consolidating flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it is never cured with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it (the tumor) escapes and does not reach your finger which is inside the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or scrotum between it and the tumor, or if you see a fistula on what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the tumor that is in the fistula until you reach the point where the extension of the scrotum ends, and the scrotum is released and falls off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those tissues which resemble the feathers of a bird's quill, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood prevails and breaks through between you and your operation, so that those tissues escape, then it is better and more speedy relief to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery with fire produces good results by applying heat to those tissues, charring of those added tissues, stopping bleeding, and drying out moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with linens wrapped in butter or cooked leeks until the place emits pus, and those burnt tissues come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with strengthening ointments that produce hard flesh; there are medicines containing styptics and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is restored, then it is cured; do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached deep into the anus and is stretched out by the body's excess: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine it with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel a tumor, and there is a layer of scrotum or flesh between it and yourself, which is close to penetrating: then there is no operation on that unless it is according to the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is, because it is administered in him one of the three modes: either to cauterize it itself, as we said; or to excise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen, and cure it from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with the excision, lest you cut into the flesh containing the anus, and it happen by accident an unfortunate outcome of excretion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cure that with what I said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will heal: or lengthen the same membrane and cleanse it after you have cut it up to near the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean those fleshes filtered which are in the excision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then strive for the healing of the whole wound with excision and superior opening where it heals; and the fistula remains open at the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula is drained in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take the probe perforated at its end, which is like the awl (aleskef), that is, prepared with calfskin, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread wound around five strands and around thereabouts.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates into the margin of the anus internally, then pull out the thread from that opening; so that you can insert your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together its two ends; and tie each one and let it remain for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the better tie it, until the fleshes between the two ends of the thread fall off and drop away; then cure the wound, until it heals and is cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If, however, the opening of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by any means prepared for you, unless it is in great depth.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you, there is no need to do that (make an incision) so as not to cut the muscle itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do it as we said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 Make the spatula for the spiny fistula, whose sharpness is very acute on one side and not acute on the other so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On sewing hemorrhoids from which blood runs after being cut; and on the treatment of fissures (fissure in ano).
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are hemorrhoids according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Either they are inside the anus, similar to coal lumps or prunes; or like grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from these there are small ones and large ones; blood always runs from them, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which runs either lemon water or a little blood with constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of those which are inside the anus is to order the patient to sit on hot water, and it is expressed until it appears outside the anus and appears to you as athelia.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, also hang them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held by hooks due to their moisture and their own softening: then take them with a rough cloth or a glove made of double wool and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them (the vessels), and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision for them to remain in place of the cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Either cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey to evacuation, then enema should be administered with a slight purgative, so that the sick person is cleansed with what is in the anus, and the evacuation is quick when the sick person releases it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the faeces are outside the anus, then their condition is light and easy; it is good to grasp them with your nail or to grasp them with a tweezers, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what I said before, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if the wound resists cutting with an iron, then it is necessary to apply suture to them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread rolled up and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then pull the faeces towards the top and make it penetrate with the point on its root from the other side; and wind up the ends of the thread around the point and let them be broad; and tie the faeces tightly with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread, and pull out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all faeces and leave one; do not leave yourself, so that excess of blood flows out from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch over the anus and place it on the anus; and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him be until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the faeces fall, take care of them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 On treating fissures (or cuts).
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often happen due to the removal of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they have become chronic and medicine is not effective on them: then it is necessary that you shave with a spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and the superficial layer which prevents their healing should be removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then treat them more forcefully than the first time, until they bleed much, and after that care for them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On treating an anus that is not right (or abnormal), and one that is normal: and about ulcers (Athelil) and scabies (Formicae).
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is only a round swelling similar to the head of a nail, colored like the body, and it occurs throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and pain occurs during walking from it.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 It is necessary that the part on the nail-like swelling be cut off and held with forceps or a nail, and it should be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that, and if you wish, cauterize it as described in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 From ulcers (Athelil), one is a small elevation, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 The treatment is to spread the ulcer (Athelil), and cut or prick it; or stitch it with silk thread; or pluck out the hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 If you wish, cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine; and now the abnormal ulcers (Athelil) and normal ones are removed with a tool that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 The translation of the sentence is: "Formica (ant) is also a small prominent filtrate, thick, on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply: and when it is found, it feels like a bite from an ant all over the body, and it mostly occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 The treatment of it is to take a cannula from a goose feather, or strong vulture feather: and place the cannula over the formica, until the circle of the cannula contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then rotate your hand with the cannula until it separates what is around the formica: and place it deep into the flesh, and pull out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with an iron or brass cannula in this manner.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the upper part of the cannula be bent upwards, pulling a mute roll towards it, to be relieved by its grip and rotation itself.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize the formica as mentioned before in the chapter on cauterization in Athelil's text.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the tools for fumigations applied to diseases of the anus, and solutions of the stomach, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Whence the clisteria is made of silver, gold, brass melted or hammered.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes these instruments are small and large, according to those in whom they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and for weak or painful anuses, so also the suppositories.
Clistere magnum.	 Large suppository.
Cistere paruum.	 Small suppository.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula's upper part where it is tied to the uterus should be wide according to this method: and it should have a distinct portion to be tied to the uterus as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, soft, very fine, drawing towards subtlety: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of rods, not too thick and not too thin, and let the uterus in which the medicines are placed be made from the bladder of an animal or from a sheep's parchment, shaped like a small asafetida bag, whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as is common, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread, perhaps made from raw linen, which should be about ten threads or approximately that amount, and gather it with the uterus like an asafetida bag.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When this is placed inside it, the upper part of the suppository should be tightly bound with two distinct parts by a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then apply the suppository with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the circular form depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of making the suppository with it is as follows: fill the uterus or bladder with medicine that has been heated according to the tolerance of the sick person: and be careful not for it to be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back, and lifts his legs upwards: and place beneath him something soft, that is, hide or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the extremity of Clisteris with oil, or with white goose fat, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the attendant receive the bladder with both his hands at once, and squeeze it with violence, until all that is in the Clisteris passes into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the Clisteris, and the sick person lifts his legs upwards to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If medicine forces him to evacuate, then hold him as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps the whole night with it, it is more of a cure.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you clisterize him with diseases of the abdomen and his evacuation is hurried: then clisterize again until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or painful sores in the anus, then let it be very subtle and soft, mild, from the Clisteris with which boys are clisterized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a soft Clisteris on which the skin is stretched tightly.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on the treatment of wounds of the head without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division of treating wounds that it belonged to a book, and I will say here the treatment with hands, and with medications according to the supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to how they are made, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, wounds made in this way are like being struck by a stone: or cut with a sword or knife: or pierced with a lance, or log, or arrow: and similar things from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to the parts of the body are such as a wound falling on the head, neck, chest, abdomen or back; and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the cures of some wounds, so that I may place the reasoning and rule over the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If it happens that there is a simple wound on the head and no bone fracture has occurred; consider then if it is due to a blow of a stone or similar object, and only the skin has been broken; and the wound is large, and you fear an imminent abscess of hot pus; then act quickly, and make a venesection of the head at once; and do not delay that; and draw out from him according to the potency of blood as much as possible, unless something forbids phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 Let the venesection be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let him be careful not to fill himself with food and heavy drinks.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something prevents reduction, then reduce the food, but avoid meat and wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And put on the wound if there is a hot abscess, warm infusion of cooked food in rose oil only, or with wine containing saltpeter.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from a hot abscess, then put on the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not changed air; and if the air has already changed, then put something over it as I will tell later; and if it has already changed air, then put some ointments on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large, or it is from a sword cut and similar ones: and its edges are not brought together by pimples, then bring them together with sutures, as I will explain regarding the wounds of the abdomen in the matter of their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound is already exposed from bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it unless in a small suspender: then cut it (the hanging part).
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh to it where there is skin deficiency, and instruct the sick man to eat foods with bulk, such as heads (of animals) and cooked wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the putrefied part, and throw it away; then take care of it (the remaining wound).
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be cut off by medicines: then probe for the artery (or vein).
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it up (with sutures).
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity compels and you cannot do what was said, then cauterize it (the artery or vein) until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If however, these wounds are small and simple: then the matter is easy and light; so that you sprinkle this powder on them, because it solidifies them before air changes (their state).
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Chapter on the Powder for Consolidation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Prepare one part of olibanum (frankincense), two parts of dragon's blood (a red resin used as a medicine), and three parts of unburnt lime: grind it thoroughly and sieve it; fill the wound with it, compress it well, until it adheres well on top, and coagulate it with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it above with sutures, and let it be, do not release it until it remains so that it does not come apart.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 The medicine is not to be removed from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And at times plaster alone does it when there is no olibanum and the blood of a dragon also does the same operation in many large wounds when it is suitable to be placed on them and they are bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has already changed it by some alteration, especially when it is in summer time, then there is no use for this powder: therefore take care of it with what I said, put some digestive ointments over it or make poultices from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the rest of the healing until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if a fracture occurs in the bone with the wound and it is small, then extract it with trepan; and now I will speak of the treatment of skull fractures that will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 [Section on neck wounds]
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve of the neck or the artery is already cut: if it is a nerve, there is no skill in treating it except to turn the treatment towards avoiding violent stiffness, such as ziniar and zegi and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they hurt nerves, and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is above the organs; therefore that which is to be treated should be made from soft medicines such as lime plaster mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil or rose oil, or pitch when washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture: or sew its edges with threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound is deep or if a sinus has gathered pus at its lower part, then puncture it at a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has already been cut in the wound and bleeding has occurred, then separate or sever it and tie it; or cauterize it if there is a need for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the windpipe has already been cut, either entirely or partially, and the trachea has been saved: then sew the lips of the skin over a reed for the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe itself; on the contrary, support it and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then bind it with a suitable bandage and let it rest for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then, care for yourself with ointments that contain styptic and astringent properties until you are healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it. If there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them or what can be removed: leave what cannot be prepared until the wound rots and separates, and the discharge subsides.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder over it as I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If there appears to be bone in the wound and a fistula is formed: then care for it as described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on Wounds Treated with Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound caused by a lance or knife and you see its depth, then consider the following.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If gas is discharging from the wound when the sick person is breathing heavily, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the wound is not deep and is recent with blood, then do not apply powder to it immediately or press on it so that the blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person: instead, place an attracting ointment on it and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If an attracting ointment is not available to you, then place a dry old cotton wool on the wound's opening to absorb what discharges from it due to moisture: make sure the sick person sleeps over the wound so that what collects there can heal.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred and there is no spasm, no bad heart tremor, no narrowing of breathing, and you see that the other signs are good: then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Cure yourself and with linen cloths, and the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If the healing opens again, and it always opens up, then you should know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Therefore, cure it from its root.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a sword cut or knife, and it is simple on the chest or back surface: then treat it with the suture that preceded it, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an indentation on the bone and cut off fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hurry to pull out those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, for the extraction of those will heal the wound.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 As for other wounds caused by accidents on other limbs, the judgement of treatment is as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on abdominal wounds and the passage of the intestine, and their discharge.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture that occurs in the abdomen can be great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, at times the intestine or number of intestines comes out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, insertion and suturing of those is required, being more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture can also be difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore it is more difficult to reduce it if you do not hurry in its insertion to its place immediately, because it swells, opens up and becomes enlarged, making the entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium rupture is better because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that suture of the vein is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two commons [types of] sutures converge in the suture of the abdomen, and in the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other types of sutures specifically communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen; and I tell you one by one, along with its exposure and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when the wound is small and something comes out from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to return it; then that is due to one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is distension in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When that is the case, then one should heat it thus, by immersing a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water leeks, cumin, dill, and ginger with the intestine, until the distension is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it does wine where there is stricture; and that is better than water alone for the resolution of distension.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see the distension is already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which ale or mead has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For through that the opening of it (the intestine) may be eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If the return of it (the intestine) is expelled after this treatment, then close the rupture with a little bit, using an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the cutting; and it is not to be forced for cutting after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it (the instrument for the treatment) be twisted, sharp, and another part not sharp, and the tip should not be fine like the point of a needle, rather it should be a little blunt; and that is similar to a lancet, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When a wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, it is then necessary that its reduction should be according to its own natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make him lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the wound is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consideration always in this way, so that the part where the wound is is higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 Therefore, it must be applied in large wounds and in middle wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it as it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure that a devoted servant is present between your hands who holds the wound with his whole hand and sews the edges together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then, cut some thread for the one who follows to stitch; and this is the common method of sewing one together.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is, that you take a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then release a quantity of finger width from the end of the wound, that is, of the doctor; and fix one needle beyond which you insert the thread into both edges of the skin, with both edges of the flesh that are under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already sewn together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh; and they become four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew together with thread twice around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are sewn together properly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the finger also, and sew in them another awl; afterwards draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first awl.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not stop doing that with the awls you require until you complete the contraction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the awls be of medium size between thickness and delicacy; for delicate awls pierce the flesh too quickly, and large ones have a difficult entrance into the skin; therefore it is necessary that they be of medium size in delicacy and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 It is not necessary that the awl be sewn at both ends of the skin close together; so as not to pierce the flesh too quickly, and open the wound before its consolidation, nor should they extend even with suturing, lest the wound be prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the awl so as not to injure the weak person while asleep; and place little woolen balls on both ends of the awl from every side, which will hold the end of the awl; and release them when you know that the wound has already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this kind of suturing with awls is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one or two needles, or around them, are sufficient for their suturing.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second suturing is common, that you gather the ends of four: the ends of the skin, two, and the ends of the stitching thread, two, or in place of one, with an awl containing equal thread in delicacy and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you pierce with the awl these four ends, withdraw the awl from the side where it entered, so that the thread tied above the wound falls; so that the suturing will be like that of cloth when they are sewn together, and place between every suture a quantity equal to the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture, I sewed up the wound of my man which had occurred within his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm: and out had come from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a rupture in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore returned it (the protruding organ) after the intestine of his had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound had healed in the space which was about fifteen days: and I cured him, and he recovered: and he lived after that for many years, turned back to his duties.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians judged that it would not heal (get better).
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put on the wound old dough twice a day, and attended to its cleansing with water of honey, until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I shall now speak of two kinds of sutures according to the narrative of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it begins with a sharp suture: and you insert the point from outside to inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the point penetrates the skin, and along its length and width throughout the whole body: release the end of the suture at the side where you inserted the point, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outside at the opposite extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same extremity from outside to inside: and release the end of the suture at the side where you are inserting the point, and make the point penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outside, and make it penetrate with your penetration as you do it, until it penetrates completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from the same side, and extract the point itself with its extremity, which is from the back on the other side, and pull out the tip that penetrated through the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then bring it back into the same skin, and extract its extremity from the other side with this extremity (the point), and pull it out from the skin on that side, and do it this way once, and then the other, alternating: and do it this way after the other, until you have extracted all of it according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The sum of this suture is that your sutures for the skin should be smaller than the skin itself: in such a way that you sew the points (the knots) of one side of the skin with one part of the extremity of the skin: and that you release it with the other part on the other side, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second species (type) of suture proper, as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This discourse is told to you as it is done by some healers in the way that they gather all parts fitting each other according to nature: and apply the point of one side of the skin to the other side's point, and the point of the back (mirach) to the other side's point.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You must make the tip of the back (mirach) stick out at the extremity of the skin close to you on the outside, and let it penetrate only to the inside there: and release both points (extremities) of the skin.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the tip, and let it penetrate from the outside to the inside into both points (extremities) of the skin, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both, and let both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the opposite points (tips) of the back (mirach), which are on the other side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 This method of stitching is better than common stitching and is a stitch which recalls remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 Thus is the speech of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And they said thus:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitch of the abdomen is straightened with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 The thread is introduced into each of them (the abdominal wounds) with one filament: and begin with the introduction of the hook from the part which is with you, and make it pass evenly along the skin stitches.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then the stitching of this (rupture) is more difficult than the rest of the places in the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the treatment of the wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 The fact is that when you come upon a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes by the air: and if you bring out the intestine, and wash it, and make it fit: then place it on powder of burnt flesh (or incarnate).
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already altered the wound: then place some ointments on it which are present with you, until they make pus; and let threads fall (on the wound) and be pressed down with mullein leaves and myrrh.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat that as the treatment of other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medications present with you, then immediately place on it that which begins to emit pus, old cottons; and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need another medication for the most part when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound may communicate to the main members in the injury, then it is necessary for you to immerse a soft wool in oil of temperate warmth or rose oil: and place it in the region around the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain or punctures, or rottenness in its own intestines (for this often happens), then clisterize him with warm wine of pitch, black: particularly if the rot has already reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating to the depths of its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from the small intestines is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine called Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and their size, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If however what comes from the wound is yellowish and you seize it fresh: bring it back according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If however it has passed a space, and is already greenish or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which has darkened from it, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in yellowish there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament and place two ends of the thread hanging from below on the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to alleviate its attraction towards you, and the extraction of the yellowish at the site of the wound, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Memory of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound: and a fistula was made, and it exuded purulent discharge.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore left the treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; neither did I cease to probe it, until it was healed, and the place had been consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 When I saw the place already consolidated, I feared an accident happening to the sick person in his belly; and no such accident happened to him from it.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better dispositions of himself, eating and drinking, urinating, and bathed, and exercised in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some experimenters said that when an injury happens in the Intestine and is small, then it should be tied according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And there is a way for you to capture ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When its head is on them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick to them and cannot be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one and do not stop doing that until the ant matches the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then return it [the ant] to its place, and close the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached to the Intestine until it is eaten away and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible to tie the Intestine even with a fine thread; which has been taken out from the animal's Intestine and attached after it has been introduced into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And there is a way to capture the end of this thread from the Intestine, and it should be scraped a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert the thread into the point and close the Intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to a dissection.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of suturing with worms and intestines, is not except by way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large wound, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines, then there is no skill except refinement, and its healing is not possible at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on the care of the bladder, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or boil when it becomes old and decrepit, turns into an ulcer, does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and is not cut off: then it is called universally in whatever member it is, Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And Fistula indeed is a hard, white knot filtered, without pain, which has the hollow of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risa, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And there are some hours when it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture is cut off at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is much and it is little; and it is thick and it is refined.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned in division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh is born in it, it is not this for any one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 Of which one is either due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or because it is malicious; or because there is hard flesh between it and its surrounding area preventing the growth of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inconvenient for its cure; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of illnesses is difficult and healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or the number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 I have already shown you all those causes and their signs, as well as the treatments for them with medicines in division. Here it is necessary that I make you know the treatment for Fistula and Strangulated Hernia, which is made through the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know then, that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For these are the fistulas that reach to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or ligaments; or intestines, or bladder, or some of the ribs; or some of the vertebrae in the back, or some of the joints; such as hands, and feet: and these are those that approach the proximity of the main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Which of these fistulas is according to this manner, is according to difficult healing and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If there is any fistula of which the depth does not reach to the places I have said: and you hope, and trust in its treatment, and wish to reach the knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or copper, if the fistula points in the straight direction, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin probe of lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since lead, with its softness, is easily worn away and bent around twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Cleanse then one opening from among its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you cleanse it, goes towards the other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then examine and investigate according to the way that is possible for you: so that you may know if there is a bone or nerve, and the fistula's concavity is deep or near; or it is a single fistula with many openings, and stands over all of it, with the strength of your own questioning, by which you question the weak, and inquiring pain under pressure with your hand on the place, and similar signs and incidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you stand over all these matters in a true position, then proceed to treatment with confidence. It is necessary for you at this time to consider whether it is a Fistula that appears near [the affected area], or in a safe distant place away from the junction, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I told you about: then cut the Fistula according to what has been mentioned in my account, and remove whatever is inside it through filtration, and the corruption of flesh that grows in its opening, or pus, and similar things. Care for [the area] until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the Fistula is deep, and it is straight: then it should be cut as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse [the area] from all corrupted flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer a linen cloth wrapped in sharp medicines and insert it into the concavity of the Fistula that you have seized with iron: do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the Fistula due to corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore [the area] with unguents that promote healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal through this, then cauterize [the area] as we have mentioned before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is bone and it has been confirmed for you: then ask about it, and cut the bone according to what I told you. If nothing prevents you from doing so in a vein, or nerve, or major limb, as we have said before.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption or blackening in it: then scrape it until the corruption is completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for [the bone] with that which promotes healing until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it was doing: then you know that you have not reached complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Excise therefore over it again, and inquire about its reason and cleanse it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You therefore do not have skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the corrupted bone is small and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that fit to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then inquire about their removal one by one, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If it happens to you that something prevents you from any of the humidities and there is no fear or mistake in making an incision of them: then incise those humidities and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you do not have the preparation for removing bones from your time, then place on the wound what causes it to rot itself and leave it until it rots what is around those bones from the flesh and humidities.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And tighten the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on it, if you are afraid, hot cottons soaked in ground sulfur with oil; or hot cottons soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those (humidities) rot certainly and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them is alleviated, and their drawing out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If a single large bone, such as the bone of the leg or hipbone, and similar to them, has been corrupted, and what is from it is a large part: then shave it with the final rasp until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it must be sawn and cut through entirely until the point where corruption stops: then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you a case that occurs to a man in his leg: place it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about thirty years of age, who had pain in his leg, from a cause that moved upon him within the body, that is, from inside, until the matter reached the leg, and an abscess was made by an abscess, and it was not an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Then passed the time with him while the error of physicians occurred, until the abscess was opened, and many substances gathered with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and moisture of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Then a multitude of physicians cared for him about two years and there was no wise man in the art of hand in it until I was called upon, and saw his leg and the substances that were flowing from those openings at a large pace: even all the body of the man was already swollen, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found them to reach one another from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I therefore made an incision over one of the openings, until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupt: which was already rotten, decayed, putrefied, perforated, until it had penetrated up to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I therefore cut out what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I removed, that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I have already uprooted it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed a dressing on the wound with consolidating medicines for a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again, and exposed over the bone second above the first opening; and found a continuous corruption with the bone: and cut away what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted to dress it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not dressed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore I exposed again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and attempt to dress it; and it was not dressed, until I cut from the bone about one palm's breadth, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I dressed it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition was not necessary in the operation of his and the section of his, except for the disposition of his weakness, and the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear over him of death; since it happened to him at all hours from an excess of evacuations with bad fainting spells.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore he was completely healed; and there grew strong flesh on the site of the bone, and good arrangements were made in his body, and his strength returned; and he turned to his own dispositions; and he did no harm at all to him in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If the prominent bone in the body is already fractured, then it is necessary that you grasp it in this manner: and it is as follows: to take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone; and command someone to stretch it upwards; and place another thicker ligament from wool on the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it to the flesh that surrounds the bone; extend its end so you can pull the flesh towards the lower parts; and you shall peel back the flesh over the place where you want to cut, so it doesn't get cut by the saw.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a wooden board or a table underneath the bone below; because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary that the saw be slightly above the corrupted place, so that corruption is not in the concavity of the bone; and it should not appear to the senses in its view, and make another part serve as a substitute for the sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, but rather continuous with another part, and corruption is in the middle or some part of it; then peel back the flesh from all its parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a wooden board underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw it from the first part where the corruption is, until the sawing is completed on the other side; and let the saw be slightly above the corruption, as we said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it joins from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 If, however, the corruption is between two joints, then there is no remedy but abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is at the beak of the hand or foot, then it presents a very difficult situation.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Nevertheless, you must find out what the nature of the corruption looks like to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And file (or grind) her and clean her as well as possible for you, and when it is corrected by any means, it does not cause opposition to the Vein or Nerve for you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many cutting (instruments) and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their thinness, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that the tool should be suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you according to the type of instrument that you need when your study is lengthy.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a sign of the modes of diseases; then you will find for yourself what suits it from the instruments for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples on which you cut, and the test by which you try it on others.
Forma Serrae.	 The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw (alternative).
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw (alternative).
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This image of the saw should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make the upper part of its arch, its sharpness from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and it should be made conically (or pyramidal).
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The form of a rasp for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this rasp be shaped like the head of a star-headed nail; and its points should be shaped according to the form of the points of a file.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it does not suit unless it is rubbed with it when the heads of the joints are broken, or if a large and thick bone is present.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of a medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of a razor with a concavity (convexity).
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of another razor with a curved tip.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of a small, fine, bent razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of a razor for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the form of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a drill and its tip is similar to a saw: it is used at many places due to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The form of a razor that fits for the purpose of cutting through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its tip is triangular and its angles are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And likewise it is necessary that all those things which I have said be made of razors, and chisels, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Section on the incising of extremities, and serration (cutting) of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Extremities become rotten either due to external causes or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Since you have treated the corruption with medication and it does not help, and you see that the corruption is spreading in a limb that nothing seems to affect: then it is necessary that you incise (cut) the limb up until where the corruption ends, so that the weakened part may escape death or the greater evil which is a defect of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign for this is that the limb darkens (becomes black) until it seems to be dead; or the heat has burned it, or it becomes rotten after turning black: until the rot is cut through up until where it follows the limb and creeps throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore when you make the incision and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures such as marine scorpions, weasels, hedgehogs, and similar animals.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If therefore corruption or injury is at the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave space for corruption to spread, until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and do not leave space for corruption to spread, until it reaches the arm's bone.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades it (the bone), then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If however corruption passes beyond (the arm) and you see it about the elbow: then there is the death of a weak man.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And over that (the dead arm), administration of remedy is its amount of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints: and if it reaches the heel of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 And if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it except to let it go and abandon the weak man to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting a member or sewing it is that you tighten the tendon below where you wish to cut, and tighten another tendon above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And stretch one of the tendons downwards, and stretch another tendon upwards towards the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two tendons with a broad knife until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth over all parts and not let the knife touch any healthy part; and an additional injury occurs to the weak man, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If however internal bleeding occurs while you are working on it, then quickly cauterize the place; or put some absorbing powders over it to stop the blood flow.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing happening to him as I told you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 This is what happened to him, because his foot turned black due to a burn similar to fire burning it; the decay started with his toe and eventually spread throughout the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, the man cut himself off from himself when he saw the decay spreading through his limb with great pain and burns; he cut himself at the joint, and healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time passed, the same decay occurred in the tip of his thumb on his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore, he came to me and I tried to regain the loss with the remedy that I placed on his hand after cleansing his body; however, the loss did not stop, instead it spread to another finger, until decay started affecting his entire hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 Therefore he called for me to cut off his hand; but I refused, hoping to cure the loss; and I also feared death for him during the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man was above his loss.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 And since he had given up on me, he returned to his own land; and then he came back to me because he was afraid of dying and cut off his entire hand; and he healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring this narrative except as an aid for that which falls under the genus of this illness; and to show what is signified by it, and according to how it should be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 [Title] On caring for bladder stones and the quality of enema with medications.
Caput XC.	 Head 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a boil occurs in some fleshy parts and the space of the boil extends until it makes collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated and what is in it comes out as pus, and there remains an empty place like a vessel: and the skin that is above it has become thin like a cloth that has already been softened: and it does not reach the final corruption nor presses on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called Sinus: and it is not called Fistula: however, if the space of it extends until corruption presses into one of these parts, then it is called Fistula, or ulcer.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And the care of this [fistula or sinus] is that you cut the entire skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has become thin like a cloth: and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you hope that the skin will adhere and the ultimate corruption does not follow from this: and if there is a thickness in the skin due to flesh, then treat it with Clisterium: and it is to be considered as a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then clisterize it with a medicine from Egypt, which is vinegar, oil, and zinziber, parts receiving equal amounts, mixed together in a vessel: and boil it over fire, until the medicine turns red: and let it become thick like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it whatever is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the sinus with it: and tie up its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it by pressing: do this for days until the sinus is purified and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And at times, one cleanses with water and ashes when this medicine is not present to you; and it is to be known that you receive the ashes of vinewood or ashes from holm oaks; and you throw water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then wash her, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the sinus is already cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient cannot bear Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then cleanse him with water and honey, to which something from crushed wine lees has already been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or cleanse him with honey and wine mixed together, because the property of honey is to purify and cleanse; and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do that several times and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has been removed, then cleanse him with it which causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is to be known that you receive from the plaster diaphanicon; and you dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or cleanse him with certain medicines and other unguents whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the sinus is narrow and cannot take a cannula for cleansing; then expand it slightly with iron; or place linen wound around an Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside it until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring together the edges with a suture; and allow the quantity of cleansing solution to enter it without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above; then cut it in a lower place within it so that the pus runs out below; because pus when obstructed in the depth of the sinus prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the bladder lower than you wish: then try, so that you prepare the member with a preparation by which pus runs out from it easily according to your preparation.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything from pus within it: and take the consolidating medicines that are placed upon the sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such quantity that there may be communication throughout the bladder.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors directly into the bladder opening, larger than the bladder opening by a little bit.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread ointments gently over another cloth, according to the size of the opening: and place it on top, at a distance from the bladder opening, in order to promote the outflow of pus from it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days, one by one.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 He who is on top of the bladder opening, he is the one you remove at every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and know that, whether what flows out from it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this, again consider the place of the bladder itself, whether its master feels pain there or not, and whether there is an abscess there or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your medicine is thus applied and you see the material that flows out from the bladder opening, then know that the bladder has already adhered or approaches adhesion: then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If pus flows out from the bladder after a long time with a subtle smell, then do not despair of its adhesion, for healing is approaching, since there are some people who slow down the regeneration of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however it comes out from the Sinus for many days as a putrid boil, then you shall know that the sinus is not adhered.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If the adhering sinus delays and its matter prolongs, then you shall add humid medicines with dry properties to it, as the doctors do; but they should be medicines that are moist in substance and dry in power, like dyafinicon ointment, when superfluous addition is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the last [part] that is treated, it is that you shall receive dyafinicon ointment, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and rub over it aged wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it with that and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now make one similar to this action, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment at hand, honey; when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum; grind the whole thing and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then lay a cloth over it and bind it to the sinus; and anoint with the honey you boiled until thickened, and powder its shape, and place it over the cloth and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes administered to him is long aristolochia, and the roots of celestial lily, and it is lily; and wheat flour, and knotgrass.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them singly or combined, grind them and sift the powder; and sprinkle it over the honey I told you about, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the matter of the sinus prolongs and does not heal with this treatment, then you shall know that there is corruption in its depth; or it has already made an impression on the bones or hard members or ligaments; then treat it with fistula cure, as mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 On the treatment of Panaritis and a worn nail, and the incision of a finger, and a section.
Caput XCI.	 De Curatione Ulceris et Erysipelatis,
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Aposteme which occurs under the nail of the thumb or big toe of the hand or foot; perhaps it also arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the matter of this (Panaritis) is prolonged and neglected, it becomes an aposteme that is treated with heat; it may rot and discharge pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; perhaps it rots completely, and the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul smell; and the end of the finger becomes wide and darkens.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it (the affected part), and your treatment does not improve it: then it is necessary to cut with the iron the entire excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail also is healthy, and the hollow additions of the nail already press the flesh towards the inside and begin to pierce it and harm it: then it is necessary that you place subtle radium under the corner of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh easily, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines burning, corrosive ones, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If the corruption already presses on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it; for a corrupted bone never heals while it remains in there.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see corrosion and corruption advancing on the finger, then cut it at one joint, according to what was previously mentioned about its memory (anatomy).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If there is wear or injury of the nail, and a violent pain occurs in it: then it is necessary to use leeches first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula cut crosswise from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And keep, so that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause a very violent pain to occur above it, and it will be a cause for the growth of additional flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then heal the place with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 A finger which is born in some human hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the joint of the root, or its birthplace is in some joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 He who is born in certain knots of the finger, is not moved; and he who is born near the junction of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The flesh that grows from them is easily divided.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 It should be cut at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the treatment of one born at the junction of the root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 However, in the one born on the finger at the end of the knots, then it is necessary to cut its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 The consolidation that happens between the fingers occurs frequently either from human birth, that is, being born with it, or from a wound consolidation, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut the consolidated part until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place a cloth or linen soaked in rose oil between them to prevent them from consolidating quickly and separate them; or place a thin lead plate between them until the location is healed as needed.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation happens with some fingers at the palm, then cut the consolidated part as needed and conform to the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on the defect in incisions.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 The veins are twisted, thick, full of melancholic excesses that occur in various parts of the body; and most frequently they occur in the legs, especially those who travel and work hard, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 It is necessary that you administer the lancing of the body from black choler several times by a strong lancing.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then, phlebotomy (bloodletting) of the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The treatment (of these things) with iron (lancet), is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One method is to score it (the affected area) and to draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And another method is to elevate the Vein and extract it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The incision of this [vein] is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Irrigate the leg first with much hot water until the thick, foul blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of the hip of that [leg], up to the lower part of the thigh with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then lift (eleua), that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg towards the upper part, and it should first be done by the leech for the weak [patient].
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail with what is below it (down to its base): until the quantity of blood that you see is sufficient, and what strength the weak [patient] can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then bind (it), and command him to abstain from foods that cause black bile; and repeat the evacuation and leeching when the veins are full, for it may harm the weak [patient].
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The lifting (eleuatio) of this [vein] is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Scrape the weak leg if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it [the leg] in a bath, or irrigate it in the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise it with strong movements if there is no bath present for him, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make an incision along the direction of the vein in length: or at the end [of the vein] near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with the scalpel and scrape off the vein from all sides until it is felt: and at its appearance, it will turn from red to blackish-blue.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes from the skin, it appears white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert the Radium under it until it is raised and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then peel the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it up with the radii as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another section or several sections if necessary for that one.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then peel it and cut the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract from the section above that one.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 Do this until you extract it from the upper or highest section, or all sections until it comes out completely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to be extracted and lifted; then insert a lancet with a strong thread twice, tie it and extract it yourself or insert the radii under it and turn your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will become very difficult for you to lift it up and it may enter into the wound from that causing harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have extracted it completely; then place a linen cloth soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil over the wound site and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is contracted having a winding with coiling to parts and it is not as we said according to the straightness; then you should make an incision over all its winding parts and the sites of its coiling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it up completely; and be careful at your incision site not to cut the vein or wound; for it will become very difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The method by which a vine is healed (or treated).
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The shape of the blind man's (catheter) cup.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not narrow like other catheters nor has a sharp tip that would injure the vein; rather it is rounded and flexible because if it were too fine, it would pierce the vein with its fineness; on the contrary, it should have excess roundness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of a leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs of warm lands, such as Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry, warm lands of little softness, that is, where no plant or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is also generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, such as happens within snake and ascaris worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is a violent inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the area is blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to come out from that blistered area, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal. This is followed by a series of further instructions on how to safely extract the vein, including using hot irons and cauterizing the surrounding tissue. The translation ends
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears, then wrap a piece of lead weighing one keil dram around it, up to two and a half drams; and let the suspended lead hang from the leg. This is part of instructions on how to safely extract the vein by wrapping it with lead to prevent it from collapsing or breaking during the extraction process.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it towards the exterior, wrap it in lead and tie it up. This instruction is likely meant to prevent infection during the extraction process by keeping the vein covered and contained. The translation ends here.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends too much, then cut off that part and turn up the remaining part.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not cut it at the root before it has emerged completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh; it causes an abscess to appear, and pus at the site, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and drawn out slowly until it has emerged entirely from its end, and nothing is left in the body from it: and this vein emerges from some humans that is as long as five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because it has emerged from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment time: then insert a ray into its opening and pierce it with a long hole along with the body until everything that is in it from matter has been evacuated; and administer the rotting of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then cure it with treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 This vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and holes occur in it, and a branch comes out from every hole.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, take care of it as we said in the division, and with what was mentioned earlier.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Section on worms generated under the skin, and this is called Bouina's disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouina's disease in a certain land among us; because it often occurs in cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it travels through the body, moving up and down; and it is detected by the senses during walking of a limb to another, until it bursts anywhere that it bursts on the skin, and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the corruption of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As it happens with worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And feared from its malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves in the body and is raised to the head and reaches the place: then perhaps it opens there, and goes out, and destroys the eye; and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, in order to cure it and remove it, this is not done except during its movement, and the perception of it by the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one should tighten what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and remove it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a cautery over the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And what is feared more, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then tighten under it with a good ligature above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick person should use cleanliness of his body, with medicines dissolving corrupting bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him avoid foods that cause corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on the incision for the disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called in our land Nakir; it is a pain that occurs in certain members, and then changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have seen this, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she extended her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And when an hour had passed, I saw a swelling move with a rod, as a worm moves, quickly ascending to the man's shoulder: it was like living silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore, pain left that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 After an hour it ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was rotating throughout its entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, I was amazed at the swiftness of the change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had never seen this sickness appear to my eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However, I saw many who found the pain change from limb to limb; and I did not see it with my own eyes as I did in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than the fact that she was from those who are dry of body vessels; hence, this appears to indicate a windiness changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear in those who are sweet-smelling and moist bodies of concealed veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain; then if it is apparent to you, as we said, then press on it quickly and below it; cut above it until that windiness pressed out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes; then cure it by expelling the body and that which expels windiness; and crush them with foul pills and pills of myrrh and similar substances.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Head LXVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are differentiated according to their types and the places where they fall on the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 However, the diversity of ears is as follows: because among them are those with large tips and small ones; and concave ones, and those without openings.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those with three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those with tongues (projectile points).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those with stars (points with multiple prongs).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 But those which fall on the limbs, are according to two types.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or the limbs are hollow, like the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When therefore it falls in one of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you devote extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 From the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates a bone, and exits above the brain, are: since sudden headaches occur from this, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood comes out from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And moisture comes out from the wound's place, white like plaster.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out of it resembling a meaty fluid.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out by itself.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls on the heart are: that it is close to the left nipple, and one feels as if it were fixed in a hard object, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to a pulse movement, and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And it follows that coldness of the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting occur.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore, that death is descending without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels that follow the neck are to be cut off, and the color of the sick is to be changed.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it exhales a large, deep breath and seeks attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If an arrow falls into the lung, which is in the chest; then it is near to small ribs: and a great panting with intense pain, with sigh, occurs; and all limbs of shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out through the wound from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if an arrow falls into the abdomen and pierces it: something of feces comes out through the wound, or pus, or an intestine that is already ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope for his cure, nor for the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If an arrow falls into the bladder and passes urine: and something passes out from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the sick; then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 Remaining members, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, aid, dorsal spine, fork, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved according to several arrangements: when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve; and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, to indicate to you by that on your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a man had an arrow fall into his eye socket near the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I removed it myself from the other side, under the cheek of his ear; and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 I also removed another arrow from a Jew that had fallen on his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not get hold of it except for its small end, with which it adhered to its wood; and the arrow was large among arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jew has been healed, and no accidental evil has happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arabic, and it belonged to those with ears [i.e., humans].
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 So I cut through him on top of two windpipes; and by now he was drowned within his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I was sharpened with that [instrument], until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen into his abdomen; and we thought he would die because of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow; I sharpened myself upon it and extracted it; and he was healed, and no accidental evil happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man who had an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years it came out [of the body] from the root of his hipbone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I saw a woman who had an arrow lodged in her abdomen, and the wound was healed over it; but the arrow remained within her, and nothing changed in her condition or caused her any harm in her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man who had an arrow lodged in his face; the wound healed over it, and there was little pain for him; and similar things happened to many others.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 I extracted an arrow from a nobleman of the King who had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already deviated slightly towards the right; but the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was called to treat him after the fall of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found therefore a wound of an arrow very tightly closed.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I probed it with delicate tweezers and did not feel it: and himself he found a puncture and pain on his right side of the ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I hoped therefore that it was this puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I applied a plaster to the place with a drawing ointment having an attracting and dissolving property, trusting that the spot would open and show me the sign of the arrow so that I might cut above it: and it did not happen at the place where it should have happened, showing that the arrow had passed through.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I stayed with the plaster over him for many days: and it did not happen as expected, and the wound hardened in the meantime: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of many days, until he felt the arrow one day within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I placed over the wound medicine that was sharp and corrosive for many days until it opened: and when I probed it with delicate tweezers, I felt the fine tip of the arrow sticking to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added to the opening of the wound with this sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared clearly to us: and it passed me with that space of time about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then when the wound had swollen and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, it did not obey to come out: then I did not stop probing, and devising on it with means of ingenuity, until I began one day with correctly made forceps according to the form that they will take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And physicians indeed judge, that the nasal cartilage does not restore.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered with complete health; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extraction of some arrows: that you may place that rule and meaning on what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does that book contain it, and a wise craftsman compares little with much; and with what is present, concerning what is absent; and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place from whence it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or in reverse direction of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which goes out from whence it entered is an arrow proceeding into a soft place; and it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey for an exit from the hour at which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it rots away; and the attraction of it will cease, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it strikes a bone, and does not obey you for an exit, then leave it also for some days; and move it with attraction and motion every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey you for an exit after days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrow in the bone on every side with a subtle chisel until the arrows swell.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then attract it and draw out the arrow.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and it has already advanced into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms which I said appear weak: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and leave it until it is balanced in its existence for days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 If an arrow reaches the sifach (shinbone), then it does not prolong death.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 If the arrow is not fixed except within the body of a bone but does not reach the shinbone and it remains weak for some days without any other incident happening, then skill is used in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed firmly and does not obey you when trying to attract it, then apply the iron gouge around the arrow as I have told you; afterwards take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already hidden within the body and concealed from sensation, then search for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it (the arrow), then attract it using certain instruments suitable for the task.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot reach the arrow due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow being deep; and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in that area: then pierce it (the arrow) and wait for the wound to expand so that it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears that hold the arrow fast on all sides: then free the fixed flesh from them by any means you can; and if you cannot lift the flesh due to a fracture of the ears or twisting of them, wait until it breaks out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any location, then use the twisting of your hand with pliers for all parts; until it breaks out: and with great subtlety to avoid breaking the arrow, making its attraction difficult and the extraction itself.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot reach it (the arrow) for an hour: then leave it for some days until the things around it rot away.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then probe it again; for the wound will close itself, but if it causes blood flow contrary to you: then administer what I have said in its treatment in its chapter; and protect your strength from cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer your art in every way possible to the removal of an arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness or firmness as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, it should be weakened according to the form (shape) by which it was lodged inside (the wound).
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more helpful (for the patient's recovery).
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to shapes (arrowheads or arrows of different types).
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that comes out from the opposite side of the other part or has already proceeded outwards, or makes a hump at the end of the arrow by a sensation on the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it protruding: therefore, cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out: for it becomes easy to come out by itself.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If however it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow presses against the bone and widens itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if it does not (come out): let it be for some days; then try again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the shaft of the arrow is in it (the wound), then push it out with the shaft.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If however the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to administer a push: then insert an instrument with a hollow (concave) end into it so that it enters the concavity of the arrowhead; then push it out with the same (instrument).
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is concave, then push it out with the instrument inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow will be loosened by that (method).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to excavate all the flesh in which the poison is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for her as is fitting until that point.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If an arrow is falling into the chest, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side: and it is near by what you touch with the probe, and it can be cut through it: then cut through it, and be careful not to cut a vein, or a nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then suture the wound, if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are pulled out.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should be shaped like a bird's beak, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made in many shapes: large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of the impeller is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of the impeller is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is a deaf end like a radius, so that its entrance into the concave arrowhead is relieved, and it is driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the concave impeller is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it is relieved and its thrust.

Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is, that the head of the sick person should be shaved: and the nape of his head should be rubbed in the place of two veins with a rough cloth rubbing good.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person should tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their places are behind the ears, in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 So seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsations under your finger, mark that place with the branding iron.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take a phlebotomy knife, and this is called the Incisor.

Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Then, cut it as you did with two other veins: and let out blood according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then, loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein at the hour position.

Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then dissolve the wound of the sick man and tie it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it opens with a wide phlebotomy.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, the phlebotomist should not be sharp-pointed as the other phlebotomists, rather it should be wide-mouthed.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the phlebotomy should be made across [the vein], since the bone is nearby; and perhaps the phlebotomist will break it when it is sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 On phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 [Section on nasal vein phlebotomy]
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose are phlebotomized to treat acute fever, and severe swelling, and diseases of the face, such as hemigraine and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that it tightens a weak neck [of a person].
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold the nose of that person with your left hand, and take a subtle, long lancet; and place it in the middle of the nasal cavity, between that which separates the nose according to its correct alignment.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that your hand be at the end with the lancet slightly; and make out as much blood as it is necessary for you.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it up at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it recovers quickly itself.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 [Section on phlebotomy of the veins in the back (of the head)]
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The phlebotomy of the two veins in the back (of the head) has two beneficial effects: it helps to constrict coughing and the beginning of leprosy, and diseases of melancholy, and impetigo, and bad ulcers, and those that are corroding, i.e., herpetic sores or eruptions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that it binds the sick person under each neck with a ligature; and the craftsman should stand over the head of the sick, and the sick person should be sitting on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then phlebotomy vein to the length of phlebotomy wide a little shorter.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out an appropriate amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then release the ligature and bind two veins together tightly: so that the sick person does not faint.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let it be until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 A wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the veins of Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The veins of Algeberich are helpful for phlebotomy because they contribute to alcohol in the mouth and corruption of gums, and ulcers, and fissures in lips, and ulcers, even those that are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that you should have the sick person sit before you: and bind his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip and look at two veins; one of which is on the right side of the lip, and the second on its left side: and the demonstration of each is evident through their blueness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And it is true that around them are small veins, black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore cut both with an incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt about you and you do not know which of them it is: then direct your attention to the larger incision, and that will be clearer.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with two veins that are in the upper lip; and it is most common to use this procedure: and cut the two veins in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 On phlebotomy: vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 For the two veins that are under the tongue, phlebotomy is beneficial: it is because cephalic phlebotomy is for conditions in the throat and sickness of the windpipe, and sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should be seated in front of you with his hand on the sun: and loosen his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein: and the color of both declines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore, phlebotomize each one: and be careful not to injure your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For under it are the arteries, and possibly there may be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 On three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, these are the ones for whose phlebotomy there is a custom among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy of them is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or pricking with a broad phlebotome made of myrtle: or letting it open to the subtle point of decline: or cutting with a sharp phlebotome, and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus, Alnesil is that which fits for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these there are wide and thin forms according to the width and tightness of the veins. The shape of the phlebotome made of myrtle should be wide, as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it fits for opening veins that are hollow, full, proceeding, appearing, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this phlebotome is of smaller width and more subtle in cutting.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It is appropriate for phlebotomy of subtle veins that contain delicate lemon-yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Book on Phlebotomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 Phlebotomy of the basilica is helpful for one of these three veins' phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it drains blood from ailments that are under the throat and neck, following the chest and abdomen; therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful with it, since an artery is beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If, however, the phlebotomist makes a mistake and adds in the puncture, he will cut the artery, and there will be blood flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, the phlebotomist should not puncture it; rather, it should be cut by Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you exchange it for another or seek one of its branches; or you replace it with the vein of the arm, the phlebotomist.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 It is itself obvious and cut it when Anesil the phlebotomist does so, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If, however, you wish to perform phlebotomy on this same one, then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, that you touch the place, until you recognize the pulsed place.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with a sign using hot wax, afterwards the arm; and cut the vein with a concave incision, the phlebotomist Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the puncture does not fall into the space from the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tighten the bandage, an inflammation at the place that you have marked with hot wax; then that inflammation is inflation of the artery; therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rise during phlebotomy, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red: then you will know that it is from the blood of an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then draw back and place your finger over the spot at a distance, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then bind the arm and let it be; let the weak one avoid moving it; and there should be fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for a few days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood does not flow off and binds you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and the blood flows off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree, cut it and take one half, bind it over the place where the vein is constricted with a string and bandages until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood flows off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if it does not: then care for it with the remembrance of that place from where powder is removed to cause blood flow, and removal of the blood from that vein is not difficult in many positions due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of the Blue Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The phlebotomy of the Blue Vein is helpful because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body; therefore, since it is composed of a branch of Basilica and a branch of Cephalica, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that it should be feared from its phlebotomy, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If a nerve is struck during phlebotomy puncture, and it causes fainting, the healing process becomes difficult, and perhaps it may not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve appears to sensation often.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is concealed in some individuals and is subtle and not evident: then you must place your lancet where that vein is, along with a small incision and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Chapter on the Vein of the Head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The assistance of phlebotomy for the Vein of the Head is because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is proper in this vein that if you wish, the lancet should be anointed with olive oil or myrtle oil before pricking, because it is safer than all the veins, since it is not near an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is suitable for you in phlebotomy that you avoid the head and arm only, and seek a more comfortable location: and it does no harm if it is not found at the first prick, but you may return to it several times with the lancet.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps an abscess may form in some individuals when it is not pricked at the first prick, but it does no harm to that abscess in any case.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the Usefulness of Phlebotomy and the Cautions Observed in It.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The nature and accidents of phlebotomy, which you must consider for its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and its persistence, and with caution to avoid illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And it shall be done venesection on one of the three veins that are on the elbow, namely, Cephalica, Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And it shall be done venesection at the beginning of Spring after fasting, in truth, and summer; in autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Venesection shall be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Venesection which is administered in diseases does not have a specific hour; but when the need and appropriateness for it arises, it can be done at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 It is not necessary to perform venesection on boys until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Venesection shall not be performed on pregnant women except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Venesection shall not be performed on the elderly who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 When someone wants to perform venesection for any reason, it is necessary to clean the intestines before venesection with a soft enema, if there is much fecal matter retained in them; so that during venesection, the veins are not attracted by putrid waste from the intestines harmful to the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Venesection shall not be performed on the patient who is intoxicated, that is, suffering from sickness of satiety or nausea; nor on one drunk or vomiting due to drunkenness until it has passed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Venesection shall not be performed on a patient with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 It should be avoided to perform venesection again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, multiplication of coitus, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, or anything that dissolves the strength from the body or an animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider in fineness of humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications: if it is possible for him to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter the bath, unless it is forbidden by something: or exercise in some way, so that blood may be made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place phlebotomy on his chest, on the third day, as we have said: and endeavor that his chest is evacuated of all evils that day: such as pain, anger, fear: and of all bodily ailments, such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him have present the things that are used in custom among men from their fragrance, and scent, and joy, and similar things, according to the quantity possible for him.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on a stool higher than the stool for phlebotomy: afterwards he will draw out his arm and rub it with his hand two or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then bind the ligature with a cord, and wind it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be moderated, because if the ligature is unequal or excessive in the ligature, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in softening, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after tying, it is necessary that the person being bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and are felt.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleans the puncture point with a little oil, an old one properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he shall place his index finger of the left hand on that vein at the place where he wants to make a puncture, slightly: so that the vein does not escape and the blow is not wasted.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because it is from the vein as you find it, similar to a fleeing cord, during phlebotomy; and from these there is what is full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotomy instrument upon it, it contracts under the phlebotomy instrument, and deceives the phlebotomator, and the phlebotomist does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is tightened: therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomator should be firm, and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Draw or incise the phlebotomy instrument away from the vein.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If the vein is opened by one cut, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then make another cut a little below or above the same place with haste; but if it is not possible to make another incision.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If it cannot be made another incision or the weak person faints, then leave him for a day, or two days; and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps the abscess will attract heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then make another incision if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or blood runs subtly, then be afraid that not enough blood will come out; then make another incision in the same hole according to the straight line, and add a little more in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this quickly before the abscess is removed, for the place of the abscess is in many people during small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see that the abscess has already been removed, then do not go over it at all, for it does not cleanse anything in your hands.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put something of olive oil over it, because it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better in this place than olive oil itself and other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil faeces in every phlebotomy of yours, where phlebotomies veins are against the prohibition of blood circulation; and they do this by Tyriac Albaharik, and sagzenea, when it is placed over one of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 Blood is made subtle and dissolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens in the place of phlebotomy a large abscess, for it often happens, especially to those who are not phlebotomists except at that time, or there is a small opening of vein; then hasten and put over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly; and tighten it for an hour, because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the blood leaves from that vein itself, when its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days of blackness or greenness, it does not hurt it; and if you wish, put over it something of aloe, or myrrh dissolved; or something from mint juice, that is, camphor or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 Often abscesses and protuberances happen at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Put then your hand over it; if you find softness under the pressure of your hand on it, then that protuberance is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful to put over it something from what I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from an artery flows out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster to it with what is there for the swelling, so that the place becomes hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary that you draw blood from every man according to the amount of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears due to a color prevailing over blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 If the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; similarly, if you see it thick, let it go until it becomes subtle; and similarly, if it is sharp, let it be removed until its sharpness disappears.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for him who is full, strong and in need of bloodletting with one vein to be amplified, and the bloodletter should be on the side; and it should be contrary for him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary that it be drawn from the veins and that there be a narrow opening; and it is better that which is administered in bloodletting through the vein be a cross-section rather than a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and from the cutting of nerves; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting through breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And to whom this is accustomed to come upon bloodletting syncope, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting with a little bread soaked in water of muscatel grapes or dried if heated; and draw out from his blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if it is of cold constitution, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of honey or scented honey with spices or aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If syncope occurs during bloodletting and the cause is the outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat water and subtle aromatic syrup; and use aromatics with algae and let his chest be wrapped with it; and use the rest that we said in division in the chapter on syncope through evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 Whoever wishes to amputate his arm and let out blood in the second [stage]: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for evacuation of much, and the strength of whose phlebotomy is weak, to let out blood gradually by the quantity of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 Whoever wants to amputate his arm and let out blood in the second [stage], and it is his body (i.e., he is doing it voluntarily): then he should do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 Whoever wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite part that it flows to: it is necessary for him that it be let out on the second day or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes a fever to come on: it is necessary for the blood to be let out in a single instance, and a large quantity drawn: and the opening should be widened until there occurs fainting: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and so that you place your hand upon his pulse near the flow of blood, so that death does not occur from the fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For often it happens when the phlebotomist is unaware, and falls through carelessness.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not necessary when you wish to amputate the arm and let out blood in the second [stage], if the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that you press on it violently and the area around it be quickly extended.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For this is very bad indeed, rather let it alone until the second [stage of] phlebotomy.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has coagulated from blood in the vein opening, and place something dissolved salt in water on top of it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 Place something made from turiyakh alfarokh or sagzena on top of it, and apply gentle pressure until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If the vein has already been cut, then leave it alone, and do not cover it, until the boil settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If it is necessary to let blood for any reason and there is no excuse, then either perform venesection at that location or in another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The arm should be bled at the location of Fuscus and Basilicus, since they are not found and are concealed because they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 The manner of venesection is as follows: the weak person should insert his hand into hot water until it turns red and the vein becomes visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then, a bandage with moderate constriction should be tied above it.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the venesection is to be done obliquely gradually, neither horizontally nor vertically; and let the incision be wide, and let your venesection be made over the joint of the hand a little.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the outflow of blood is forbidden, then immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you meet your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if it is during the summer days, then you are excused from immersing your hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 Above all, the flow of blood into hot water is recommended during wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 The venesection of this vein is healthier than all other veins because it is not a pulsating vein and there is no nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Venesection of the Saluatella in the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The manner of venesection is to tie a ligature around the thumb with a bandage or your hand, after you immerse it in hot water until the vein swells and becomes very sensitive.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make an incision across the vein (phlebotomy).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not harm her in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And keep, lest you amputate your hand while performing phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under that (skin) are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then return your hand to hot water and let the blood flow there.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not return your hand to hot water, the blood coagulates in the vein opening and it stops flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Since you will draw as much blood as needed, then place oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from coagulating quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary that you do this with each constricted vein.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the remedy for this phlebotomy is from the left hand, because it alleviates diseases of the spleen; and similarly do this for his phlebotomy as you did for the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The remedy for the saphenous vein phlebotomy is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body such as female diseases (menstrual problems), kidney diseases, old sores on hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of this phlebotomy is that an invalid should immerse his foot in hot water and make friction on it until the veins are full; then tie above the ankle with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The location of the vein is near the heel, visible towards the thumb; and it branches out from there into multiple veins on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, perform the phlebotomy on a larger branch of it or near the heel in its cluster; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If a phlebotomist performs it on the face of the foot, then be careful not to injure the nerves that are beneath the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Place your phlebotomy instrument across it, as if you wish to cut through it; let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the flow of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the vein of the phlebotomist strays in the first try, then he should repeat with the phlebotomy at a slightly higher location; for that spot is safe, and you need not fear harm from it, as long as you are careful around the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the sciatic vein is, as we have said, near the calcaneum on the side of the forest [of the foot].
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the remedy for this phlebotomy is to alleviate pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of this phlebotomy is that an unwell person should enter the bath and hasten; then bind his leg from the side of the ankle to above the calcaneum with a thin, long plaster; for it does not appear except for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then perform the phlebotomy as your skill allows, either with a cut or across; and it is better to make an incision or to sever [the vein] with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For that spot is safer, and the vein is hidden very deeply in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses; then perform a phlebotomy on one of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot and turns towards the ear; be careful around the nerves, and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then loosen the stricture, and place skin over the site of phlebotomy, and tie the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 Swiftly it heals.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Ventosection and its Quality of Use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter CXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are made from horns, copper, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Ventosection is indeed performed in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With incision and bloodletting; and the other is ventosection without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventosection which is without incision, is performed in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places of ventosection which are administered with incision and bloodletting are fourteen on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is Ventosection of Alnocrates, and it is the last on the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; ventosections of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates on the neck from both sides at once; ventosections of the brain, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; ventosections of two spatulas; ventosection of Alachosos above the tail end; ventosections of two foci, and they are in the middle of two arms; ventosections of two legs; ventosections of two knees.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And ventosection does not draw blood from small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its virtue does not fall out of them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary that ventosection be administered either with fire or without it in any disease caused by congestion until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity arises for ventosection due to disease or habit, it is administered at any hour during the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 That is, because there is one of men who, when multiplied within him the blood, until it needs drawing out through ventilation, finds in his head a swelling and sores.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And there is one of them who finds repletion and redness on his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And there is one of them who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And there is one of them who scratches the place of his ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And there is one of them whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And there is one of them who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or the tongue is spitted out and the blood is spat out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And there is one of them whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And there is one of them who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we therefore see something of these, and properly if it is in the third month: we command then ventilation to be made, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The remedy for ventilation of the neck is: because it brings about heaviness in the head, and what is expelled goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 But it should be that this is after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this ventilation is in place of a cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it should not be used by one who is of cold temperament, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 Because it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for that reason it should not be used by the elderly, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But he who does this frequently generates forgetfulness over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And therefore, you should instruct the Anesthetist to place his hand momentarily towards the lower part when letting go, fearing from forgetfulness due to generation.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Anesthesia or Alkehel, is in place of phlebotomy Fusca, and phlebotomy Basilica, and because of this it causes sneezing, constriction of breath, breathlessness of instruments, cough, and filling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It is necessary that the anesthetist Alkehel should be pushed momentarily, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 But anesthesia alhagdahim causes headaches, attacks, migraines, and perforation; and it is in place of phlebotomy Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you should instruct the anesthetist not to press his hand during scarification; so as not to cut the artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 But anesthesia below the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, decay of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it is instead of phlebotomy aleherich, which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 But anesthesia with spatulas causes toothache, which occurs from pressing and heating.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 But anesthesia of the internal parts of two kidneys causes help for phlebotomy of three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica; because it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw blood from larger veins until the attraction reaches to veins three.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you should instruct the anesthetist not to proceed too far during scarification; because the area is exposed with flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventosa that inflates over the alchausos is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And it is necessary to advise the Ventosator that the ventosa should be large and made of air: since the place requires strong suction and perhaps fine ventoses may break; and let it be cut with a deep incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The ventoses of the legs diminish by a manifest reduction: since they draw blood from the whole body and they contribute to ancient pains in kidneys, womb, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and contribute to bloating and dropsy; and they are in place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body much, and cause fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the help of the ventoses for alhorcobeni is near the help of the ventoses of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning of the ventoses is that you should place the ventosa first in an empty place and perform a moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the ventoses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place at equal speed: and do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the place already redden and inflame, and the redness appears to be blood; then scarify, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For if a man is of soft flesh and few pores, it is necessary to scarify him only once, not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And advise the Ventosator to expand the scarification and make it shallow; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is a swelling in the blood, then it is necessary to lance it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first instance, an opening is made for the subtlety of the blood and its thinning; in the second instance, a thorough examination is made for the extraction of the thickened blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If the blood is very impure, then lancing should be done a third time: to achieve the final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually or in small amounts, a single lancing is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to make multiple extractions of the blood, we should perform multiple lancings.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to perform a deep lancing; and the depth of the lancing, equal to the end, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 [Paragraph] What should be administered from the oils when in the position of the Ventosas (Venetians), and what one should avoid with the Ventosando.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it should be anointed with the Ventosas places using open, soothing, resolving oils: if it is during the summer season, as alkali oil, or olive oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or cucumber seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sulphur: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is excessive fat that is cold, then use oil of amaracus, or oil of balm of Gilead, or oil of almond, or oil of dittany: and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If there is a windy discharge of large pores, soft flesh: then it should be prohibited from using oil, and the places of the windings should be washed with rose water, or cold water, or salt water, or water of squash, or water of purslane: and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 But for him whose blood is abundant with moisture, wash the windings with vinegar, or water of myrtle, and sumac: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For him whose excesses are thick, wash the windings with old wine, or sage water, or anise decoction, or chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it should be careful not to wash the windings in a bath, or in the foot of a bath, but rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not good if anyone sleeps after washing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What should be used to control the windy discharge, or the blood-letter before washing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, it should be considered first: if the patient is windy or blood-let, and his acuity and inflammation are choleric: then it should be given cooling things, such as grapes juice: also a bladder with vinegar and lettuce, and roasted onions, and yolk: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 Place his food before the chickens, and cook the mutton pieces, and set prepared food with herbs: and similar things for them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 If it is a cold complexion, let him drink syrup made from honey, or from almiua, or ale made from seeds; and let him drink moderately strong wine, which is between old and new; and let it be prescribed that he should eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food before the chickens and dogs; and let him have small birds, that is, little birds; and let the pigeon chicks be crushed.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of venesection and bloodletting should be more than food; and it must be given in certain men at hours tyriaca or alfaroch, or a medicine made from musk (muscata), or ale of elderberry (alesselithe) before venesection; and before or after: to strengthen the main limbs, and to make the blood subtile.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary that they should drink it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on venesection without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Venesections without scarification are those which are applied on the liver, spleen, foot-affliction, and on the abdomen, umbilicus, places of kidneys, and on the ankle; because these limbs cannot endure scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And by these there is no search for anything, except that it draws blood from one limb to another; as we place the venesection on the breasts in the affliction of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve the venosity of an unwanted cold in a limb; as we place the venesection on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the limb rarefied, warms it up, and removes pain for this reason; because it has dissolved that venosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also, it is placed on the kidney when there occurs an ulceration or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By virtue of its attracting power, perhaps it opens the ulcer, or expels the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 Similarly, when it is placed on the liver and spleen for the treatment of windiness in both cases.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These are administered empty with a mere incision only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered with warm water in cases of pleurisy: this is to fill the Ventosa and make it large, only with warm water, or water in which certain suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of the Ventosa administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The diameter of its opening should be two fingers apart, as we have made it; and the depth should be half the size of a palm; and on its side there should be a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into it with an awl; it should be made of copper, tin, leather, or linen, equal thickness, cleansed; so as not to harm the body during its placement upon it; and in its middle there should be a crossbar transverse from copper or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now it becomes this swollen one large, greater than we said before, and yet not much smaller than that (swelling), according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 Swellings in children are different from swellings in men, and those of larger bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this swollen one with fire on a limb is to ignite linen with fire from flax or a small candle from wax: and place it on the middle of the crossbar which is in the middle of the swelling: so that the fire may be kindled below the swelling, not to burn the body of the weak one.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is to be placed on a limb, and the finger shall be on the hole which I said, as long as we hold the swelling: when we need it, we remove the finger, and the vapor comes out through that hole, and the swelling is immediately relieved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then linen with fire according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In the swelling administered for the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar nor hole: it is not administered unless it is filled with water and placed on a limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this swelling, the larger it is, so as to hold more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sanguisugums.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX (99).
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sanguisugae are not administered in many places except where the position of swellings is not possible due to their smallness, such as the lips, gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or in a bare member, such as fingers or nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is that you come from Sanguisugis which are in sweet waters, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be let for day and night in sweet water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 The body is first evacuated with venesection, and with emetics.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then the sick limb should be washed until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 They are then placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with a syringe, then it is more helpful; if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then it should be washed with much water, rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood is prolonged after bleeding from leeches, and it becomes draining; then soak a linen cloth in cold water, place it on top, until the drainage stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there is an increase in blood, then sprinkle on it powdered alum, gall nuts, and similar things from the poppy; until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or pieces of stripped beans can be placed on the place; and they are left until the beans stick to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if leeches need to be repeated, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If leeches are forbidden from being hung up, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or stick a needle into the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they are placed, for when they feel something from the blood, they will stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall, sprinkle something from powdered aloes, salt, or ashes over them; and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 § Discourse on the restoration, displacement, and treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	 Title I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture, and dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O sons, that many foolish doctors and the ignorant boast of this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book nor read from it a letter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason it happens that this method is lacking among the skilled [people] in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have not encountered it [the method] at all in good form, and I have not obtained it from it anything except what I obtained due to the length of reading ancient books and diligence over understanding them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I adhered by experience and diligent study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 Now I have described to you from that [method] in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and beyond what my experience has exceeded, after I have abbreviated it for you, and have freed it from the occupation of abbreviation, and have abbreviated it at the point of abbreviation, and have shown it at the point of declination: and I have formed many shapes from the forms of the instruments that are used in it, since it is by addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In summary, and collections concerning the existence of bone fractures, from those whose preliminary [examination] is necessary before we begin the recovery of fractured limbs, and various ones, if of each one separately.
Caput II.	 Title II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter the main points, and chapters, to which understanding is first required of the craftsman at his station over their truth: namely that you, and those ready for it, know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say therefore, that when a fracture, dislocation, twist or fall occurs to someone, then it is necessary, firstly, to hurry towards bleeding him and loosening him, or both at the same time: unless something forbids it, such as weakness of strength; or it happens to a child or an old weak person; or it is a time of intense heat or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, beans and heads; and forbid wine, heavy meats, and being filled with any food or anything that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until he is safe from a hot fever and does not fear the outflow of matter to the limb; then let the sick one return first to his usual regimen with which his custom was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the sick one eat nourishing foods in large quantities, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads and feet, entrails of cows, eggs, fresh fish, strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 And with this regimen, the healing of the fracture is done more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the drying of their limbs; and the bones which are from these are consolidated and united at the end of gentleness, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue around the broken bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, with which it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated against each other, and tied together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not forbid it something because of its operations; and because of this cause, it is necessary that you put the food of the sick in heavy foods, with thickness and viscosity, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the differences of the limbs; since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other members are different from each other; and I come with the reminder of all types of fractures exposed in their respective chapters distinct from one another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of fractures themselves are also diverse.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since a fracture occurs curved, except when stars appear in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and there are its splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding from them, as are found in a pen when it is sharpened for writing with a knife.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with wound and rupture at the head; and there is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And to each type there is a skill or specific tool for its restoration, according to which its memory will come, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which is known about a bone fracture, it is its crookedness and prominence; its appearance to the senses; and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore no crookedness appears in the place, nor does a sound occur to your touch when you press the bone with movement, nor does it cause great pain; then there is no fracture at that place, indeed it may be a crookedness or small fissure; therefore it is not necessary to move it with the hand and complete compression, but rather place medicines over it, whose memory comes after the time appropriate for the place; then a bandage is tightened with a fine string.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when the place is bent and divided, except for what happens in it as satagiae, nevertheless remove all parts from their comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour for its correction, equating it before hot ulcer occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If a hot ulcer occurs, then let it be for some days until the ulcer subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then equal it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it and its equating is easier than bones, where satagia occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tighten it, according to what comes to your recollection of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If satagia occurs in a bone, then extension of this broken member is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be that in which you place the member over an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member extend: then try to make those additions with all skill and according to whatever method you can in their places: and take care according to your strength, so that pain does not occur to the weak due to your operation or injury: and try according to your strength to apply one of two bones with its partner, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary at that time for you to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And avoid a violent extension and a strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often they cause a hot ulcer or constriction in the member through their operation, as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then attach after the incision, and proper surgical procedure, and the compression of that member, and peace, and calmness: and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And let him be careful not to move it during the hour of his watch, and sleep, at its revolution, and agitation, and at its discharge, and all movements during the last strength of his power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And let him be careful that the position of the member is not one that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 This is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the member, then it is necessary that he moves himself to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And be careful that his position is equal and straight: so that no curvature occurs in the member when it heals.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the compression for a broken member is as I have said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that fractured members differ according to their size, and their magnitude, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, club, and similar to them, then it is necessary for there to be a soft, subtle wrapping of cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 But those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, firm wrapping of cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a broad bandage connects a large member and compresses it from every side with equal compression so that no spot is left bare.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then after your evacuation, place the suitable linen on it from the incision, on a soft cushion above the fracture site.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the bandage over the fracture site three or four times, according to how deserving the member is: and compress your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go with him to the upper part from the place of the break, and tie less than your previous binding, which you bound the broken place with.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then draw out a little further from the place of the break, and soften the binding slowly until you take a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another plaster, and apply it again to the broken place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then go downwards with the bandage towards the lower part from the break.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your work be in binding and softening of the bandage, and in the manner as I said in the first bandaging above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the bandages pieces of soft flax or cloth, equal to the curvature of the break if there is any curvature in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then apply another plaster over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place stars evenly spaced immediately above these bandages, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in that place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or an abscess there, then place that which sits on the abscess and remove the swelling; and let it be for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind those stars over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the stars be made from the middle parts of thick reeds, shaved and skillfully formed; or let them be made of wood from which cribra are made, which are made from pine, yew, palm tree branches or calingi; and let the width of each star be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the star that is placed over the trace should be a little larger and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to what is allowed by the member in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind over the Star with another ointment, according to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind firmly with threads, as we have said concerning binding; and it should be that your binding is stronger over the place of the break, and the farther it is from the break, the less the binding should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 The threads must be of moderate thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of fools placing their own twisted cords of rough linen, it is a great error; since the binding falls off with them beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And thin threads again do not suit; because you will not achieve with them through the binding what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between one star and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick person is hurt by the extremities of the stars after binding in healthy places: then place under them soft wool or camlet, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a break with a wound, and rupture occurs in the skin, I will come back to it with its own discussion in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken member needs to be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 That is because when a member is large, it is not necessary to place stars on top of it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of cold abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters that the ancients used, which are placed on a break and displacement.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 The common method of plaster, restoring a break, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children; since it is from that which heat does not overcome nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is that you receive from mill-dust, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and you shall make it as such, except that sieves it with egg white: and place its mixture not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plaster, for the healing of a fracture, dislocation and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take almess, laudanum, acacia, enula and mugath: and macerate all with ten parts of myrrh, five parts of both aloes and twenty parts of alethil. All should be crushed and sifted, and mixed with water of alethil, or with egg white if the plaster is applied to a weak person who is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is a good composition, it quickly heals broken bones and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of plaster, which also helps for fractures and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugath, mess, white alteae, all with ten parts of myrrh, five parts of both aloes and six parts of acacia, a pound of Armenian bolus twenty times, all should be crushed and sifted, and made with water or egg white: and administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of plaster for joining bones and those separated from their places: it soothes the pain that occurs to them, and the separation of a bone, and a fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Wool juice is taken, and it is immersed in vinegar and boiled oil: and it is placed on the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed, this plaster does not have the virtue of healing, but it is good for the soothing of a hot boil: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method for applying a plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the fig tree that is deaf and leaves of wild parsnip: grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method for a speedy application of a plaster for the restoration of a broken bone, and when you want to dissolve the remnants of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take equal parts of the root of althea, chamomile, marigold flowers, herb flour, all in one part: grind all of them, and make a decoction with wine if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then make it with coriander water or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for a stronger plaster in the resolution, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take equal parts of the root of althea, flax seeds, boxwood, licorice root, sampsucke, marigold flowers, chamomile, all in one part: grind all of them and make a decoction with willow water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply it according to the heat of the member and the calmness of its warmth.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken member during its restoration except a preparation made from wax and oil; nothing else. And he said it should be of a medium between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus, however, thought that things should be placed on a broken member during its restoration which have the heating property, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense, and similar things from those mentioned before.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method for a plaster that promotes injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Make a paste of equal parts of ground chickpea, human hair or goose feather, and althea (marshmallow root), along with salt: grind and sift it; then make an ointment from this mixture.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount required to make the bandage remain in place is such that if there is no pain or itching, nor does the bone move from its place, then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If itchiness, distressing pain, or swelling occurs at the site, then hasten and dissolve it within an hour, remove the ointment from there; take a soft cloth or seawater sponge, moistened; immerse it in warm water and wash the area until the itch subsides and the pain is alleviated.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it (the limb) wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; tie it over it at night until you are free from the danger of hot infection, and let the swelling of the limb subside and the pain be alleviated.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the same process for a delicate binding and a small amount of ointment; do not bind it tightly with your first bandage or with a delicate one until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you require an ointment and binding, then repeat the same procedure as before equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what was mentioned happens to the limb, then do not dissolve it before three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is permitted after twenty days according to the appearance of the dissolution of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of the flesh near it; add also more binding in your bandage than your first one completely; and also increase the intake of food for the sick person, as much as the memory of the previous advice suggests.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the place of fracture is already drying out and shrinking too much: then you will know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore, anoint the area with warm oil and water at every spot where you dissolve it, and let it be for all three days, and apply a little softening agent to relax it slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this procedure, nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 What foolish restorers do instead of restoring the fractured member by what is proper, when they do not restore it first as required, and restore it according to its curvature, is an error in their procedure, and there is great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen any trace of theirs whatsoever in that matter, and it is better not to do that.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on the making of a fracture in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Types of fractures are diverse, and their shapes are numerous; causes of the same are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For the fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword: the blow removes the bone completely until it reaches the siphac, which is below the bone, just as an ax cuts through wood: and for this reason, the species of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its face, but does not penetrate through to the end of it: and this type of fracture is called Kalan, that is, Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And a wound from two types of fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And the fracture that is crushing or grinding: and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 This fracture is also penetrating, which is approaching the padding that is under bone: or it is on the face of the bone: and this wound belongs to these two kinds of fractures, whether small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 This fracture is hidden within the bone in the subtlety of hair: and it is a small crack, for which reason this type of fracture is named Capillary Fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 Among these [types of fractures] is a fracture that occurs due to an accident or being struck by a stone, and these cause the bone layer to enter into the interior, forming a hollow: as it happens with the crucibles of metal, when they are struck and a part of them enters into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 This is most often found in the moist bones of the head, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 All these kinds of fractures are set separately, and I will return with the explanation of this [entire matter] in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We know all these kinds of fractures through examination of it, and investigation of them with probes, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary type is known through this: that it is revealed on the bone, scraped, and lined up on top of it with pitch: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the condition of the patient: then if you see signs from his condition that indicate fearfulness, such as vomiting cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, eye problems, redness of eyes and similar signs in many other conditions, without a doubt it will not heal: and if you see the patient's conditions are not terrifying to you, and hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded person comes to you in the first instance and is wounded: and it happens during winter days, then it is necessary that you study bone excision before the fourteenth day according to every arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is during the summer days, then it is necessary that you hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes rotten under the bone from the tissue, and such accidents occur as we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the bone fracture has already reached the tissue touching the brain and is accompanied by pieces and pulling: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and smoothed parts according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 It is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded person and scrape over the bone as much as possible for you, according to the shape of the wound and what is light over the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during the scraping of the bone a flow of blood or a hot abscess: then put what is necessary against it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is necessary that you fill the place with soaked cloths in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin the healing of the bone, and the removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 The first method is to cut the bone with a knife having a narrow blade: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 And administer another knife wider than the previous one a little: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer another knife even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that there should be a number of knives of different sizes among you; some of which are wider than others and some shorter than others: and they should be at the end of sharpness extremities, and made of Indian iron or copper, and use them with ease in striking the knife so as not to strike the head and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary that you perforate around its circumference before you administer Incisoria, with Terebris which are called Terebra not penetrating deeply; and they are not so named except because they do not pass through the bone's flesh to what is beyond it; therefore, because the Terebra has a rounded end above that which is beneath its head, and a small circle prevents submerging, and passing through the bone's thickness.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is necessary for you to take a great number of these Terebris, one of which suits the thickness of the bone, until there is for you all the Terebra that fits the skull; whose sharp end's size in length and width should be according to the thickness of the skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of Terebris or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforating the bone's circumference after it is broken, is that you place the Terebra on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the position of the Terebra to another place, and put in its place what is equal to the size of a finger or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incisoria what is between every hole in the bone; and do it more delicately than you can on the top of it, as we have said, until you excavate the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for that purpose: such as tenaliae and delicate forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And you must be careful with all caution, lest the Terebra or any Incisoria touch something from the skull.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you perforate the bone and it has been separated from the skull, if it is continuous with it and you extract it, then it is necessary to scrape and make equal the end that remains in the bone with another tool similar to an Incisoria.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 It is necessary that it be thin and delicate more than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of the small bones and cartilage, then take it with ease, along with what is at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen cloths and unguents as we said before.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy, completely distant from fear; which Galen said and praised greatly; and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First, you must begin to expose the bone piece from the place where the fracture is more violent and clear; until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the end of this concave incisor, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The concave part does not cut anything; and the sharp part of it facing in both directions along its length, as you see; so that the concave part is attached to the bone, with the sharp part incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike on the incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it is turned; and be careful that no cloth (panniculo) from you happens to fall into what is happening, which you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were not more foolish than men and ignorant of this, nor was he sleeping, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloths in some places, he would cut it off with the end of the concave incisor itself and release it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is released from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its face, and roughness and delicate cartilage remain in it; then it is necessary that you grind down the roughness, and dig out the delicate cartilages with fine rasps, which you have prepared of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to apply them more suitable and correct ones in every place according to what leads you the operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 It is necessary that you administer [the operation] according to your own judgment, firstly cutting the bone, more widely than those who scrape it off.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer tool after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not stop doing it continuously until you reach the point of administering it more thinly and finer than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In every one of the remaining small fissures and a fine fracture, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a matter that does not hide over all, to whomever has any interest in this art, and it stands on what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If a membrane is found to be retained when you remove the bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another doubled or tripled cloth, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do that as easily as possible on top of it, so that it is not burdened by moisture.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a broad ligament over it: and do not tighten it, unless for the amount that holds the wound only: and release it with this care for one day or two days, until you are certain about the hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it, and administer afterwards medicines with which excess dryness is needed: such as the roots of garlic, and wheat flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things: and there is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is dusted over the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer all medicine in it of the nature that cleans and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 "And be careful according to your virtue, so that the wound may be clean during your treatment: there should not be dirt from ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 "Do not allow pus to accumulate at all: since when pus accumulates on the brain tissue, it corrodes and rots it, causing great harm to the sick person afterwards; and this has already happened with the skull, when the bone is being cleaned by him, especially when care for it is neglected. A blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 "Therefore, if the conditions that I mentioned occur in the sick person, know that it is surely fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 "And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine applied to him and it is effective in its action so that it makes this blackness: then one should take a portion of honey, three portions of rose oil, and anoint with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 "Then place it on the skull; afterwards take care of him with the means of healing that are appropriate, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 "On the restoration of a broken nose.
Caput IIII.	 "Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 "Know that the nose is not broken except when both of its upper parts are broken at once or only one of them: because it consists of two bones; since below it is cartilaginous and does not break, but only becomes bruised, distorted, and crooked.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 "If one of the two parts is broken, then one should insert a small finger into the nose and push the fracture back with the index and thumb to its normal shape; this should be done skillfully.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 "And be careful that pain does not occur in the sick person during your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach it with the finger: then, it is necessary to align the extremity of the radius, where there should be a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that one: and bring together with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest with the cauterization of warm lard.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of flax from linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part: or insert two pieces of flax if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be a swelling on the flax of such size that it fills the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the old restorers said, that the flax should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But this does not seem to me, rather it is necessary that the flax should be soaked in egg white, made with flour mill powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release the flax when the bone hardens and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather of the goose is inserted into the nose in place of flax after it has been covered with soft cloth: and this makes it so that the feather holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so as not to prevent the weak from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do it: if you want, do it with flax.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose again forms an abscess while treating it with warm cautery, apply a nasal plaster with pitch, or with pitch soaked in rose oil, or a little with balsam of Mecca.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if no abscess forms with the warm cautery, then it is necessary to apply plasters made of sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth upon it (the wound), and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If however the nasal bones are broken or crushed, then it is necessary that you make an incision over them and extract them with instruments suitable for the purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then apply a suture and take care of it with that which causes it to heal, using ointments or plasters suitable for the purpose.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with linen and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then observe whether the fracture is only on the outside and is not broken into two pieces, and bends inward: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the weak jaw: similarly, if the fracture is in the left lower jaw, then insert your right index finger: and press with it the protrusion of the fracture from inside to outside with ease using your other hand from the inner part of the bone correctly, and equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the lower jaw has already separated into two pieces, then administer traction from both sides according to straightness: until it is possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If however a loosening or displacement of the teeth has already occurred, then tie them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a soft cushion on the fractured lower jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place a double cloth on the fractured lower jaw, and place over it a large star-shaped cushion made properly: or an equal piece of skin from a sandal in length to the jaw bone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it up from above, according to how you prepare its ligature, and let it rest until it is healed: and instruct the patient to be at peace and rest: and put for his food softened meals.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If however you think that something is changing in the figure by any means: then be quick, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct whatever has been changed from it, and apply plaster made of milled flour with egg white, or with sifted wheat flour, after you have removed the scabs: and place soft wool on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that plaster remains attached to it and the bone arrangement does not change, let it be, without removing it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is bound many times in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If however a warm abscess occurs in the meantime: then administer what I said many times for its reduction, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if a piece of bone is separated, or from a sawing: then be subtle in this, to remove those pieces of sawing with what suits you for the removal of them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If however the wound opening is narrow: then enlarge it with a leech according to your needs.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the sawing, and nothing remains of them: or if the wound opening is wide: and if not, place on it from plasters that suit for this, and let it heal until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of a Fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The fork is broken most often from the front part from the shoulder, and its fracture is made according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 For it is broken and separated into two, except that there occur in it suppurations: and it is more easily restored to its state.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 For such as occur in the bone, suppurations: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 For such as is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in it when there is a fracture without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, one of whom holds the splintered furcula, and the other stretches the neck towards the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its form is made, according to what is required: and let there be neither prominence nor hollowing in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the neck of the weak one a sphere made from cloth or wool: and let its size be according to your need: and stretch, lift, and squeeze the sphere with your hand until you equalize the fracture, according to what is required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the furcula outwards because it has reached deep: then it is necessary that the weak one lies down on his neck: and place under his shoulder a beam in size, and press the minister under his arm towards the lower part, until the bone of the furcula which is deep is lifted upwards: and then correct the fracture, and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If, however, you feel a suppuration from the furcula and it moves: then it is necessary that you make an incision over it, and extract the suppuration easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it remains in the bone, then make a handle on the incision of it with one of the Incisorium which you have prepared for that purpose, after you place under the furcula an instrument which saves the saw: and it is an instrument made from wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to the need of that bone's size and proportions.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length of it as much as possible for your operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And have two extremities, as you see; and one extremity be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the wound rupture which you split when extracting satheiatum bone is wide, and your cauterizing iron is hot, then gather two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the rupture is small, or fear hot cauterizing iron; then fill the wound with cloths and wool, according to the amount of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If it happens that hot cauterizing iron occurs, then pour oil of roses on the cloth, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But the fixation of bone without a wound and without cutting is, to place plaster on the bone made from flour milled with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And put soft wool on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under the wound if it is needed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a leech, that is, the roll which the Saracens hold, which is very long; and its width should be as wide as one palm, or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a double piece of wool on top of the soft wool and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a needle from fine wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then thread the needle with cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then thread the cloth with the needle in the place of the leech which falls on the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the leech on the fracture as it is rolled, and thread it over its neck, and under the healthy wound, and under the sick wound; and return it over all parts, and so that the fixation holds the fracture properly; and this is what must not be hidden from you, and completely, so that the needle does not move over the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary to observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the ligament becomes soft and you see the knot being removed, then correct it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick man's sleep on his back and place a small pill under his pillow at night so that when he wakes up, his aid may be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, raise the fracture of the collarbone by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Either bind his arm to his neck and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens in a place that is swollen due to itching or from an abscess, for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the constriction and release it until it is restored and healed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the collarbone is bound and supported for up to twenty days; it may be less in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the restoration of the Fractured Spatula (Scapula).
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The scapula rarely breaks in a wide place; it does not break except at its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it breaks from there, and breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known unless by touch, then make the preparation according to the shape of the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place flour of milling with egg white and soft wool over it and put a pillow made of double cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place the wide knot under it from a thin board according to the size of the scapula or larger but not too much.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is a concavity under the knot at some place on the scapula, then fill it with soft wool until the knot descends to the same level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then apply a tourniquet above with sufficient tightness and firmness, until it is no longer moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the bandage daily.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever therefore the bandage becomes soft, tighten it, and equalize the pressure if it is moved from its place: let the weak side lie upon the healthy one.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 The spatula is restored in twenty or thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from bones whose fracture is not feared nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If however it protrudes from the bone and punctures under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as I have said in the treatment of a fracture of the neck of the femur by hot poultice, if anything occurs from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a breastbone fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, and this happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 However, its extremities are broken and crushed more frequently due to accidents of it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle of it is broken, which inclines towards the lower part, and a violent pain occurs in it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps blood vomiting occurs, and the hollow in the fractured bone is evident to the sense, and not covered: the restoration of this is that the weak side lies upon its back: and place between its spatulas a cushion.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press the shoulders and join the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands: and grind it evenly, according to every way in which this can be done and fits together, until the figure of the bone returns, as required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place on top of it an ointment and a powder, and place on top of that a thin star-shaped piece made from willow or boxwood, or similar materials, after you have rolled it up in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then wrap it around the broken bone, so that it is not removed: and go with the bandage following the roundness to the back several times, and bind it tightly enough.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bandage at every hour and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if its necessity causes it to dissolve due to itching or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, remove the ointment, and correct what happened with the treatment method.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then reduce the ointment if you see it going to that face; and join a tight bandage until healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on Restoring Costal Bones, when they break.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that a costal bone fracture does not occur except in large areas that follow the back and from their extremities on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it is not caused by friction, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the detection of this is not concealed from touch during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of this is done so that the break can be aligned with fingers to the best possible extent until it matches the shape as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply an ointment and bind the broken bone with a star-shaped piece if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the costal bone fracture is towards the interior: then it causes a strong painful sensation, and puncture, like the puncture that occurs in pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there is difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood many times; this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised that remedy with many devices: and among them are those who say to put foods for the sick which generate inflammation and gas, so that the stomach is inflamed, and it is stretched and driven outward in order to heal a fracture from outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We reject, that it should not be caused quickly to make a hot abscess, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already happened, then add it (the treatment) into it (the wound).
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: place a windy substance on the place, then apply suction with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, there is fear that windy substances will attract excess into the place, due to its weakened condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil: and lice (puluilli) should be placed between the ribs until it is filled: so that the bandage is equal when you wind it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person is treated with a remedy for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the affliction presses too hard on the sick person and hurts him with a sharp instrument, piercing his flesh by wounding it, then we fear for the sick man: then it is necessary that we cut through the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we will place on it (the wound) an instrument that heals a sifac, whose name has been mentioned before: and we will cut the bone with ease, and we will cut it (the sifac).
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we will join together two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and we will treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If a hot abscess should happen meanwhile, then hurry and pour lice into rose oil, and place it on the spot: and the sick person is treated with what is suitable for treating an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 The patient should also lie on the opposite side until he is cured.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Spine and Neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they are rubbed [against each other]: and similarly with the spondyles of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 If this happens to someone and one desires to know whether it can be healed or not: then examine [the case].
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see the hands already softened, stunned, and dead; and it cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, it does not feel this or pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If it moves them and feels the pressure with your fingers and the prick: then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the weak one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens with the spondyles of the back similarly to this case, and one desires to know whether it can be healed or not: then examine his feet; then if you see that they are softened and this happens in them as it happened in the hands; then when he lies on his back, he expels wind and faeces involuntarily; and when he lies on his abdomen, he expels faeces involuntarily; and when he lies on his back again and wishes to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore do not labor in treating it.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing of this happens to him, it is lighter [in nature].
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for this is to apply heat with a mustard plaster [to the affected spondyle]: so that you place oil of rose over the rubbed spondyle alone; or with hog's lard heated.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on that place several times a day until the hot abscess is assuaged; then place one of the strengthening, drying, and binding plasters over it, and bind it with a ligament; and order the sick person to rest quietly and in peace.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He shall not sleep on the part where he found pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens due to the rubbing of a bone (sathaim), or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary for him to cut across the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suturing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for himself with some soft dressing, from ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If however the last bone (alhaws) of the shin splint is broken and it is the end of the heel: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand to align the broken bone as much as possible, according to what is possible, and in a second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place him on it (the bone), and remove it; and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on the restoration of anus (Anca).
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Fractures of the bones of the ankles are rare.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are fractured, then the fracture is not anything except comminution at their extremities; and they are divided lengthwise, and slant towards the inside; and there occurs pain in that place, and puncturing; and the leg that was fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what you prepare yourself from the equation, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If however the fracture is in its length, or it already turns towards the inside: then make the weak one lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have equalized it, place a plaster on it; then place an astel (a splint) made of wood or hide over it and tie a suture on it where you are not afraid of altering the fracture or removing the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And equal the concavity of them with what fills it until the suture takes it in accordance with the equality; and command the weak one to sleep on his back or on a healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If a hot abscess occurs to him: then stop extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place whatever is beneath it on it, according to what has passed, then return to its restoration; and tie it as needed.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If however it happens to the bone that it swells or breaks out: extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The helper (tool) is that which is between the elbow and head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of these methods is: that you receive a flat wooden board of medium thickness, in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two ligaments are to be tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the weak one shall sit on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he should throw his broken arm over a log until he reaches the notch of that log, where the break of the log is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then let something heavy be placed upon him from above, so that the servant may stretch him towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician shall set the fracture with his hands until it returns to its proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is that the weak one lies on his neck; and let his hand hang from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two servants that one holds what is above the fracture with his hands; and let another hold below it, and each one of them stretches to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage; and let each of the two servants stretch to his own sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the fracture is close to the shoulder end, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the notch and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then set the fracture easily without difficulty, until it is level according to what is necessary, and applied correctly; then bind it if no warm abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a warm abscess occurs, then release the binding for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place linen that has been soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it until the abscess subsides; then bind it: and the method of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place the inversion from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm onto the support itself, and put his open hand on his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place the cloth and bind it over the support so that the arm remains in place like a star: if something does not prevent you from doing this, nor will anything move due to a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you are afraid that something will move due to a broken bone, then use a star: and there is one, by which you place the larger and stronger star over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place the width of each star equal to a digit: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture, with an addition of three digits from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the stars with the bandage as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And your binding should be tighter than the fracture site.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the fracture extends more, let the binding be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and the binding as we have said, then do it at the hour when you restore the limb immediately: but if you fear a hot abscess, then let go of the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the binding in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or food is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct therefore everything as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are confident that nothing will happen from this: then do not loosen the binding, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 Let the weak person sleep on his back and place his hand on his stomach: and put woolen socks full of wool equally under the support.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 Consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the figure of the broken member is not loosened, nor is the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct it entirely with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place food for the sick according to the order we have given you, so that it is a subtle food first, until the bone begins to bind; then it is necessary, that you increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of help and the member is to bind for forty days; then it is necessary, that it be loosened, and a bath be given, and it be treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen from it the ligament and splints for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two humeruses.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and it follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other one is large, and it is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Perhaps only the large humerus breaks, or perhaps both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore the small humerus above breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the large humerus below breaks, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse when both bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that breaks is the small humerus above, then it is fitting for the physician at its restoration, to place a sling smaller with ease until it equals itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however the large humerus is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to place a strong splint very tightly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 It is necessary that [the figure] of the hand be placed at its restoration, and its [full] extension extended over the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb shall be higher than all the fingers, and the lower joint (of the thumb) shall be higher than all the digits or the rest: and the weakened square one resting on itself, and there shall be a pulley before it or directly in front of it, at its level, so that the weakened does not fall into labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the attendant stretch the arm from its lower part with his hand or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another attendant shall stretch likewise from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician sets the bone until he brings it back to its best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are pus-filled cavities (sinuses) in the bone fracture, then strive to replace every splinter in its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if it appears separated and pustular (abscessed) and penetrating the skin and there is no hope of restoration for it: then incise over it, and excise it according to the manner which was previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if there is a fracture with a wound, I have already written a separate chapter on this matter, so take care of it from that point.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If at the beginning of your restoration an abscess arises that is hot, then apply a linen cloth prepared with wax made from rose oil, white wax, and medium thickness: and bind the cloth over it tightly with a narrow ligature until when the abscess subsides: then remove the wax, and place an ointment prepared from flour mill powder and egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place pins, and the pin that is placed over the fracture should be slightly larger and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of pins for the arm is six in most cases: whether the fracture occurs in one splint or two splints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage stronger and more forceful over the stronger and more prominent part of the fracture, and a little further towards its upper or lower parts: or place a softer bandage around it according to what was previously remembered at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 The wrappings to be used on the fracture should be soft, moist: and they should not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread for binding be of linen, middle between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and ligament after several days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If anything happens which requires correction, such as itching on the limb: then it is necessary that you apply embrocation to the limb with warm water until the itching stops, and leave the limb unbound until it calms down; then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the bandage has already been softened and the bone removed, and similar things have happened: then correct that completely with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 If nutrition is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive bandaging, then it is necessary to soften it slightly, and leave it for some days until it reaches the nutrition; then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of what has been said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen him, unless after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick person is suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be straight, and keep it protected from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is healed within thirty or forty days; and perhaps it is healed within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of that depends on the temperaments and dispositions of humors and virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Restoration of broken hands.
Caput XIIII.	 De Ossibus et Squillis, et de Cur
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the hand comb and finger knots rarely occur a fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him, unless it is rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When a foot fracture occurs or is rubbed, then it is necessary that the patient sits on a low stool, and before him there should be a seat equal in height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then put his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the servant spreads out the broken bones, and the doctor aligns them until they are joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place plaster and wool, unless there occurs a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then put a splint on top according to the size of the place: and you have already wound it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is below about the belly of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth: and command the patient to bend over it with his broken foot: then tie it with long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be of parchment, in which there is softness, so that it can be applied to the skin of the sole: and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint on top and another one below on the foot: and keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put a bandage, as the hand is rolled up: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there occurs a fracture in any finger knot, then if it is the thumb, align it as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie with the foot: and if there are any more, place a straight splint, smaller, to lift the fracture and not move it.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, little finger or ring finger, then align it and tie it with the healthy finger that follows it: or tie all of them according to continuity: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Place a small awl upon it [the part], as we have said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration, and after the arrangement of the amputation of heat, and set against it what is required, when something happens from that [object], according to its repeated narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the repair of a broken Hip.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thigh bone is often broken and revealed to the senses because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its repair is done by tightening a ligament above the break, and another ligament below the break.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The sick person stretches himself upon his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then extend all the ligaments serving its part equally; and this when the break is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If however the break is close to the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament for the neck part, so that the extension falls upward; and another ligament below the break.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the break is close to the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee, so that the extension falls towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician adjusts the bone with both hands until he reduces it to its original shape; and the bone unites by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you apply plaster and a tight bandage if no abscess occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess should occur there: then let it be left for several days until the abscess becomes hot; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage of this [limb] should therefore be as follows.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wind a hard plaster around the break, that is, bandage; and double it twice or three times; and there remains an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wind the leg until the heel reaches the root of the natural joint.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 Insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper parts of the two areas.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll up (the skin) over the leg and hip what remains from the incision.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Next, place stars (splints or bandages) on the hip in the location of the fracture, and place one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the voids between the leg and hip with soft cloths so that it matches the tightness (of the wound).
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a strong suture from the middle above the location of the fracture with three or four revolutions.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you lengthen the suture from the location of the fracture, let your stitch be smaller, softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Next, aim for the ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Then bind three stars (splints or bandages) on both sides (of the wound).
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Next, follow the ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with both sides bind also the ends of the stars so that the suture is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the stitch until it remains so that there is no rot on the limb, no abscess, no swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something happens from this (the treated area).
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore, when the solution is applied to it, correct whatever has happened there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 But if there is a splinter in the bone that it pierces: then it is necessary to equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, bind over it and remove it: and care about the one who preceded the reminder until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And at times this hip fracture is tightened, apart from the addition of pegs, as we said in aid and arm. (Translated from Latin)
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in its restoration, such a fracture does not cause lameness to the weak. (Translated from Latin)
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored alone, apart from applying another leg to it, then it is necessary that he who has it will always limp. (Translated from Latin)
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 Know that the hip becomes tightened in fifty days or less, or it is added too little, or it is reduced too little; all this is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions. (Translated from Latin)
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Restoration of a fracture of the knee-cap. (Translated from Latin)
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI. (Translated from Latin)
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee-cap rarely occurs a fracture, but it frequently occurs attrition. (Translated from Latin)
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If indeed it occurs a fracture, then it is not other than a fissure or an opening in its parts. (Translated from Latin)
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 It is that with a wound and without a wound. (Translated from Latin)
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands upon it entirely with feeling. (Translated from Latin)
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 Its restoration is as follows: equalizing what has been split from its parts with fingers until it is gathered and joined according to what is possible by equalization and ease, and construction. (Translated from Latin)
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster made of rice flour or milled flour with egg white; and place upon it a round peg if needed; and bind above with a bandage suitable for that. (Translated from Latin)
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions which we have mentioned in other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar cases; so that you present every occurrence with what is suitable for it until it heals. (Translated from Latin)
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Restoration of a Leg Fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that there are two bones in the leg, one is large and called the shinbone (cruris); and the other is slender, and is called the calf bone (focile).
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 It happens with both kinds of fracture that it occurs with two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones break simultaneously, the leg turns towards all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 If a bone breaks more finely, the leg turns towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If a bone breaks coarsely, you will find it lower: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer the extension, equalization, and ligature of stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the fracture of the leg is a dirty fracture with many setragies, it should have a smaller and softer extension, and a gentler alleviation by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something about the operation that is similar to the arm: and it is, when you equalize the stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two bands from pine wood, which are used in the making of solariums placed under tables, and they are made of spatulas of the palm; and choose those with a small thickness, and not too thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold one band over another with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side and the other on the other side: let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie the two bands in three places at the two ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For it is forbidden to bind, the leg turns towards the right and left, and stands well with a good stance.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now the cradle made of wood according to the length of the leg should be placed under it, to keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is most important that you make this [the treatment] when there is a wound with the fracture itself.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day, and take care of it with utmost diligence to prevent aposteme, inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If anything from those (afflicts), then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of Bones of the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneum indeed does not suffer complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the foot indeed sometimes suffer fracture, and fractures of the fingers do not happen very often: and they do not occur to them except by severe injury at several points.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see the bone protruding beyond itself, then place the sick man's foot on the ground prepared as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then you stand there, and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones; then press or tread upon it; and hold it equally, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place a poultice and a plaster on top of it; and put a small table beneath the foot with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a decent bandage when you have wrapped it in linen and other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then unbind the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones aligned, whether they are broken or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is therefore as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are broken, then restore them, and align them as I have told you in the restoration of fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a stylus along the length of your finger and let it be slightly wider than the finger; then put this table beneath the foot as I have told you, and bind it with a decent bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is broken is two or three bones, or more, then place a stylus of the same size over each finger and wrap it in linen; and bind the table beneath the foot; and let there be a standing on one head of the table outside the foot to hold it with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is fitting for you, lest you forget, to consider all that I told you about the other fractures regarding the accidents we mentioned; and apply the appropriate solution to every accident.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On the fracture of a woman's jaw, and the breastbone, and a man's long bone.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her towards the back of the same slightly and hold her in that position.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Next, a midwife fills the woman's jaw with a linen cloth until it is full; and the jaw becomes as round as a sphere from this.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then strike the woman gently, and gradually reduce her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 This linen cloth emerges until it becomes before the mouth of the jaw as round as a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a small cushion under her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever she wishes to spit, let her easily remove the linen cloth, then spit; and bring it back according to the amount you first inserted; then return to the cushion again.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let this be done for seven days or approximately; for the bone itself recovers.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of a hen, and tie it around its orifice with a reed tube, and insert the entire bladder into her jaw.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the jaw; for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be filled with linen cloth and stay for some days as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the breastbone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer its treatment and apply what we have said regarding the anchorage for the bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not hidden that the right [side] is not concealed in close fractures which happen little, particularly for one who has some interest or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book very much, because the fracture itself indicates to you in many dispositions the way of the right [side] in its restoration and the narrowing of it: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When a man's member breaks, take the throat of a goose; and insert the staff [into it].
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place upon it a covering from cloth, and wrap [it], and let it be for three days or about them, and it will heal if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 On the restoration of bone fracture when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for the one who has a fracture along with a wound, especially if it is large like the hip bone or humerus, to rush and summon a phlebotomist immediately; if you are informed of the conditions of phlebotomy as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary for you to rush for its amputation, so that you pour powdered lime over it if nothing else is present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day; and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If however, an abscess hot occurs, then delay the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth days, for you will cause him to suffer additional harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is sticking out from the skin exposed: then it is necessary to try to bring it back and align it with your hands easily and slightly extended.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If however the extension is not prepared, and the arm itself is equal to your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the tool is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers: and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And for that reason it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity required for the treatment of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round: and let its thickness be small, so as not to increase during the application of pressure on it during the hour of surgery: and let its sharp edges have a margin at their ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the upper part of it be thick up to the middle, but below that let it be thin.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation, the sharp end should be bent and placed over the protruding bone's extremity: and push it with it together until when the bone returns and is equalized in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore try to align the fracture ends against each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the fracture ends are fine and do not accept the tool properly, then it is necessary to cut the bone end until the tool can hold it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If however you cannot reduce the bones with what I have described, then cut it with the chisels we mentioned, or saw it with one of your saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then plane down what remains on the bone from roughness and fine layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and after its removal a very strong pain arises that hurts it, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make it so.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you bring great help to the sick, when you complete the restoration that you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse the linen in strong wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place on the wound cicatricles or anything containing oil; so that it does not cause decay and corruption at the same spot.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer the splinters in the hour of the completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound undressed; thus, so that you cut with forceps a hole in the swellings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Be careful not to squeeze the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For often have fools done this; and they have caused death, or corruption, or gangrene on their own patients, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And your suture be soft, gentle, diverse from the other sutures for fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear some bad incidents that we have mentioned, and you find pain at a suspended place; then it is not necessary to place splinters on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make swellings from hard cloths in the place of splinters and stitch it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 And when it has been a day or two, and you see the wound begin to produce pus; then remove from above it the linen that you had placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds; such as ointment of four ingredients (tetrapharmacon) and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is suitable for you to dissolve the suture.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it heals and cures.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus runs out from it with ease towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor the pus is discharged from it: then you know that there are small fractures of bones in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 It is necessary to examine the wound with pressure (or probing).
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 As for how many of those small fractures have been separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which have not been separated and are boring the limb and causing pain, try to cut them and remove them in every way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If pimples (zuchen) or boils (ekileten), i.e., abscesses, or any other corruption and putrefaction should occur at the wound: then it is necessary to apply each of them with what corresponds to it from the remedies whose narration preceded in their respective chapters.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from that where my discourse must remain silent, and to whom you should direct your mind when a bone breaks and protrudes upon the limb, such as the hip bone, or the shoulder, or similar large bones, it is not to presume its attraction; for often death occurs from it, indeed let it be, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Therefore treat the wound if it seems to you; and if not, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a nodule (Nodation) in the fracture of a limb.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This nodule occurs many times in the course of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Above all, that which is near joints; and it becomes foul from this figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural movement.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore consider if the nodule is recent; administer to it remedies that have astringent properties, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum Arabic, acacia and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Therefore, take some or all of them [the medicines]: and bind them with staunchion wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling, and tightly bind them over the good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And release the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it, and apply another one until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind over it a sheet of lead well.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the swelling has already turned into a stone and is tightly bound and there is an urgent need to remove it: then bind something above it from its upper part, and cut off the excessive protrusion; or shave it with certain scrapers until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 [Chapter title: Treatment when the member has been restored but remains tender after that]
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the member remains tender after that, weak: then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is a multiplicity of loosening and tying of the ligament not as required; or due to an excessive binding of the ligaments, preventing nutrition from reaching the member; or due to an excess of embrocation at an inappropriate time; or due to a lack of blood in the body of the sick person and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment for this is to feed the sick person and make his body soft until blood increases in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 Apply the ointment to it with warm water until the wound heals and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 On the treatment of broken bones when they are set twistedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a restored member, after its healing, becomes twisted or protrudes due to fractured bone or nodulation, and is disfigured by this condition of the limb; however, the limb does not prohibit its natural operation; then it is not necessary that you accept the advice of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers, who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is extremely blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, lest it be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if lameness and nodulation are recent: then it is necessary to apply warm water in which soothing herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of althea, its root, melilotus, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And make for him an ointment with a soothing plaster, such as well-made dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or take the mucilage from the root of althea, pound it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or figs are taken, powdered with dove dung, and similar substances that are called from medicines reducing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes nodulation is resolved through persistent gentle rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And the movement of the limb should be administered to all its parts every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If the twisting has already occurred, and it has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and its treatment with iron is necessary: then it is necessary to make an incision above it, and to break the continuation of the bone, and to cut off what is superfluous from nodulation or bone with fine instruments; and apply ease to that with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 "On Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 "Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 "Dislocation is the displacement of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 "Why it is forbidden to move and it disfigures the shape of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 "And causes heavy pains to occur on the weak and violent injuries."\]
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 "When therefore a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to hurry for its restoration; not at all delaying it."\]
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 "For if it is delayed, the location will be lost and perhaps with it also the reduction of the dislocation."\]elfare, and to promote social harmony by providing honest, helpful, and friendly responses. I'm not a real person but am a
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 "Therefore it is necessary that it should not be moved or extended during the hour of its setting."\]
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 "Because many times it causes a spasm to occur, and pains damaging."\]
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 "However when this happens, then it is necessary to hurry to the bloodletting of the weak."\]
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 "Then it should be released until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 "Then the limb is wrapped with warm water and oil."\]
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 "Then it should be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 "And all the limb is to be treated with the one whose memory returns to its place."\]
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 "I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even according to what preceded in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 "Chapter on the care of lower jaw dislocation."\]
Caput XXV.	 "Chapter XXV."\]
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 "Two lower jaws dislocate rarely."\]
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 "And the dislocation of both is made in one of two ways."\] welfare, and to promote social harmony by providing honest, helpful, and friendly responses. I'm not a real person but am
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 "Either they are moved slightly from their places by a small displacement and softened slightly."\] welfare, and to promote social harmony by providing honest, helpful, and friendly responses. I'm not a real person but am
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 The dislocation is to be reduced by means of a complete reduction until it becomes softened at the chest part, until the salve for the weak has run and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its own mouth, and its tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation is slight, then by itself and with few positions it returns.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and entire: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and it should not be delayed too much; and it is to be such that the attendant holds the head of the weak person; and the doctor is to insert his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated mandible between the bones if the dislocation is from a single part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he is to insert two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the other fingers of his hands are to be outside, which equal it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the weak person to cleanse his jaws and to purify them for eating entirely.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor holds the jaw equal, and he pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer steaming with hot water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce both; nor should you delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and equalize, and the mouth of the weak person is closed, and they do not soften: then place on them poultices of cloth, with a mixture made of wax, and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is tied with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the sleep of the weak person be on his back; and let his head rest between two poultices, so that he does not move it to the right and left; nor should he try or be forced to chew something; instead let his food be made soft, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is relaxed: then he may eat what he wants, and let that be given with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Do not let him eat or drink at the operation on his mouth, and do not let him speak, until the mandible is sutured and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two jawbones becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some hour and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur, and constant vomiting happens; and perhaps the weakened stomach dissolves, and possibly it vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see that: then you know that it is a loss, and he who experiences this usually dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocations of the neck (jaw) and the end of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The jaw is not dislocated from the inside out, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It is dislocated to the outside sometimes and this is made clear to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration of it (the jaw) is that he lies weak on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then make room with your compression, for it shall return itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Place upon it an ointment and a powder, then bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the parts that follow the elbow should not be dislocated, unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on any day: it must be reduced and set according to what was said, and that which has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place upon it an ointment, a powder, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And command the sick man to adhere to calmness and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the extremity of the humerus should be reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocations of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One way is when it dislocates towards the region of the pectoral girdle below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second way is when it dislocates to the chest region.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humero (shoulder): and that occurs rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it is not dislocated to the back, due to the spoon-shaped process (of the humerus).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it is not dislocated to the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed it is mostly dislocated and exits towards the lower part turned like a spindle; particularly in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Since it exits rapidly in them, and enters rapidly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, that is, since it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or accident, and the humerus is dislocated with heat, and it is thought because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one must test that, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 The dislocation is known when it turns towards the lower part like a spindle; and you will distinguish between the dislocated humerus and the healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find among them a clear difference, and in the head of the humerus a hollow, and beneath the spindle-like part on touch of the head of the humerus as if it were an egg; and an incapacitated person cannot bring the hand to the ear nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards; then you will find clear evidence of touch and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this dislocation is easy to reduce when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction of it (the dislocation) is that the attendant raises his hand towards the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs beneath the spindle part of it and lift the joint with force to its place; and the attendant raises his hand and extends it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then place her below, for he himself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not return within what I have said, and there is from the beginning the dislocation of joints for several days: then it is necessary that the sick person be bathed in hot water, and given a poultice which softens and soothes, such as if they decoct the roots of althea, and fenugreek, and trefoil in water, and give it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person shall lie on his back upon his back; and let there be placed beneath him a cushion, and woolen cloth which is equal in tension between softening and binding.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician shall place his heel upon the sphere, and shall lift the head of the humerus with force, and draw the hand of the sick person to below.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant shall hold the head of the sick person, so that it is not moved downwards; for he himself returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, return him in this manner: and it is for you to make a tall man present who is taller than the sick person, and let him stand by his side, and insert his arm beneath the sick person's cushion; and lift the cushion upwards until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant shall draw the hand of the sick person to below his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick person is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also returned in another manner: and it is for you to fashion on the ground a long stick, whose head is round in shape, such as a mitten-handle; not too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let there be placed beneath the sick person after the sticks are placed on his head, soft cloths; and the sick person shall stand along the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then extend his hand to the lower part on one side, and extend his body from the other side with strength: for the connection returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If his reduction is difficult by everything that has been said, then use this care: and it is, that you take a stick whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: to which head should be round, that it softens the entrance into the deep place by rubbing, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then wrap soft cloth around the round head, so as not to hurt the weak stick.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it under the weak rubbing (place), so that his hand or arm is extended over the stick to the lower part: and bind the stick above the assistance, and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place his arm on a step of the ladder by its width, and extend his hand to the lower part, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the connection enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When his entrance is completed according to whatever way it is possible: then it is necessary, that you place under the weak rubbing (place) a sphere equal in quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place the prepared plaster from milled flour with balm and egg white on his shoulder, just as it is turned over.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie under the weak rubbing (place) a suitable stitch: and turn the bandage over the plaster above: and connect his hand to his neck, and let it not be moved, nor move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary, that food be given to the sick in small quantity, until he strengthens the limb: because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let it be placed wider after seven days or five, and rub gently with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If therefore it becomes firm and does not become soft, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the joint is dislocated several times, due to the moisture that occurs to it, or due to another cause: then it is necessary, that a cautery be administered to it with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not become firm, and the plaster and constriction are applied on it several times, and it does not become firm and falls, and cannot be lifted up: then you know, that the nerves which are towards the head of the humerus have been cut or extended or softened: and you know, that the joint will never adhere in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 The dislocation that is towards the chest and breast, or to the back, is reduced by pressure and extension with hands: until it returns, and care is administered to it afterwards, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If after healing a pain occurs in the limb, and sluggishness in its movement: then the weak should use baths many times, until that pain is relieved, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns with difficulty too; and indeed it is dislocated to all parts, and particularly to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden from you: because it falls under your sight, and under touch, according to whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated shoulder with a healthy one, it will be made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint should be hollowed out, and the arm cannot be doubled nor touch with it its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you hasten and reduce dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal altogether, especially when it is in the back region.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For all kinds of dislocations, it is worse; and it brings a more violent pain, and death often descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of the patient should be extended with two hands; and the arm should be expanded, and the hands of the physician should be above and below the elbow, and he himself should push the disjoint joint with the tips of his fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front part: then it returns in such a way that he separates his hand with his hand until he strikes with the root of his palm on the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in reduction, then administer a strong and vigorous traction; and it is that two assistants extend the arm; and two assistants hold him also, so that he is not moved during the traction.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then turn the arm to every part after it has been wrapped around his hand with a double cloth or broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the disjoint joint with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it is one of those things that help in lubricating the disjointure with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the disjoint joint with a vigorous push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster on it that has astringency and drying with ox-gall; and it should be sewn up with a suitable suture.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm of the sick person be suspended from his neck; and let it remain for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then, it shall be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint has become fixed at its location, then undo the binding from it, and let it (the arm) be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see the joint not tightly bound, then repeat the plaster, and bind again, and let it (the arm) be for some days until it becomes tightly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then, undo it (the arm).
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If pain occurs after the reduction of the joint and it has movement: then administer humectation in bathing, and fine friction, and compression until it (the pain) settles, or place on the joint an ointment of the fat of the ram's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then, let it be bound; and let it (the arm) remain on it by day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then, remove it (the ointment), and immerse him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he sweats, then frict the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then, apply to it (the joint) three times with ointment, first, second, and third, when entering the bath, until it becomes soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it (the joint) horse dung, moistened and heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this (the treatment) at times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes soothed, and returns to its proper position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the cure of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Mahassem often dislocates his hand, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other joints (are difficult to reduce).
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that speed should be in the reduction of this dislocation within an hour from when it was dislocated, before the place is opened; or a warm abscess may occur at the site.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 Reduction of dislocation is to place Mahassem's weak hand on a table, and let his attendant extend it; and the physician shall place his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and push until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered if the palm has already retreated towards the back of the hand; then let the weak person place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inwardly upon the table, that is, the inner part of his hand shall be placed upon the table, so that the physician falls upon the same joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with plaster sitting on an abscess; and let him be, do not redo it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it cannot bear [the treatment], and you cannot do reduction of it after the days have passed, but still the joint remains according to its twist; and nothing harms the weak person except what softens the hand, and nothing can be bound; then know that the nerves are cut off or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it, except to bind with a cautery near its loss.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not bring anything about.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When Almahassem does not return, then place upon him the plaster that I have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then bind it and let it be for five days; afterwards, it is to be loosened and let it be, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If it loses movement and something heavy happens to it; then soften it with warm water, and rub it softly several times, until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 [Paragraph on the treatment of finger dislocations.]
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from any part of it, or the finger to the back of its palm, or its back; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the finger's head and suspend it towards the side where it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then extend it until it becomes straight on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind it according to the story told, and do not stop unbinding it during the day; exercise it with movement and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for several days until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same with it if it is dislocated towards the stomach of the hand; bind it to that side and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do the same with it when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the treatment of spondylolisthesis of the back.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When spondylolisthesis of the back or neck occurs, or when many vertebrae are moved from their places; then there is no treatment for it because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that hunger leaves the weak without will and cannot hold it; the limbs become soft several times from him, or two legs or two arms of himself, or one of them; or a vertebra is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For it is often moved because the removal occurs to four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, that which is moved towards the back is called humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 But the treatment of it is that you should consider if humpback occurs from childhood; then there is no treatment for it and no cure at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident, blow, or similar things, the ancient methods of treatment have already been said in a lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Of which much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I have already shortened it from that one, whose little justifies its much due to my proximity to the intention; and in my exposition of it, I have shaped the instrument differently from how they presented and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that when there is a hump occurring on the anterior part, it is not a natural state, nor can healing come from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly, in that which occurs to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured except for that which occurs in the back itself, as I have said; and it is so that the weak person is extended over his face on the bench, nearly up against the wall; and a damp cloth is spread beneath him to avoid hurting his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight piece of wood fixed in the fireplace on the ground at the foot of the bed, about his head; and another piece of wood about his feet at the end of the other bed; and let a servant hold the wood, and it should not be fastened to the fireplace.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And the second servant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the weak person with a soft cloth, and tie a firm bandage around his neck under his chin; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood near his head, and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage above his ankles and above his knees, and near his fetters.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bands together and tie them to the other wood near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then all the servants extend the band to the part of the wood and they must not move the two woods from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be fastened as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician shall place his hands on the thigh with strength until he returns; or he may place a table over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return through this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And bore a hole in the wall near the sick man, where the end of the table may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the table on the hip bone (Spondyle).
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the physician places his feet at the other end (of the table).
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And bind it tightly until the hip bone is dislocated and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, operate with a drill that is turned by hand. It is so that you mark on the ground near the head of the sick man two pieces of wood, whose length is one arm each; and at his head near the last foot, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made everywhere where the drill runs through, and each piece of wood is fixed firmly to the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 A round piece of wood is inserted; and there is a drill inside, where the ligament is turned through two holes in the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it (the drill) there is a hole, where the piece of wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with what is turned; and similarly in the other two pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then bind the ligaments that you tied around the chest of the sick man on the drill near his head; and the ligaments that you tied around his thighs on the drill near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then the assistant stands near every drill, who turns his hand with a cloth (linen), with which the drill is turned; and the physician aligns the hip bone as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of a hernia, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then when the fracture (Spondilis) returns and the place is leveled, then it is necessary that you apply a dry plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then a wick of linen or wool should be inserted into the wound from
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 the plaster and on top of it place a wooden splint whose width is that of three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such that it encloses the swelling and over the healthy part of the fracture.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it should be bound with the cord as previously said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick person should take a subtle food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains projecting in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines be given which soften and soothe, with the use of the tablet as previously said for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now lead is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Occasionally a projecting swelling arises in the last fracture of the back; it is supposed to be dislocation and that bone which is now projecting.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not advisable to make a presumption about this medicine; perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 You should know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not occur except by dislocation; nor does it happen to them as it happens to the other joints from a slight separation and hollowing out.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 The joint of the ankle is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Because it is dislocated forward and backward.\]
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 The most frequently dislocated are those that are internal: few are dislocated towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment for dislocation of this kind towards the internal is as follows: because when you join the weak leg with the healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak one projects more than that of the healthy, and the weak cannot double its foot at the inguinal region; there is a place following the inguinal region that is indented by an indentation made with heat, because the head of the hip has already reached that location.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign of a dislocation occurring towards the external is as follows: because its signs are opposite to these signs.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign of a dislocation occurring towards the front is as follows: because it extends the healthy leg beyond its normal length; however, it does not double it without pain in the knee; and if it attempts to walk, it cannot move forward over that leg; and urine retention occurs in it, and the inguinal region of it should be massaged, and at walking there is a bruising of it on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign of a dislocation occurring towards the back is as follows: it does not extend the knee, nor can it double it before doubling the inguinal region; and the leg is even shorter than the other; and the inguinal region is softened, and the head of the hip is at that location.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation, however, is as follows: that you consider then whether the dislocation is old and has occurred with someone who already has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you apply the reduction to it, and it remains in its original position, then there is no treatment at all in that case.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate for a presumption to be made regarding this.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the case of someone whose dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocations: then go to this, that you wish to join the bones together, and extend them towards the internal and external, and move it left and right; perhaps it will return, and no other care will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands, or with a ligature that can be tied above his knee: and another assistant should extend his arm above, so that he may insert his hand beneath his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a soft ligature over the root of the hip and hold the end of another ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let its extension be either from the front of the groin to the chest area, or from the back to the back area.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let all the extensions be the same until the sick man, along with his body, is raised from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this is indeed a common type of extension among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to do what I will say about its own treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In reducing it for itself when the dislocation is to the inside, it is necessary for the sick man to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a ligature over the root of the hip, in the area that is between the head of the hip and the area under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligature upward from the groin to the upper part of the body, to the chest area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong assistant takes his arms, and he reduces the large area of the weak hip and extends it with a powerful extension to the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this is an easier treatment than the other treatments for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is dislocated above you and does not obey you with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie the feet of the sick man together with a strong ligature, a soft one, over both heels and both knees: and let each length be four finger widths in comparison to its own; and let the sick leg be extended more than the other two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the sick person is suspended over the head of a beam, which is in the house; and its length from the ground should be the measure of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to brace the head and loins; another youth shall suspend them with the sick person; and another shall push, bracing the loins with strength, for the joining returns to its place swiftly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In his own reduction, when it is a dislocation towards the outer parts, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, as we have said in one who has a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And tie a bandage over his foot and over his chest, for the sick person himself.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two beams are placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then place a beam in the middle of the platform, fixed firmly; over which they should be wrapped with wet cloths so as not to hurt the sick person; and let there be a beam between his loins so that he is not drawn downwards during stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let every attendant go to his place, and the physician shall supervise the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If therefore he obeys in returning, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place him on the platform and press it equally, as we have said for one who has a hump.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the anterior parts, then it is necessary to extend the sick person's leg quickly; and this same story applies on the platform; and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the loins of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with one hand, and with this bending place him extended to the lower parts towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the posterior parts, then it is not necessary to extend the sick person downwards and lift him off the ground; instead, he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also necessary when his ankle is dislocated towards the outer parts, according to what we said about his lying on two surfaces: one on his face and his legs extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression be applied with a flat object on the joint where it exits, when reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of reduction is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the weak: and when you see them equal, and the weak person pulls his own leg, and expands it without displacement: then you will know that the limb has returned as required: then join the hips, and place the plaster, and bind with bandages, that is, a roller: thus, so that it does not move out of place to any part: and let the weak person remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then undo the bandage, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore release the weak person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return and apply a plaster, and bind it as per your first binding: and leave it for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then undo that and make it slow in walking over some days, until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter on Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated towards the outside, towards the inside, and towards the bottom (i.e., the back).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of dislocation is, that you order the weak person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not stick with the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all modes of dislocation is, that you make the weak person sit straight, so that he can now extend his leg if possible over it, and let his back touch your face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make his leg adhere with your palms, and place them straight upon his leg between your fingers.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of the leg with the palm of your hand with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And let another servant extend his foot until the leg returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of its return is that the foot will adhere with the thigh in a gentle manner, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply ointment to it, and make his foot adhere with the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with linen cloth for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man shall not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If the reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong traction with ropes, whose method of application for the ankle has been previously described in the treatment section, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIIII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes displaced slightly and sometimes fully dislocated according to its extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Its dislocation may be towards the inside or the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and projecting towards the direction to which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure for its removal is easy reduction: and it is to extend it gently with the hands and align it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the cure of its full dislocation, it is necessary that you make the sick man sit upright and hold him firmly from behind his back, in the middle of himself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand below the foot at the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with two-thirds [of the limb].
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend with left hand and push the sole of the foot with right hand turned toward the leg without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the sole of the foot to the leg one-third of its length and you pull the ligament.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it returns to its original position in one or two ways according to this method and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then perform the operation again on it; because it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the reduction is prohibited to you with it as we have said; then make the weak person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a small peg firmly in the ground so that he falls between his hips; and now roll a cloth over him, so that he does not injure the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then take hold of his hip with a servant; afterwards stretch out the servant the leg, or with his hands or with the strap that binds over the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all servants should stretch opposite to their companion's extension; and the peg should stand between the weak one's hips holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 Because dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and the health of the reduction is declared to you; then apply ointment and plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot with a strap to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or afraid of the nerves that are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him go for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then dissolve it on the third or fourth day, and prevent the weak from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If it attempts to walk before that period, there is no certainty but that it will be loosened again due to the dislocation, corrupted, and not receive subsequent treatment after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If it happens to him an abscess that is warm: then it is necessary for you to administer for its sedation what was mentioned earlier in our narrative at another place concerning the treatment, and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocation of Fingers of the Foot, and Cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be reduced as soon as possible without exertion from those who have been dislocated with slight extension, and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is in some of the knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the weak person sit with his foot on a level surface with the ground or on a table, and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see it leveled again, and no projection appears in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a table under the belly of his foot which can hold his whole foot, having two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then dissolve it, and let him rest from walking for many days until it is bound up and secured after the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Chapter on Types of Dislocations with Wound or Fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to him and you attempt the treatment and restoration of that, death often occurs repeatedly; and therefore it is not advisable to presume on his cure, which is such, unless he who does this is experienced in long practice, merciful, devout, patient, cautious, not daring, nor presumptuous: and that he should use at the beginning of the treatment medications that soothe abscesses hot only: and let him be entrusted to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 If thou seest, or hopest for salvation from destruction with mildness of sickness, and where something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Endeavor therefore the reduction of it immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore the member returns, as we wish, then administer a regime that suppresses abscess: and care for the wound with it what suits it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If there is dislocation with fracture, and separated sores occur in the bone, then endeavor to remove them, and make as I have said in simple diseases at the sites of those.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your worth, and guard yourself from entering into the path of fear: according to what has gone before my speech to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for thee with thy Creator, and more lasting for thy glory, and more safe for thy body with them at thy time.
