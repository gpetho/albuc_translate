Chapter Six:
On the Cauterization of Torticollis
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only of the types caused by phlegm, as we have said in the sections on diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or from nerve spasm.
When you treat that type of torticollis with cups, head purges, and other treatments, and it does not improve, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third near the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery iron at the right of the uppermost part of the ear, a little above the horn of the head, and at the temple on the other side, the length of which is about the length of a thumb, and apply your hand with the cautery iron until it burns about half the thickness of the skin.
This is the form of the cautery iron, and it is a type of surgical knife, the form of which is set out beforehand.
However, it is more subtle when it is slightly like this; and the knife should be slightly thicker than usual.
Then treat the spot with the remedy mentioned earlier until it is healed.
