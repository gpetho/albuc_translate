of the flesh that grows on the pupil
In the eyes of some men sometimes grows a red flesh, and covers the pupil and presses on the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate blossom; and the procedure is that the patient puts his head on your lap, then you open his eyes, and lift all this flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly; then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with the scalpel until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process; and let the incision be with the spatumile that we mentioned in the incision of the pterygium and with small forceps with which one removes the speck, as the diagram after this chapter demonstrates; and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or instill red eyewash and similar corrosive medications, and place on the outer eye cotton with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess; and if anything remains, and the hot blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess; then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this way. 
But nevertheless, you must alleviate the treatment of every weak eye in a natural way; and in the case of an accidental cause, by working with iron; and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that this member is able to tolerate that procedure.
