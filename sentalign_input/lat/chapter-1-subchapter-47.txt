On the method of cauterizing for leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly aided by cauterization.
Especially the type of leprosy that arises due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; when you decide to cauterize, consider this.
If the leprosy is in the early stages, and you have treated it as we described in the section, but it does not spread or subside, and you fear it might affect the entire body, then cauterize him with five cauteries on the head: one in the center of the head at a marked point, a second lower towards the forehead at the hairline, two on either side of the temples, and one at the nape of the neck.
Hold your hand with the cautery for a brief moment, until it leaves a small mark on the bone and the scabs peel off, to ease the release of thick vapors from there; also cauterize over the spleen, as previously mentioned.
However, if leprosy has spread over the patient and is clearly visible, then apply the cauteries as we described on the head, one on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, a large one on the sacrum at the base of the spine, one just above it, two on the hips (one on each hip), two on the knees (one on each knee), two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the softer parts of the chest; cauterize every joint, including the joints of the fingers of both hands and feet; also cauterize on every heel and the backs of the hands.
Be cautious of the nerves located at the back of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Sometimes, cauterize over the pubic bone, another over the stomach, and another over the liver.
Know that the more cautery you apply, the more it will aid and contribute to healing.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
The cauteries should be sized according to the limbs and joints, as was previously mentioned regarding the types of instruments.
Then treat the cauterized area with an herbal flour mixed with honey and follow the remaining treatment until it heals.
