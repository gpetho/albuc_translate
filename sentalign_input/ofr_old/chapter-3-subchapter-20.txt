Of the calluses that form on the joint
Often, after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, a callus forms, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and it may not be able to perform its natural functions.
So, if the callus is fresh: apply styptic medicines to it, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, either one of these or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or honey; and apply them to the callus with padding, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; then unbind it, and apply another, until the callus is removed; or apply a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings on the limbs; and if the callus has already turned hard like a stone, and it is necessary to remove it, cut it off on top, and slice off the apparent excess; or scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
