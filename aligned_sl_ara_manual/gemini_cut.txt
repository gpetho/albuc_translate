The author of this book said: When I had completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, done by hand.
Because surgery in our country and in our time is totally nonexistent, so that its science has almost been forgotten and its trace obliterated. وإنّما بقى منه رسوم يسيرة فى كتب الأوائل قد صحّفته الأيدى وواقعه الخطاء والتشويش حتّى استغلقت معانيه وبعدت فائدته.
So I decided to revive it and compose this treatise by way of explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and to include illustrations of cauteries and other surgical instruments, as this adds to the clarity and covers what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled surgeon in our time is because the study of medicine is long, and its practitioner should first train in the science of anatomy which Galen described. حتّى يقف على منافع الأعضاء وهيآتها ومزاجاتها واتّصالها وانفصالها ومعرفة العظام والأعصاب والعضلات وعددها ومخارجها والعروق النوابض والسواكن ومواضع مخارجها.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practice of surgery.  We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned regarding anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people, as I have witnessed many who dabbled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or understanding.
For I saw an ignorant physician incise a scrofulous tumor on the neck of a woman, and he severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician proceed to extract a bladder stone from an old man; the stone was large, and he acted rashly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder wall. فمات الرجل الى نحو ثلاثة أيّام، وكنت قد دعيت الى اخراجها فرأيت من عظم الحصاة وحال العليل ما قدّرت عليه ذلك.
I saw another physician who was earning a living from some of the police chiefs of our city by practicing medicine.
A black boy who was with him experienced a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bandaged the fracture over the wound with compresses and splints, binding it tightly and leaving no ventilation for the wound.
Then he indulged his desires, then left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage.  Thus, his leg and foot swelled, and he was near death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief and his pains lessened, except that the corruption had taken hold in the limb, and I could not turn it back.
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.
And I saw another physician treat a hard, cancerous tumor.  It ulcerated after a few days until the affliction of its owner worsened. This is because, if the cancer is purely from black bile humor, it should not be touched with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely amputated.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work accompanied by damage in most cases.
And I have pointed out, in every place where it occurs in this book, any procedure that involves risk and danger, so you should beware of it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, adopt resolution and precaution for yourselves, and gentleness and deliberation for your patients.
And employ the best path leading to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to treat.
And keep yourselves from anything you fear might bring suspicion upon your religion and your worldly life, for it is more preserving of your honor and more elevating of your status in this world and the next.
Galen said in some of his advice, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called bad physicians.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with caustic medication, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments and cauterizing irons, and everything needed for the manual operation.
The Second Chapter.
On incision, and scarification, and phlebotomy, and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and all similar things, organized and arranged, and illustrations of the instruments.
The Third Chapter.
On bone-setting, and dislocations, and the treatment of sprains, and similar things, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization.
And before we mention the operation of it, it is necessary that we mention the manner of its benefits and its harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that the discussion on the manner of the benefit of cauterization and its harms is a long discussion and a precise science and a hidden secret, and a group of the wise have spoken on it.
And they differed on it, and I have summarized from their words the little, fearing lengthiness.
And I say that cauterization is beneficial, in general, for every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, and they are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed regarding it, so some of them said that cauterization is beneficial for it, and others said the opposite of that, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible for someone to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy, and the one who says the opposite of that said that cauterization with fire could benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. لأنّك متى اضفت بدن الانسان ورطوبته الى مزاج النار اصبت بدن الانسان باردا.
And I say what he said, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that no one should imagine that matter except one who has been trained and practiced in the field of cauterization extensively. ووقف على اختلاف مزاجات الناس وحال الامراض فى انفسها واسبابها واعراضها ومدّة زمانها.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially cold, wet diseases, for all the physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed regarding the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization by fire, and its advantage over cauterization by caustic medication is because fire is a simple substance whose action does not go beyond the cauterized organ, nor does it harm another connected organ except slightly.
And cauterization with caustic medication, its action may extend to further organs, and perhaps it causes in the organ a disease whose treatment is difficult, and perhaps it kills. Fire, due to its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that unless it is excessive.
And this has become clear to us through experience due to long service and care in the craft and observation of the realities of the matter.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, and were it not unbefitting of this book of mine, I would have presented to you regarding fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative words too subtle for your understanding.
And know, my sons, that they have differed on the time suitable for cauterization, and they considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization may be suitable at all times, because the harm occurring due to the time is absorbed in the benefit that is brought about by cauterization. ولا سيّما إن كان الكّى من اوجاع ضروريّة قويّة محفدة لا تحتمل التأخير لما يخاف منها أن يعقب ببلية هى اعظم من يسير الضرر الداخل من قبل الزمان.
And do not let enter your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cauterization which heals from a certain illness will not have a recurrence ever, and you consider it blameworthy.
And the matter is not as you imagined, because cauterization is just like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the occurrence of pains.
Except that cauterization is superior to medicine due to the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.
And the illness may possibly return sometime, depending on the patient's temperament, the rootedness of his illness and its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of excess humors within it and his negligence of himself in acquiring them from foods and other similar causes.
However, unless the illness for which cauterization is used is a mild illness and in an organ with little excess humors and moisture. مثل كّى الضرس عن الوجع ونحوه فقد يمكن أن لا يعود فيه ذلك الوجع وذلك يكون فى الاقلّ.
As for the common people's saying that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct statement, but not in the way they mean, because they believe that no treatment is useful, neither with medicine nor with anything else, after cauterization has been performed, but the matter is otherwise.
The meaning of cauterization being the last resort of medicine is that when we use various types of treatment for a disease, and those medications do not work, then we lastly use cauterization and it is effective, thus from this it has come about that cauterization is the last resort of medicine. لا على المعنى الذى ذهب اليه العامّة وكثير من جهّال الاطبّاء.
The ancients have mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderateness of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the site of cauterization does not suppurate, but this is not absolute.
Because I have tested that and found it to do so only in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and finer than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron of gold in the fire, it will not be clear to you when it is heated to the degree that you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it cools quickly, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and flows, so the craftsman finds himself busy with that, therefore cauterization with iron is faster for us and closer to correctness for the procedure, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization in sections that I have organized from head to foot to facilitate for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
The First Chapter.
On cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is useful for an excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches and an abundance of discharges from the head toward the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat aches. وبالجملة لكلّ مرض يعرض من البرودة كالفالج والصرع والسكات ونحوها من الامراض.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the ill person to vomit with a laxative medication that cleanses the head for three or four nights according to what the strength of the sick person, their age, and their constitution requires.
Then you order them to shave their head with a razor, then you have them sit cross-legged in front of you, having placed their hands on their chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the bridge of their nose, between their eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery iron, which is pictured here.
Expose [an area] of the bone the size of a probe head or a cherry pit; then lift your hand. Otherwise, reapply your hand with the same iron or another if it has cooled down. حتّى ترى من العظم ما ذكرت لك ثمّ خذ شيئا من ملح فحلّه فى الماء وشرّب فيه قطنة وضعها على الموضع واتركه ثلاث ايّام.
Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the eschar from the cautery falls off. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They have said that as long as a wound remains open and suppurates, it is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin down to the bone and holding the cautery until part of the thickness of the bone is burned, then scraping away the burnt bone and then treating it.
Others have said that one should cauterize extensively until it has a strong effect on the bone so that a piece like a carat or a small coin falls off the bone. They claimed that this ventilates the vapors of the head from that place and they leave the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not recommend these two types of cautery at all, except in some people and in a risky way, and leaving it alone is better in my opinion and safer if it can be done.  For the head is weakened when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other limbs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and the patient has been suffering from it for a long time, and has used clysters, and head medicines, and snuffs, and ointments, and bandages, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of that has benefited him, then consider the following. فإن كان رأس العليل قوّى البنية بالطبع ولم يكن ضعيفا وكان يجد بردا شديدا فاكوه كيّة أخرى فوق تلك قليلا.
The cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is its picture.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraines.
If pain occurs in a fissure in the head with a headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then have the patient vomit with medicines that purify the head, and use all other treatments that I mentioned in the sections on diseases. If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. إمّا الكىّ بالدواء الحادّ المحرق وإمّا بالحديد.
Cauterization with a burning medication is as follows: take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tighten a bandage over it tightly, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then loosen it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Apply cotton dipped in fat to it until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  And if you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medications that I presented in the eighteenth chapter on burning medications.
As for cauterizing it with iron, it is done in this way: Heat the cautery iron, which is pictured here:.
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, somewhat domed and with a small protuberance in its center.
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while turning the iron little by little, and the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be about half. وترفع يدك لكيلا تحرق الشريان الذى من اسفل فيحدث النزف، ثمّ تشرّب قطنة فى ماء الملح وتضعها على الموضع وتتركه ثلثة ايّام.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like tip of the cautery, taking care not to sever the artery in this migraine, especially if it is not chronic.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of Chronic Migraine.
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases and the treatment is not successful, and you see from the illness that it is not sufficiently treated by the aforementioned first cauterization with medication or cauterization by fire. فينبغى أن تحمى المكواة السكّينيّة حتّى تبيضّ بعد أن تعلّم على موضع الوجع بخطّ طوله نصف اصبع او نحوه وتترك يدك مرّة واحدة وانت تشدّها حتّى تقطع الشريان وتبلغ نحو العظم.
However, you must be careful to avoid touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause convulsions.
And be cautious and attentive regarding the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in severing it. ولا سيّما لمن جهل ما يصنع ولم يكن دربا مجرّبا وترك العمل اولى.
And the management of bleeding arising from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing. If you see a condition that this cauterization does not address...
And if you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head, as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial hemorrhage with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
On Cauterizing Earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery iron called "the point," which is pictured here.
Then, after heating it, cauterize with it around the entire ear, as you would circle it, or around both ears if the pain is in both. وتبعد بالكىّ من أصل الأذن قليلا بعد أن تعلّم الموضع بالمداد ويكون الكىّ قدر عشر نقط فى كلّ أذن او نحوها ثمّ تعالج المواضع حتّى يبرأ إن شاء الله.
Chapter Six.
On Cauterizing Lockjaw.
Lockjaw that is treated with cautery is only of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
Avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of lockjaw with irrigations, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, it is appropriate to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations. واحدة عند أصل الأذن والثانية أسفل قليلا من صدغه والثالثة عند مجتمع الشفتين.
And make your cauterization on the side opposite the diseased side, because the relaxation will occur on the side that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Bring down your cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery, and it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has been presented previously, except that it is a little finer, as you see. وينبغى أن يكون السكّين فيه فضل غلظ قليلا، ثمّ تعالج الموضع بما تقدّم ذكره حتّى يبرأ إن شاء الله.
Chapter Seven
On cauterization for chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned and your treatment has not been successful and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations. على كل قرن من رأسه كيّة وكيّة فى وسط الرأس كما ذكرنا وكّيّة فى موخّر الرأس على ما تقدّم.
The description of the cauteries is as above.  He may also be cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective. Then treat as above.
Chapter Eight
On cauterizing for forgetfulness.
That which is from phlegm, it is necessary that the ill one first be given the major electuaries and the pills that purify the brain.
Then his entire head is shaved, and a mustard plaster, written about in the chapter on plasters, is applied to his occiput several times. This is a type of cautery.
And do this in the exact order which I have mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then fine. Otherwise, cauterize him three times on the occiput, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger, then treat the cauterization as described previously.  If you want to increase it, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle cauterization.
If you want to increase it, cauterize him on the two horns. Then treat him until he recovers.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped, in the form which was described previously.
Chapter Nine
On Cauterizing for Hemiplegia and General Bodily Weakness.
It is necessary to begin by purifying the head with irises and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head. Then cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, a cauterization on each "horn" of the head, and a cauterization on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If you need, in the case of general bodily weakness, more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is severe and persistent, cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. وأبلغ بالكىّ حتى تحرق من الجلد أكثره وترفع يدك ثمّ تعالجه على ما تقدّم ذكره حتّى يبرأ إن شاء الله، وتكون المكواة زيتونيّة.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with strong purgatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the appropriate section, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking the medications.
If, however, he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, he should use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, and then cauterize him with a single cautery in the middle of the head, as described previously in the instructions, and another cautery at the back of his head. وعلى كلّ قرن من رأسه كيّة، فإن كان المريض قويّا وكان محتملا فاكوه الكيّات التى ذكرت فى صاحب الفالج واسترخاء البدن على فقارات العنق وفقارات الظهر، وتكون المكواة زيتونيّة على الصفة التى تقدّمت.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery delicate, in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing for Melancholy.
If the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations that we mentioned for the one who suffers from hemiplegia.
If the cause of melancholy is an excess inclining toward black bile, and the patient's body is moist, then make him drink what purifies his brain, as preceded in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a well-fitted cake of linen, like a circle, then lower it to the middle of his head, with the patient sitting cross-legged, holding it from each side; then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it over the fire with a moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted into it, then empty it onto the middle of his head, within the circle, and leave it until it cools.  Do this to the patient once every week, along with all of his other good regimens, until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted burns without holding your hand on the cautery, rather, it should be a quick touch.  For this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in tallow or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing watery eyes.
If you ascertain the beginning of watery eyes by the signs mentioned in the classification, then hasten to have the patient drink what cleanses his head and protects him from all moistures, and have him sweat in the bath while fasting for several days.
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the beginning of the watering is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cauterize all the veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery iron, and let the cauterizations be the length and width of the temples, and beware of bleeding.
If you see any bleeding, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will discuss the wisdom of incising arteries, cutting them, and guarding against bleeding.
Two deep cauterizations may also be made on the nape of the neck, under the two bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On Cauterizing Chronic Tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and continuous, and are from the veins and arteries that are on the surface of the head, outside the skull, and you are certain that it is from an excess of cold, thick, phlegmatic humors, then cauterize it with the same cautery that I described at the beginning of the falling water section. كيّة فى وسط الرأس وكيّتين على الصدغين وكيّتين فى القفا تحت العظمين وإن احتجت الى زيادة فاكوه كيّة فى كلّ جانب من ذنب العين على طرف الحاجب بمكواة صغيرة.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Cauterizing Nasal Putrefaction.
If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment has not been successful, then hasten to give the ill patient colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize him with the middle cautery using the olive-shaped cautery iron. ثمّ اكوه بالمكواة المسماريّة كيّتين فوق الحاجبين تحت الشعر قليلا وتحفّظ من الشريان لا تقطعه، وهذه صورة المسماريّة.
Chapter Fifteen.
On Cauterizing Relaxation of the Eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep away from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be along the length of the eyebrow.
And do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron should be of this form.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its lashes turn inward so that they prick the eye, then cauterization is of two types. إمّا الكىّ بالنار وإمّا الكىّ بالدواء المحرق، فأمّا كيّها بالنار فتأمر العليل قبل ذلك أن يترك اشفاره إن كان ممّن ينتفها حتّى تطول وتستوى.
If they prick him as they grow, you bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  When they have grown and become even, place the patient’s head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an ace of spades.
The beginning of the mark should be close to the lashes.  Then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium, then heat an iron cautery, the shape of which is this.
Then cauterize on the shape that you marked, little by little, in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the ace of spades, is entirely burned, especially its surface. And the sign of your work being correct is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has lifted away from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with fat to it until the eschar comes off. Then treat it with the ointment until it heals, God willing. If any of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization on that place as you did the first time. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural place and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a caustic medication, you should instruct the patient to leave the lashes alone until they lengthen and become even.
Then make from paper the shape of the ace of spades. Then take some of the usual soap and some quicklime, a dirham's weight or so of each one, then grind them together thoroughly. Do this quickly, lest it dry. ثم تبسط منه على الكاغد الذى صنعت كهيئة ورقة الآس وتضعه على جفن العين الواحدة او الاثنتين وتضع تحت العين قطنة مشرّبة فى بياض البيض ورأس العليل فى حجرك.
Place your index finger on top of the medication and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels the stinging of the medication, because it will feel like a burning fire. As long as he feels the stinging, leave the medication on and move it with your finger. When the stinging stops, remove the medication and wash the eye with water.
Look, and if you see that the eyelid has been lifted as it is lifted when cauterized with fire or cut, then [it is done]; otherwise, reapply the medication to the place where the medication did not take effect and did not turn black, until you have completed your work and the eye is lifted. Then place the cotton with the grease on it until the irritation from the burn subsides.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another until it heals.  And it is necessary for you, during the procedure, to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye. If the eyelid loosens after a few days, and we fear something of the hair in the eye...
Then reapply the medication to that specific spot on the eyelid that has loosened, just as you did before, and then treat it until it heals. And this is the shape of the ace of spades.
And know that people's eyes differ in size, small and large, so your cauterization should be according to that. And the correct method is not hidden from someone who has practice in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Cauterizing the Fistula That Appears at the Corner of the Eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You order the ill person to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head in front of you, holding it so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium seed husks on his eyes, then you heat the cautery, which is pictured here.
It is hollowed out like a tube of eagle feathers on one end, which is used for cauterizing, and if you wish, it can be open on the other end, and if you wish, it can be solid like a probe, except that this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then you squeeze the fistula if it is open and the pus comes out of it and you dry it, or if it is not open, you open it and extract its pus, then at that time you place the cautery on it, and it is very hot, and you hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not err or the patient becomes agitated, and the cautery falls on the corner of the eye and ruins it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop, otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if you need to.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with oil to it, and treat it with the desiccating ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply the sharp, corrosive medication to it until the bone is exposed and scrape it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method for cauterizing fistulas mentioned by some of the predecessors is that you treat the site of the fistula by incising it, then you place a thin funnel into the incision itself. This is its image.
And you pour into it the equivalent of a dirham's weight of molten lead, and you hold the funnel firmly in your hand, tight and secure, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead spill into his eye. And it is necessary to put cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
Indeed, the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we mentioned, then fine. Otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and redirect the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be discussed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing a Cleft Lip.
A fissure often occurs in the lip, called the harelip, especially in the lips of children, as it frequently happens. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section on incisions, and the treatment is not successful, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery iron in this manner.
Its concavity should be like the thinness of a knife. Then place it hot, quickly, into the fissure itself, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure. Then treat it with qayruti until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Cauterizing Fistulas Occurring in the Mouth.
If a swelling appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and the flow of pus becomes a fistula, then you treat it but the treatment does not succeed, then you should heat a cautery iron of a size that fits in the fistula.
Then you insert it hot into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its deepest part and its end. You do this once or twice. Then you treat it after that with what we mentioned of the treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops and it heals, then [well and good].  Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the diseased bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing teeth and loose gums.
If the gums are loose because of moisture, and the teeth are loose, and you have treated them with medications and they have not been effective, then place the patient's head in your lap. Then heat the cautery, whose image comes after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
And insert the heated cautery quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand. Then repeat the cautery as many times as you want. Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water.
And he should hold it for a while and then spit it out. The loose teeth will become firm, and the loose gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cauterizing Toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold, or if there are worms in it, and the treatment with medications is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fat is as follows: You take cow's fat and boil it in an iron ladle or in a shell. Then you take cotton and wrap it on the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiling fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then you repeat it several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is as follows: You use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cautery iron which appears in the illustration and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand steady until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.
The pain will go away either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good quality fat, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.  This is an image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you want and according to what is possible. This is a picture of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
If the hemorrhoids are due to phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond to ripening with medications, and you want rapid ripening, then heat the hollow cautery iron, which is depicted here, with both ends open.
So that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization, place it, heated, upon the swelling itself, once and a second time if needed, until you reach the depth of the swelling.  If the swelling is small, then make the cautery the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply to it cotton dipped in fat until what was burned by the fire is gone, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail in the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, then it is necessary for the patient to first be purged with laxative medications, then cauterize him with a cautery in the pit of the throat at the base of the larynx in the depressed area.
Beware of reaching the larynx with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin, then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, profoundly, and the cautery should be nail-shaped according to the description that preceded.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On Cauterization for Diseases of the Lung and Cough.
If the cough and disease of the lung are due to cold humors, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicles in the soft, empty, depressed areas, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be nail-shaped in the form that was described previously. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncture with the cautery that is called the "puncturing cautery," whose form was previously presented in the puncturing for earache. And the punctures should be from thirty punctures to about that number.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he recovers.  A cautery with three prongs can be made in this form, and cauterization with it is faster because you cauterize three cauteries at once with it.  And this is the form of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five
On Cauterization of the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when reduced from its dislocation, so that this becomes a habit for it - it is reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement that occurs, as we have witnessed - then the jaw should first be reduced. ثمّ يستلقى العليل على ظهره او على الجانب الصحيح ثمّ ترفع الجلد الذى فى داخل الابط الى فوق بأصابع من يدك اليسرى إن كان المفصل انخلع الى داخل.
Then you heat the cautery with the two skewers, whose image is this.
Then you cauterize the skin with it until you penetrate it to the other side, and the shape of the cautery mark is four burns, and it may be cauterized with a cautery with three skewers, so the shape of the cautery mark will then be six burns, and the skewers are the thinness of the file.
This is the image of the cautery with the three skewers.
And one may be added to this number, so the burns become eight, then you apply to the burn the crushed cress with salt, then you order the patient to rest and not to move the limb for a while until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, which is rare.
Cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cautery, or many cauterizations by dripping, for the joint will tighten, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and much moisture, so that it puts it out of its temperament, and the discharges to it increase, and it is treated with various kinds of treatment but it does not succeed, then the patient should lie on his back and extend his legs and arms, then you should cauterize him with three cauterizations. كيّة تحت ملعقة الصدر بقدر أصبع بمكواة مسماريّة وكيّتين أسفل عن جنبتى الكيّة الواحدة حتّى يأتى شكل الكيّات مثلّثا وأبعد بينهما لئلّا تجتمع اذا تقيّحت ويكون عمق الكّى قدر ثلثى ثخن الجلد ويكون شكل الكيّات.
like this image, and this size, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach like this image.
And the cautery iron with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle like this image.
And the stomach may be cauterized by spotting, for one who shrinks from this cauterization, which is that you mark points on the stomach to the extent that you desire with ink, then cauterize it with a spotting cautery, then treat it with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and moisture or due to thick wind, so that it deviates excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, but it is not effective. فينبغى أن يستلقى العليل على قفاه وتعلّم بالمداد ثلاث كيّات على هذا الشكل وهذا المقدار بعينه على الكبد أسفل من الشراسيف حيث ينتهى مرفق الإنسان.
And there should be the thickness of a finger between each cautery mark, and the cautery should be lengthwise along the body, straight, and do not press your hand with the cautery iron.
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half of it, no more, and the patient should be standing on his feet; if he is not standing, then he should be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised, and this is the image of the cautery iron.
You can cauterize these marks with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning the entire skin and burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so be aware of it.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On Treating Swelling of the Liver by Cauterization.
If an abscess occurs in the liver and you want to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, then the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, there will be severe sharpness with the pain. If you see that it has exhausted the physicians' treatment, then the patient should lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, which is the cautery that resembles an awl, and this is its image. وتكويه بها كيّة واحدة حتّى تحرق الجلد كلّه وتنتهى بالكىّ الى الصفاق حتّى تخرج المدّة كلّها ثمّ تعالجه بعلاج الخراجات حتّى يبرأ.
This type of cautery should not be used except by someone who has long been trained in the art of medicine, and has experienced these diseases repeatedly. Only then can he proceed with such a procedure. Leaving it [untreated] is, in my opinion, better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Warts.
The ancients mentioned cauterizing cold warts with birthwort roots in this manner: Take one of the longest dry roots of long birthwort that you can find, about the thickness of a finger. Then dip it in oil and set it on fire. ثمّ تكويه كيّة واحدة فيما بين اتّصال الترقوة بالعنق وكيّتين صغيرتين دون الاوداج قليلا مائلة الى الناحية التى تحت اللحية وكيّتين عظيمتين فوق الثديين فيما بين الضلع الثالث والرابع.
And also cauterize twice between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back, and once in the middle of the chest, and once above the stomach, and three times on the back: once between the shoulder blades and twice on the sides of the back below the cauterization that is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burn. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, similar to a probe, and they heated it and inserted it between the ribs until it reached the wart itself.
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors. This reckless cauterization is very dangerous; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that cannot be healed.
Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If you have treated a disease of the spleen with the treatments mentioned in the section on partitioning, and your treatment was not successful, cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One of them is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
in the shape of the liver cauterizations, the form of which has been presented, with the space between each cauterization being the width of a finger or slightly more. The form of the cautery is the same as that mentioned for cauterizing the liver.  Do not insert your hand deeply with the cautery. The patient's position is lying on their back.
The other approach is at the elbow. You lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends. Your lifting of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert the two skewers, very hot, until they penetrate the skin on the other side. Then you remove the cautery, making four cauterizations. If you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery, which has three skewers.
Then treat the cauterization site after you leave it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than all the preceding treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Cauterization for Ascites.
Cauterization is only beneficial in the case of tympanitic ascites specifically. If you have treated the patient with ascites with the various treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and your treatment has not been effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
And another cauterization on the liver and a cauterization on the spleen and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open, draining pus for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary so that it brings together the two meanings, and healing will quickly come to him.  The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped as its image preceded, and the one with which the stomach is cauterized should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the depression between the little toe and the ring finger.
Keep your hand steady with the cautery iron and do not twist it. Then lift your hand and do not bring it back at all, for it will drain the yellow water. The cautery iron should be of this shape:
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be done with the knife-edge of the cautery iron and should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg. And on each thigh, two cauterizations.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water drains from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterization for Diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and humidities, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments and has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is of sufficient strength, then cauterize his stomach with a large cauterization. على ما تقدّم فى كىّ المعدة بمكواة الدائرة وأربع كيّات حول السرّة لطاف بالمكواة المسماريّة اللطيفة وكيّة على القطن فوق العصعص كبيرة او كيّتين.
If you see that the humidities are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids of the Anus.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick cold humors or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment has not been successful, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower vertebrae, slightly below the "table," in a triangular shape.
And cauterize below the navel at a distance of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold, and his food is not being digested, and you see that his face is swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization, as has been described before, and cauterize his liver. وأخرى على طحاله بمكواة مسماريّة واترك الكىّ مفتوحا زمانا ثمّ عالجه حتّى يبرأ إن شاء الله.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Cauterizing Warts.
After cutting them: When you have cut the wart, heat the cautery iron that resembles an awl. Then, insert it hot into the place of the cut wart, and push your hand in deep, until the cautery iron reaches the opening of the vessel from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described. Then, treat them with suitable ointments until they are healed. And if you cauterize them also with a large cautery on the cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On Cauterizing Fistulas that Occur in the Anus and its Surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure that we described in its place and is afraid of it, he may sometimes be healed by cauterization. So, if a fistula develops in someone, and pus and corrupt humors have been flowing from it for a long time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe. Then heat the cautery that resembles the probe. Then insert it hot into the fistula itself, following the direction and depth of the fistula reached by the probe. Repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein, or if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
So be cautious about all these places. You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not deep. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the discharge stops and it remains so for a while, know that it has healed completely.
But if the discharge does not stop, know that it is deep, or that there is corrupt bone at its bottom, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cauterizing the Kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual intercourse diminishes because of that, then it is appropriate to cauterize on the loins, on the kidneys themselves, a cautery on each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery iron that was mentioned earlier.  We sometimes cauterize a third time on the abdomen itself, resulting in three cauteries lined up, which is more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot hold urine, cauterize him with a cautery below the navel, over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and a cautery to the right of the navel, and another to its left.
And the distance after cauterization from each side should be about the width of a thumb joint. Cauterize him with a cautery at the bottom of the back, or two cauteries if needed, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped, as mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Cauterizing the Uterus.
If matter arises in the uterus from cold and humidity, so that it is prevented from conception, and its menstrual flow is corrupted and its discharge is difficult or it causes pain when it comes, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. وكيّة على القطن أسفل الظهر او كيّتين وتكون المكواة مسماريّة.
Chapter Forty.
On Cauterizing Hip Dislocation.
Viscous humors may settle in the hip joint, causing it to be displaced. A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you will find a gap at the site of the dislocation.  The patient should be cauterized right on the hip itself, with a semi-circular cautery.
After marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle. And the cautery iron should be the one whose form was presented in the cauterization of the stomach. If this cautery iron is not available, then cauterize with three burns using the large olive-shaped cautery iron.
Make the cauterization as deep as the entire thickness of the skin. Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
On Cauterizing Sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and humidities, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment was not successful, and it became chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with purging cassia or aloe vera pills, or similar.
Then cauterize him. The method of cauterization is of two types: either cauterization with burning medications or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire is done in many ways. One of them is to cauterize directly on the hip itself, three triangular burns, like this image.
Make them a suitable depth, with a distance between each burn about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery should be olive-shaped.  And it may be cauterized with one burn in the middle at the top of the hip itself, making it four burns. If you wish, cauterize it with the circle which we mentioned previously in cauterizing dislocation of the hip, one burn.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two burns on the thigh at the location where the patient indicates the pain, and one burn above the heel, four fingers up on the lateral side slightly, and the cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicated, with the point cautery, three or four times, or more if needed. And if he indicates pain below the knee, towards the leg, cauterize there, one time, with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn so deeply as to burn a nerve or a large artery, thus causing the patient a serious injury or chronic illness.
I have seen one and a second person who were cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot, and it became entirely perforated, and the entire leg was ruined, and then diarrhea and death occurred afterwards. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in precisely this manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned, regarding cauterization of the hip, a cautery of this description: A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth, the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup, another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each two cups should be about the width of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open on both sides, and their height should be about one or two thumb joints, and an iron handle is made for them, firmly attached to the cups. And this is its image.
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then place it directly on the hip while the patient is leaning on the healthy side, and cauterize him with three circular burns at once, then leave him for three days and dress him with fat, and leave the wound open for several days.
Then treat him with the ointment until he recovers.  The author of this book says: This type of cautery we rarely use because of its ugliness and the dreadfulness of its appearance and because of the few we find who can tolerate it, except that it is good cauterization for those who can bear it and for whom its location is appropriate.
As for cauterization with caustic medications, it is that you make two cups, like the ring in which the door bolt goes down, of copper or of iron.
Their rims should be about two knuckles high, or thereabouts, and the distance between them should be about the thickness of a finger, and they should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and they should be joined together in this way.
Then place them directly on the hip while the patient is lying on his healthy side, and tighten your hand well, then pour between the two circles the strong water, slightly warmed by fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass, and the patient must endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a stinging like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the strong water from the entire hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply fat to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and leave it for days while the pus drains from it, for it is more effective in benefit.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it that holds water, just as you did for the hip, and this is the description of the strong water, and I have included it in the chapter on preparing medications.
Take one part alkali salt and one part unslaked lime, crush them and place them in a new pot which has a single small hole pierced in its bottom, the size of a probe, and place another glazed pot underneath the bottom of the pot.
Pour fresh water over the alkali and lime, enough to cover them by a finger's breadth after you have pressed them down firmly with your hand, and leave the pot until the strong water descends into the bottom glazed pot, then collect all of that water, then pour it over another batch of fresh lime and alkali.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various organs, because it acts exactly like fire.  Among the medications which also cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of spurge flax, and lime with soap, rubbed in.
Galen recounted a story about one of the ancients who treated hip pain and sciatica and greatly praised this treatment, claiming that it needed no other therapy and that it healed in one application.
Such that a person might even be carried into the bath and come out cured.  It is that green stinking hellebore be taken, but if green is not found then take the recently dried, and it is finely ground with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh.
And it is bandaged and left for about three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning sensation subsiding, then he enters the bath. When his body is moist, he enters the basin, then the pain will go away and he will be healed, God willing. If he is not healed, repeat the poultice after ten days.
For he will be healed, God willing. And know that no one should use cautery with these medications except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if cauterized with it on the sciatic nerve, benefits it.
The cauterization is done in this manner: wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot that is between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, and it is closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung.
And ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then take another, and continue to do so until the sensation reaches the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cautery is called dung cautery.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Cauterizing Back Pain.
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It results from an outpouring of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is done only for this type.
That which is from an outpouring of a cold substance, it is necessary, after emptying the patient with حبّ المنتن (habb al-muntin) and the like, to cauterize on their back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the area, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
And the cauterization should be with a point cautery, and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.
Chapter Thirty-Four
On Cauterizing the Beginning of a Hump.
This ailment frequently occurs in young children, and the sign of its beginning in the child is that he experiences shortness of breath when standing and moving, and you will find at the last vertebra of his back a bead that has protruded, elevated above the other vertebrae.
So if you see that, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, in this manner. لتأخذ الكيّة على كلّ جهة من الفقارة باستواء وإن شئت كويته حول الفقارة بمكواة النقطة صفّين او ثلاثة ولتكن النقط قريبة بعضها من بعض ثمّ تعالج الموضع حتّى يبرأ بما ذكرنا.
And be careful not to use cautery on a hump that comes from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Cauterizing Gout and Pains of the Joints.
If the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the physicians' custom to call that specifically gout.
If cold gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the division and the pains do not go away, then cautery will remove them, and that is that you cauterize after emptying around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do it with the point cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints, and this happens often, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you rotate in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them at each knuckle and on the back of the hand.  If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not neglect good regimen and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and expels the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Cauterizing Hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestine and omentum descends into the testicle, and this is recent and of short duration, you should order the patient to abstain from food for the day and use laxatives to bring down the stool from his bowels.
Then he should lie down on his back in front of you and you tell him to hold his breath so that the omentum or intestine protrudes. Then you reduce it with your finger, and then mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a half-circle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat a cautery, this is its image.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks, then you reduce the intestine or omentum into his abdomen. Then an assistant places his hand on the area so that the intestine does not protrude, and you spread the patient's legs apart, placing a cushion under him, and another assistant ties his legs.
And another (assistant) on his chest holding his hands.  Then you apply the cautery on the mark itself, your hand holding the cautery steady and upright, and you hold it until it reaches the bone, or you repeat it again if it didn't reach the bone the first time.
And be very careful of the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, lest you burn it, thus causing the patient either death or a great affliction.  And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then you treat the cauterized area after three days with ghee until the burn scab disappears, then you treat it with various ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you make his food during his treatment something that softens his bowels so that the intestine does not protrude when defecating and excreting.  Then if he wants to get up after forty days, you use a tight bandage and keep it for another forty days, and he should reduce exertion and fullness from food and drink and loud shouting.
For if this procedure is followed thus, he will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing.  As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is incipient, if you want it not to increase, then cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size. وليكن ما تحرق من الجلد مثل ثلثيه ثمّ عالجه بما ذكرنا فإنّه لا يزيد إن شاء الله، وقد ذكر بعض الأوائل أن يكوى الفتق بمكواة مثلّثة على هذه الصورة.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line on the upper side of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you bring down your hand in the middle with a single nail-shaped cautery.  The first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterizing a Callous.
If there occurs in some limb, due to a fall or a blow, a pain, and that pain persists for a long time and treatment with medicines does not work, then it should be cauterized with a point cautery. And the cauterization of each limb should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And the pain and the callus will be located by it. If it heals from the first cauterization, then fine. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on it, because it is the nature of these pains to move from the limb to what is near it, so it is necessary to follow it with the cautery until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you want to cauterize it, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it has not subsided or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's entire temperament, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. الواحدة فى وسط الرأس المعهودة والثانية أسفل منها نحو الجبهة عند نهاية الشعر واثنتين على القرنين وواحدة من خلف على نقرة القفا وأمعن يدك بالكىّ قليلا حتى يؤثّر فى العظم تأثيرا يسيرا.
Scales will peel off from it, which will facilitate the exhalation of thick vapors. Cauterize him also over the spleen itself as previously mentioned. However, if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has manifested clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head. وكيّة على طرف الأنف وكيّتين على الوجنتين وكيّتين على فقارات العنق وستّا على فقارات الظهر وواحدة كبيرة على العصعص عند عجز الذنب وأخرى فوقها فى نفس المائدة واثنتين على الأوراك على كلّ ورك واحدة.
And be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them. One may also cauterize the pubic bone, another on the cardia of the stomach, and another on the liver.  Know that the more you cauterize, the more beneficial and effective it is.
And know that the sick person does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb.  The cauteries should be large and small according to the limbs and joints, as previously mentioned regarding the characteristics of the irons.
Then treat the cauterization with powdered fenugreek with honey and other treatments until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On Cauterizing Numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb itself with cauterizations according to what the size of the limb, large or small, requires.  And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. Some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot may be cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the numbness will go away.
And no one should undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Vitiligo.
If vitiligo becomes chronic and no medical remedy is effective against it, cauterize it with a slight depth, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil, plantain leaves, and pigeon blood or swallow blood, one part of each, mixed together and spread on a cloth, and applied to the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cauterizing Cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it as you rotate. Some physicians have mentioned cauterizing it strongly in the middle, but I do not recommend that because I expect it will ulcerate, and I have seen that happen several times.
The correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cauterizing the Boil.
If someone develops a boil and it is slow to mature, either because of the matter causing it, or because of the patient's age if he is old and has little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the boil's maturation, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, dotting it.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you want to open it with cautery, heat the cautery iron which is pictured here.
And apply it to the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be on the lower side so that the pus can flow easily. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Corrosive Ulcer.
The corrosive ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see the corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization by fire, heat many nail-shaped cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all of the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, then [stop]. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupt areas.  The corrosive ulcer can also be treated with a potent medication.
It takes the place of fire, being faster-acting. I have mentioned its treatment with potent medication in the division, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On Cauterizing Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails.
This ailment often occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man. Cauterization for it is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a potent liquid.
Cauterization by fire is done by heating a hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron, the size of which surrounds the nail on all sides, and having a thin edge. Then you place it hot on the nail, then turn your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days to fester with pus, then you dress it with crushed wild mallow with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will remove it from its roots. Then you treat the wound site with the flesh-generating ointment until it heals if the nails are not ingrown.
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of potent liquid into the tube.
And hold your hand while turning it with a slight squeeze of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the potent liquid finds its way to sink to the base of the nail. The patient should endure the sting of the potent liquid for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will come off by its roots.  This is how you do it one by one until you have removed all of them from the body. Then, after they have been removed, treat their places with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On Cauterizing a Tremor.
If someone experiences tremors from a chill in a nerve or from quartan fever or other causes, it is necessary to cauterize him four or five times on the spinal vertebrae, one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. وعلى معدته كيّة بالمكواة الزيتونيّة فإنّ النافض يسكن ويسرع بنضج المرض البارد.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On Cauterizing Pustules that Occur on the Body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body from cold, thick, and corrupt humors. It is necessary, upon their first appearance, to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited with fire or with the root of long birthwort or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Warts may also be cauterized upon their first appearance in this manner, and they will not grow larger.  The excess matter causing them will dissipate, and the patient will recover. However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has undergone bloodletting.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On Cauterizing Bleeding that Occurs When an Artery is Severed.
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound or during the incision of a tumor or the cauterization of a limb and so on, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the opening of the artery and press firmly until you stop the blood flow beneath your finger so that nothing comes out.  Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and place the cautery on the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cautery there until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that may be there, which would cause the patient further harm. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by severing it, if it has not already been severed. فإنّه اذا بتر تقلّصت طرفاه وانقطع الدم وإمّا أن يربط بالخيوط ربطا وثيقا وإمّا أن توضع عليه الأدوية التى من شأنها قطع الدم والشدّ بالرفائد شدّا محكما.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by tightening with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will not stop at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone, and a doctor or medicine is not available, let him immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
And he should press it very hard until the blood is contained and emerges from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it.  Continuously apply very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops flowing. During this time, consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.
Chapter Two.
On Incisions, and Lancing, and Phlebotomy, and Wounds, and Similar Procedures.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization by fire and burning medication, along with their causes, reasons, instruments, and shapes of the cauteries, and we arranged them in chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will follow in this chapter the same path so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin this, it is necessary that you know, my sons, that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the procedures in this chapter often result in excessive bleeding—the very blood upon which life depends—whether by opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising for a stone, and similar procedures, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most cases, death.
And I warn you against engaging in what is doubtful for you, for you may encounter in this profession all kinds of people with various ailments, and some of them may be weary of their illness and death may be insignificant to them.
Because of the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and their illness shows certain signs of death, while others will offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for recovery while their illness is fatal, so you should not at all assist those who come to you in this condition.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except with certain knowledge that you have of what the good outcome will be, and in all the treatment of your patients, use foreknowledge and forewarning of what the outcome of the treatment will be.
For in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, renown, and gratitude. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of rightness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
I have arranged the chapters of this section, as in the previous section on cautery, from the head to the foot, so that it may be easier for you to find what you want from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of hydrocephalus in children.
This ailment often occurs in children at birth if the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness. It may also occur from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone but children, and all those I have seen have quickly died, so I have seen fit to abandon operating on it.  I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. حتّى لم يطق الصبىّ يقعد على نفسه لعظم رأسه والرطوبة تتزايد حتّى هلك.
This fluid either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone, on the dura mater. The procedure, if the fluid is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that you should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the head. The length of the incision should be about two finger-widths, so that the fluid drains. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the fluid is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions, in this manner:
And if the fluid is under the bone—and the sign of that is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water recedes when you press it with your hand—and that is not hidden from you—then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner:
And after the incision, all the fluid comes out, then you tighten the incisions with bandages and compresses, then you anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then you loosen the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and you nourish the ill one with all dry foods of little moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water has collected, because it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
So direct the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appears to you, then incise it as you are able, and be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient does not die from that bleeding, along with the discharge of fluid.
Chapter Two.
Incision of the two arteries behind the ears known as the hissing ones.
When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or the chest, and this becomes chronic, and drug treatment is ineffective, the most effective treatment in this case is the incision of these two arteries.
So, if you want to incise them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the vessel pulsates, and their two locations are the two lowered areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with the lancet to the bone, and that should be across the head, and if you wish, insert the lancet from under the artery and lift it upwards by cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers.
For when the vessel is severed, the blood comes out in a pulsating gush, spurting forward with repeated spurts.  If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure about three fingers from the ear, then mark with ink and incise to the bone, and what is necessary is to...
Let six ounces of blood flow, on average, and perhaps you will let more or less than that, all according to what you see of the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it away.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then pack the wound with a wick of linen cloths, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On venesection of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraines or severe catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temples' muscles, or a severe chronic headache, and so on, and has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried, for these ailments, venesection of the arteries in the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.
The method of venesection is to shave the patient's hair on the temples and aim for the artery that appears in the temple, as it is evident from its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in some individuals.
Or, in extreme cold, if it is hidden from you, have the patient tighten their neck with a piece of their clothing, then rub the area with a cloth or apply a hot water compress until the artery appears clearly and distinctly. ثمّ تأخذ المبضع الذى هذه صورته.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong, doubled thread. The thread should be either silk or lute strings so that it doesn't decay before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ties. You can do this at that moment or later.  If you wish, you can cauterize it to the bone with a cautery knife until its ends are severed, which serves the same purpose, or even better, as we have said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, cauterization helps to eliminate the humors, so it is more beneficial. After incising the arteries, the area should be packed with aged cotton and secured with bandages. After the release, it should be treated with desiccative medications that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during the procedure, immediately stop it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing your hand until the bleeding stops.  If none of these are available, apply your finger until the blood clots.
Wash the area with very cold water to reduce the inflammation and bandage it as needed.  A gentler and easier method than incising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two spots with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and severs the vessel in two places so that the ends are separated, as they will definitely not rejoin with this cauterization.  This is an image of the cautery.
Its two blades are sharp, resembling small scalpels, though much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they were as sharp as a scalpel, they would cool down too quickly and not cut the flesh quickly. If they are somewhat thick, they retain the heat of the fire.
And it cuts the flesh quickly. This method is better than any other, gentler and easier.  The space between the two blades should be about the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of a constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and nothing from medical treatment with medicines has been beneficial, and you see that the patient's face has reddened. ويحسّ فى جبينه دبيبا كدبيب النمل وعيناه مهزولتان رطبتان قد تأكّلت اشفارهما وتشبّطت اجفانهما من حدّة الدموع فاضطرّت الاوائل فى علاجها الى هذا العمل ويسمّونه العلاج بالسيف، وهو أن تأمر العليل بحلق الشعر الذى فى جبهته.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead, and the length of the incision is about two fingers. One incision is parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second is a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third is on the other side.
And beware of cutting the two arteries that are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  Let the distance between each incision be the width of three fingers pressed together. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry rags with which to wipe the blood.
Then you insert the sharp, two-pointed scalpel, which is pictured here. من الشقّ الذى يلى الصدغ الى الشقّ الأوسط وتسلخ به جميع الجلد الذى فيما بين الشقّين مع الصفاق الذى على العظم ثمّ تفعل ذلك ايضا من الشقّ الأوسط الى الشقّ الثالث ثمّ تخرج هذا المبضع.
And you turn its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, you squeeze the places where the clotted blood has been cut. Then you put in each incision a cotton wick moistened with wine and oil or vinegar and oil, and place a compress on it.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, and on the third day you loosen the bandage and use frequent washing with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and all the other things you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences copious, sharp, pungent, and persistent discharges, and you see their eyes weakened and small, their vision impaired, their eyelids ulcerated, and their eyelashes falling out. ويكون فى عمق الرأس وجع حادّ مؤلم وعطاس متتابع فاعلم من هذه الأعراض أنّ تلك الموادّ والنزلات إنّما تجىء من عروق كثيرة عميقة وأفضل العلاج فيها هذا العلاج، وهو أن تأمر العليل بحلق جبهته ثمّ تشقّ شقّا واحدا فى وسط الجبهة.
And there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from numerous, deep vessels, and the best treatment for them is this treatment:  You order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. او أرفع قليلا بالعرض وتبتدئ بالشقّ من الصدغ الأيسر الى الصدغ الأيمن ويكون الشقّ الى العظم وأبعد يدك عن عضل الصدغين المتحرّكين عند المضغ حتّى اذا انكشف العظم ونشفت جميع الدم بالإسفنج.
Then separate the edges of the incision with absorbent cotton or a linen wick, then bandage over it with compresses soaked in wine and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove the bandage and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the flesh begins to grow in it.
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something like stone, such as iron and glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, kernels, and the like; or a flowing thing, such as water, vinegar, and the like.
Or an animal.  When a pebble or something like a pebble falls into the ear, something that does not grow in the ear, face the sun with the ear. If you see the pebble, drip some violet or iris oil into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing using hellebore. وسدّ المنخرين عند مجئ العطاس بعد أن تضع حول الأذن طوقا من خرق او صوف وتمدّ الأذن الى فوق فكثيرا ما تخرج بهذا العلاج فإن لم تخرج وإلّا فحاول إخراجها بالجفت اللطيف الذى هذه صورته.
If it comes out with the forceps, then good. Otherwise, try to remove it with a smooth, slightly curved, blunt hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube gently into the ear canal.
Seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil so that the air has no passage except through the tube, then draw it out strongly with your breath, and it will often come out with this. If it does not come out with what we have described, then take a little bit of opopanax gum, or the prepared gum that is used to catch birds, and place it on the tip of a probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, insert it gently into the ear canal after drying the ear of moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling or convulsion occurs.
The method of incision is that you first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein and let out blood according to his strength. Then you sit the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the lobe in its lower part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the pebble. Then you remove it with whatever instrument you can, then you quickly sew up the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that swell and expand, try to remove it by what we have mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel like this.
And try to cut that type of grain that has fallen into the ear. You only do this if you are certain that the grain has been moistened by the vapor of the ear so that it becomes many small pieces. Then remove it with the blind hook, or with a delicate forceps, or by suction.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove it.  As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some worn cotton, while lying on the ear that has the water in it. If it comes out with that, [then it is good].
If not, then take many pebbles about the length of the fingers, thin and smooth, and warm them slightly by the fire.  The patient inserts one into the opening of his ear and hops on one foot on that side, and strikes with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
He continues to do this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out.  The water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather and inserting one end into the ear and setting fire to the other end until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this several times until all the water comes out, or draw it out with the tube as mentioned previously regarding the pebble.  As for removing an animal that has entered it, see: if it is small-bodied, like a flea and the like, treat it with what I mentioned in the section; however,
if it is large-bodied and perceptible to the senses, then attempt to remove it with forceps and hooks, and the matter is easier than all that which adheres in the ear.  As for removing worms generated in the ear, if you have treated them with what we mentioned in the section on ear drops in the treatise on drops, and your treatment has not been successful,
it is appropriate to look into the ear in the sun.  If any worms appear to you, then extract them with forceps or delicate hooks.  If none of them appear to you, then take a tube, which is pictured here.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top, insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If it does not respond to removal, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you regarding the pebble.
If they do not come out with what we have mentioned, use the eardrops that I mentioned, which were tested by the ancients for killing worms, and you will find that in the treatise on eardrops.  And your pouring of oils and medications into the ear should be with this instrument, and this is its picture:
As you see, you make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.  And if you wish, the injector that is inside the tube can be of sealed copper.  And if you wish, take a probe and wrap cotton around its tip, wrapping it tightly.
Then put the oil or juice, or whatever of these medicines you desire, into the tube while it is in the ear.  Then insert the probe with the cotton from above, and squeeze it with your hand with a moderate squeeze, until the oil is propelled into the cavity of the ear and is felt.
The patient should feel it entering.  And whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly over the fire.  Beware that the thing that is dropped in it is not extremely cold or extremely hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the openings of their ears unperforated.
Blockage may also occur in some people in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh growing in it, and this blockage may be deep in the ear canal, imperceptible to sight.
It may also occur a little outside the opening and be perceptible to sight. The one that occurs deep in the ear and is imperceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to treat. As for the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun. وتنظر فيها فإن رأيت السدّ ظاهرا فافتحه بمبضع لطيف تكون هذه صورته:.
Its tip should have some slight width, somewhat restricted, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you sense the blockage along with the heaviness of hearing that the patient experiences, pierce it gently.
And beware of injuring the eardrum. Then insert a wick into the ear, the size of the opening, having smeared it with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are certain the wound will not close.  Or take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
And use it.  If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have smeared with a cerate made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use all the other treatments that stop bleeding, which are mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that occur on the eyelids.
These warts that occur on the eyelids may be moist and may be dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel. Then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a gentle lenticular cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting, and they frequently return if anything of their roots remains. If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of coldness occurring in the eyelids.
Often something appears on the eyelids resembling coldness in its intensity and hardness.
And for that reason it is called coldness, and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. The procedure for them is that you examine, and if the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving to every side, then its treatment is easy, so make a horizontal incision on it.
Then peel it from every side gently until it is detached, then lift it with a hook and cut it. If it is not possible for you to cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient at all.  If the incision is large, bring it together with stitching and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm for you from it, for the ointment will repair it and heal it. If the coldness is tending towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and lift the coldness with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it away from every side.
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cutting, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with something that heals, until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of pterygium that occurs in the eyelid.
Pterygium is a small fleshy mass that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most commonly occurs in children, and it makes their eyes heavy, and they experience discharges in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight. من أجل أنّ الدمع يسرع اليهم.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, swollen and puffy, and the pterygium appears clearly. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them.  The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it and make a circle from that wick as large as it surrounds the pterygium from all sides, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the pterygium in the center of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet. The incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the pterygium.
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision like a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it comes free. Beware of extending the incision, lest the lancet slip into the eye and injure it.
If the pterygium does not appear to you at the first incision, you should gently extend the incision a little until the pterygium appears, then pull it out as we have said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it softly. Some people crush salt.
And place it in the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of inverting the eyelid.
If eyelashes grow on the eyelid excessively, unlike the natural way, beneath the natural eyelashes, and persist, they will harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickening, until it causes blindness.
Inverting the eyelid is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the inversion may be by cutting and suturing, or with reeds, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn, then insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself.  Pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
And turn it over with the probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid, below the excess hairs, with the lancet, from the greater angle to the smaller angle. Then pull the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid, because people may differ in this, for some need to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less cutting; all of this depends on the degree of eyelid relaxation. Then incise with the lancet on the two lines that you marked, starting from the greater angle to the smaller angle, and each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the probe.
Then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off.  Then join the two edges with sutures using a needle and fine wool thread. Wipe away the blood and stick down any excess threads on the eyebrows with something sticky.
If you wish to do this, then do so, otherwise don't bother. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, you can leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will lift when the wound closes and joins.  Suturing is better.
This method of lifting I have mentioned from the ancients, except that it is troublesome for the patient, although it is good work and without danger.  There is also another method of lifting, which is to mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described. ثمّ ترفع الجفن بثلاث صنانير تكون مفترقة او مجموعة على هذه الصورة:.
Then cut the excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting evenly:
If you cannot hold the hooks and it doesn't work for you, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger corner and a third thread near the smaller corner.  Gather the threads evenly between your fingers, then lift your hand with a moderate lift.
And lift the entire marked skin as we have described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, soothe that swelling with cerate and similar soothing ointments.
It can also happen that the lower eyelid turns in, and it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, suturing, and cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medication.  Cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medication is more effective and easier on the patient than cutting and suturing, while cutting and suturing are more effective in the other cases.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this way: you turn the eyelid and make the incision on the inside as described, then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid and width less than the width of a scalpel.
Notches are made at their ends on both sides where the threads are held. Then they are gently placed on the excess eyelid and tied firmly from both ends and left there for several days.  Thus, the tightened skin dies, turns black, and decays.
Until it falls off by itself. If it is slow, cut it off with scissors then treat it until it heals.  When it heals, the eyelid will be lifted, and the lashes will not irritate the eye.  This is a picture of the two reeds, made in this shape and this exact size in length and width:.
Chapter Twelve.
On lifting hair irritating the eye with a needle.
If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread. Then, bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot. The length of the thread should be about a span.
Then, attach to the loop another thinner thread, shorter in length, and tie its ends if you wish. Then, have the patient place their head in your lap, close to the sun so that the work is clear, as it is delicate work. Then, insert the needle with the loop at the root of the extra hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then, pull the thread over the loop and insert the extra hair(s) into the loop, whether one, two, or three, no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid, along with the natural hairs. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then replace the hair in it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you can see it clearly. Then, release the loop and thread and remove them. Tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes hold in its place and the flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, you can either add a long natural hair to it so it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, at which point you can lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The condition that causes this ectropion is called "hare eye." This ectropion can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired type results from the healing of a wound, tear, cauterization, or something similar.
The way to treat it is to incise the scar tissue, separate its edges, insert a linen wick between them, and tie it until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.
If you do that, the ectropion will return worse than it was. Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, and fomentation with water in which marshmallow root and flaxseed have been steeped, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear it on the wick and treat it with it.
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally. This procedure that we have mentioned is only a partial correction of the ectropion, not that the appearance of the area will return to exactly how it was.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This ectropion, which occurs below, is what is truly called ectropion.  It may be natural or accidental.  The accidental type occurs from a wound, a laceration, cauterization, or the like.
The method of operating is to take a needle with a double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, until the thread is at both edges of the flesh. Then pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then [stop]. Otherwise, take a probe, place it on the location of the incision, and turn the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions starting from the corners of the cut that you made, until they meet, forming an angle. حتّى اذا اجتمعت يصير شكلها شبيها بهذا الشكل:.
Which is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove the flesh, making the acute angle lower than the eyelid. Then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread. Then treat it with the softening medications and bandages we mentioned until it heals.
If the ectropion resulted from an incision, a suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision, again below the eyelashes as described before, then separate the two lips [of the wound] with bandages as we mentioned.
In summary, the treatment of ectropion, whether upper or lower, should be carried out according to the form the ectropion takes, as it can vary greatly in appearance.  The experienced practitioner will devise a strategy by whatever means possible.
Until the form is restored to its natural state, or close to it.  The condition itself, in most cases, will guide you to the appropriate action and instrument.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or to the Cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but somewhat blunt, so that the patient does not become agitated during the procedure and cause the scalpel to slip and injure the eye with its sharpness.  And your cutting should be as if you are peeling that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the entire adhesion heals. Then pour salt water into the eye to wash it, or drop in dissolved copper sulfate eye drops. Then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick.
And place cotton wool moistened with egg white over the eye. After the third day, use soothing eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Cutting the Pterygium and the Excrescence of the Eyes.
The pterygium is of two types: either it is nerve-like, resembling a thin, hard membrane, or it is not nerve-like, resembling a solid white moisture which, if touched with iron or if you try to take it with a hook, breaks apart.
And the hook will not hold in it. Both types begin from the larger canthus until they gradually creep until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye. The method of operating in cutting them is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you pick up the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and pull it upwards. Then you take a needle and thread it with a hair from a horse's or cow's tail and a strong thread, and bend the tip of the needle slightly and insert it in the middle of the pterygium.
And pierce it with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and pull it upwards and peel the side of the pterygium that is next to the pupil with the hair, as if you were splitting it with the hair to its end. Then you cut the rest at the base of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its cutting.  And the pterygium may be pulled with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, then peel with the smooth scalpel the edge, which this is its image:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a hernia in it, so the pupil is damaged. Then, after cutting, put in the eye some powdered salt or vitriol collyrium and leave it until the next day. Then treat it appropriately until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification.  If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image:. واجرد الظفرة به من فوق جردا بلطف فإن رأيت أنّها تتخلخل وتتفتّت وأثر فيها الجرد فقطّر من ساعتك فى العين من الشياف الزنجارىّ او الشياف الأحمر او ملحا مسحوقا وشدّ العين الى يوم آخر.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling occurs in the eye.  Then leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then repeat the scraping procedure until it heals. As for the fleshy growth of the conjunctiva...
If the growth severely harms the eye, then grasp that growth with a hook and cut off some of it. Do not cut deeply, lest tearing occur. Then instill red or vitriol collyrium into the eyes until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of pterygium and the removal of excess flesh that grows in the eye.
A red, overlapping fleshy growth may develop in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or nearly covers it, or spreads over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you grasp all of that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.
Or you grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then you cut the flesh bit by bit until you completely excise it all, taking care with the eye so that you don't harm it during the procedure, and your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for excising pannus or with small scissors. كالتى تلقط بها السبل على ما تأتى صورتها فىالباب الذىيلى هذا الباب.
When your excision is completed and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye to prevent hot swelling.
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with what calms the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals. And likewise, do this with excess flesh of this type that occurs in the eye.
Except that you should avoid treating any eye weakened by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments, and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ is able to withstand the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Extracting Trachoma from the Eye.
Trachoma are red vessels that grow over the eye, preventing it from seeing and weakening it over time. So you should first look, and if the eye that has the trachoma is strong and has no other disease besides the trachoma.
then extract it, which is to have the patient place his head in your lap, then catch those vessels with one or two hooks, depending on your skill, and the hooks should be gently curved in this manner:.
or there may be two double hooks in one body, like this:.
Then gently grasp those vessels with fine scissors and wipe the blood from time to time until you see the eye and those vessels are gone from it and the blood is drained. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done at midday facing the sun.
And be very steady in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels, then when you are finished, instill into the eye the green or red collyrium so that it may consume with its sharpness what remains of the trachoma. If you cannot extract it all at that time, then dress the eye with something that soothes eye pain.
And leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and you are safe from the hot swelling, then repeat the procedure in this same manner until it heals. This is a picture of the smooth scissors.
And leave it [and the patient's head should be in the student's lap and another should wipe away the tears and fix the gaze on the front and back of the eye, and you] The basis of the operation is that you open the eye with fixed or triangular retractors held by a student.
sharp, and the patient's head should be in the student's lap and another should wipe the tears and fix the gaze on the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice to begin extracting from above the eye or from below it. It is best to insert two hooks in the upper side, one at the end of the fornix and the other at the beginning of it.
And hold them between your middle and index fingers, then attach hooks from below opposite them, then hold them between your little and ring fingers and lift your hand gently until you see the whole trachoma has risen.  Cut it from the smaller root, if you wish, with scissors, and if you wish, with a fine scalpel.
And insert the probe on a needle and probe the entire trachoma until it rises onto the probe, and do not cut while wiping because the tears and blood will make it difficult (liquefy) for you.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the fornix from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except on the cornea. If you can lift it from the cornea by peeling with the probe, that is better, and it may be possible in some people.
And if you cut it, it will irritate its place for days. Soothe its pain and protect it from hot swelling, then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Returning the Nasal Septum.
Physicians call the septum a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication, as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.
Until the bone is exposed. And when the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:
It is called the rough-headed one; it is made from Indian steel, and its head is round like a button, finely engraved like a file or scraper.  Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while you tighten your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then dress the area with desiccating, astringent medications. If the area heals over and flesh grows in it and the discharge stops, and this remains for forty days, and it does not recur, and there is no swelling, and no incident occurs,
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nostril in this way: you must expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe shaped like this:
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, tapering towards the tip as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nostril, and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it.
He will notice air coming out of it if he holds his hand over his nose. At that point, dress the area with astringent, desiccating medications as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was draining outwards will return to the nose, and this will be less distressing for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On Reducing Eye Protrusion.
If the eye protrudes in its entirety without causing any damage or impairment to vision, you should first reassure the patient.  Then bleed him from the cephalic vein, then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without scarification, and apply gentle suction.
Then, apply a poultice to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.  Then bandage the eye tightly over the poultice with many compresses.  The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each cloth into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye requires, then tie them tightly with a strong cloth. Reapply the cupping glass with suction, without scarification. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened again.  Then, after a day and a night, remove the bandage as we have said. If you see that the eye has returned to its place, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the application of the poultice, the compresses, the bandaging, and the cupping glass until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On incising the uvea.
If a hernia occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person, and you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.
That is, you insert a needle into the base of the growth from below to above. Then you insert another needle threaded with a double thread from the side of the canthus, and pass it through.  Leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the doubled thread at the loop and tie some of the growth around the needle and tighten it gently. Then remove the needle and apply wool moistened with egg white to the eye, and leave it until the threads fall off with the growth.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. You can also tie the growth from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye swells up gently, then lance it with a thin scalpel reaching to the depths of the eye, so the aqueous humor flows and the eye shrinks and withers on the spot, then bandage it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the Treatment of Pterygium.
This condition, which is called pterygium, is a growth that gathers in the eye, resembling but not actually, flowing water.  The way to operate is to sit the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your two hands.
And move it until you see the growth descend in the eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light breaks through and the patient sees things as he used to. If it does not descend, we know that it is fluid. If the descent of the growth cannot be achieved by what we have described…
Otherwise, sit the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.
Once it comes out, instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other medications until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three
We have mentioned the types of fluids in the classification and which ones are suitable for cupping with detailed and explanatory words. Take them from there correctly. Then you should sit the patient before you, cross-legged, facing the light, near the sun.
And you bandage his healthy eye and tighten it well, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye containing the fluid is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the lancet near the iris, about the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, towards the smaller canthus, then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the lancet that it has reached an empty space.
And the depth of the lancet's penetration should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the black, which is the iris of the eye, because you will see the lancet in the eye of the observer due to the clarity of the cornea. Then turn the lancet upwards to the place where the fluid is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see whatever he opens his eyes to immediately, while the lancet is still in his eye. Then wait a little. If the fluid rises, lower it again without removing the lancet.
When it has settled and does not rise, remove the lancet gently while slowly rotating it with your hand. Then dissolve some pure Indian salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a compress or moistened wool over the entire outside of the eye.
With rose oil and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye as well. But we and the people of our time apply crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the lancet does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. فينبغى أن تأخذ المبضع الذى يسمّى البريد الذى هذه صورته:.
Pierce the conjunctiva only with it, and do not penetrate deeply.  The purpose is just to prepare a small place for the lancet. Then insert the lancet as we have described. When your work is complete, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on his back in a darkened room.
He should refrain from all movement and coughing. His food should be what softens his nature. He should not move his head right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then you loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision.
Show him some things, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during the treatment or immediately after the incision. Rather, you should avoid this beforehand, because water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, you should uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what will reduce the swelling. When it subsides, you can then release his sight and put a veil over his face, training his vision under it for a few days while he is in the darkened room. Then...
He may gradually leave the house and manage his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the incision many times before proceeding with the operation. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned making a hollow lancet in Iraq that sucks out the water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It may be a recent innovation. This is a picture of the types of lancets, so those who are unfamiliar with them may understand them:.
They are made specifically of brass, and their tips are of this thinness exactly, triangular and sharp.
Chapter Twenty-Four
On the Treatment of Nasal Polyps.
Various excess growths may develop in the nose. Among these are some that resemble a multi-legged scorpion. Some are hard, cancerous growths, the color of dark blood. And some are soft growths, not the color of dark blood.
If any of these growths are soft, and are neither malignant nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit facing the sun. Open his nostril and insert the hook into the growth, then draw it outwards. Then cut whatever you can reach of it with a delicate, sharp scalpel, cutting from one direction.
Until you are certain that all of the growth is gone. If any of it remains that you are unable to cut, then gently scrape it with one of the delicate instruments, so that nothing of it remains. If the bleeding is overwhelming or a hot swelling develops...
...treat it as appropriate. Or if the growth is malignant, quickly cauterize it to stop the bleeding and remove all of the growth. Then, after the cutting, apply vinegar and water, or a medicinal drink, into the nose. If the nose opens and the fluid flows down the throat...
...know that it has healed. If the fluid does not pass through as it should, know that there is a growth inside, on the upper part of the ethmoid bone, which the instrument has not reached in cutting.  In this case, you should take a somewhat thick linen thread...
...and tie many knots in it, leaving the space of a finger or less between each knot. Have the patient contrive to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever he can, after twisting it like a wick. Have him draw it back up through his nose until it reaches the nasopharynx.
...and out through his mouth. Boys in school often do this sort of thing; it is easy for anyone who wants to. Then, bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out through the mouth and the one that remains in the nose.
Then saw the flesh with the knots that are in the thread. Do this until you know that the growths have been cut by the knots of the thread. Then, remove the thread and, after wiping away the blood, insert into the nose a wick that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
...until the ointment consumes all the remaining growths.  Then, lastly, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals. If it requires a drying treatment, apply it.
This is an illustration of the syringe with which oils and medicines are instilled into the nose:
Make (it) of silver or copper, resembling a small lamp, its opening and channel being open likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the syringe’s channel flattened.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to be held when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices or liquid things.
Chapter Twenty-Five
On warts growing at the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows at the tip of the nose, then enlarges and increases with time until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and completely excised. Then, either cauterization or a caustic medication that acts as cauterization should be applied to the area. If its excision is delayed until it grows large, examine it.  If it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and has little sensation.
Do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that when this tumor is cut, a great affliction returns upon its owner.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that complete excision is possible, فاستفرغ العليل واقطعه بلا حذر ولا توقّ وعالج الموضع بما يجفّف ويقبض حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. اذا تفرّق اتّصالها عن جرح او نحو ذلك اعلم أنّه متى حدث تفرّق اتّصال فى أحد هذه الغضاريف فقلّ ما ينجع فيها العمل إلّا فى بعض الناس.
So when something like this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  And if the separation has separated its edges and each side has become sound, then you should scrape each side to the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them powdered acacia and frankincense, and apply over the powders a plaster of palm ointment or other healing ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it.
And change the medication and leave it until the sutures dissolve on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as we explained to you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing nodules that occur on the lips.
Many people experience small, hard tumors inside their lips, some of which resemble chickpeas, and some smaller and larger. You should turn the lip outward and incise each nodule and grasp it with a hook.
And cut it from all sides, then after cutting cauterize the area with powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On excising excess flesh in the gums.
Often excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call epulis. It should be grasped with a hook or held with forceps and cut at its base. Allow the pus or blood to flow, then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
Or [apply] one of the astringent, desiccating powders. If that flesh returns after treatment, as it often does, cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On scraping teeth with an iron instrument.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, so that corruption reaches the gums and the teeth become ugly because of it.
You should seat the patient before you with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth on which you see the scales and the sand-like substance, until nothing of it remains. Likewise, you should do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and so forth, until you clean them.
If what is on them goes away with the first scraping, then [stop]. Otherwise, you repeat the scraping on another day, and a second and a third, until you achieve the desired goal. And know that the molar requires scrapers of various shapes and many forms, depending on what is suitable for your work.
Because the scraper with which the molar is scraped from the inside is not the scraper with which it is scraped from the outside, and the one with which it is scraped between the molars is of another form. And this is a number of forms of scrapers that you should have all prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the tooth for its pain by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance. Until, when there is no alternative to extracting it.
So when the patient resolves on its extraction, you should be certain, until you are sure about the aching tooth. فكثيرا ما يخدع العليل الوجع ويظنّ أنّه فى الضرس الصحيح فيقلعه ثمّ لا يذهب الوجع حتّى يقلع الضرس المريض، فقد رأينا ذلك من فعل الحجّامين مرارا.
So when you are certain of the specific aching tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a somewhat strong scalpel until you loosen the gum on all sides. Then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps, first little by little, until you loosen it.
Then grasp it firmly with the large forceps, and the patient's head should be between your knees, held firmly so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every side gently and softly, moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin probe, so that it does not crumble when you pull on it with the forceps. And you should incise completely around the gum on every side, yes indeed.
And take care not to break it, leaving some of it behind, which would cause the patient a worse affliction than his initial pain. And beware of imitating the ignorant cuppers in their boldness and haste in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often cause people great harm, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving all or some of its roots behind. وإمّا أن يقلع ببعض عظام الفكّ كما شاهدناه مرارا، ثمّ يتمضمض بعد قلعه بشراب او بخلّ وملح، فإن حدث نزف دم من الموضع فكثيرا ما يحدث ذلك فاسحق حينئذ شيئا من الزاج واحش به الموضع.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol is not effective.  A picture of the delicate forceps, which are used to loosen the tooth first: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. And this is a picture of the large forceps:
They are, as you see, thick-handled so that when you grip them they do not give way or bend, and they have short ends. Let them be made of Indian steel or well-tempered steel, with polished ends.  And at their ends are teeth that interlock, gripping firmly and tightly.
The ends may also be made like a file, thus making the grip strong as well.

On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jaw Bones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should place cotton with oil on the area for a day or two until the area softens, then insert the forceps or hooks. التى تشبه اطرافها فم الطائر الذى يسمّى البلرجة وهذه صورة الكلاليب:.
It should be made like a rasp on the inside, or like a scalpel.  If it does not yield to extraction with these hooks, then you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with the scalpel, then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, which is pictured here:.
Short-tipped, slightly thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root comes out with that, then good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are pictured here. The first has a triangular tip and is somewhat thick:
Another delicate triangular image:.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, which is also pictured here:.
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned earlier in the extraction of molars. We may also use this instrument that resembles a large hook, which is pictured here:.
Triangular-tipped, curved, somewhat thick so that it does not break, and not pointed.  Know that the instruments for molars are many, as are all other instruments, and they are almost countless. The skilled and experienced craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate to him.
Because there are some diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variation in their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then investigate it in its place with whatever is appropriate for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use a forceps, which is pictured here:.
It should have some thickness so that the bone can be grasped with it and not escape until the bone is extracted. And we treat the area with appropriate medications. If there is slight decay in the bone, scrape it from its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On sawing teeth that have grown over others.
When molars grow in other than their natural course, they make the appearance ugly, especially if this happens in women and slaves. So you should examine them. If the molar has grown behind another molar,
and sawing it or filing it down is not possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, which is pictured here:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian steel, very sharp at the tip. You should cut it over the course of several days, due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to loosen other molars. But if it is protruding in a way that allows filing, file it with a file made of Indian steel, which is pictured here.
It should be entirely made of Indian steel and its cutting edge should be very finely engraved, like the file used for making needles. File the tooth with it a little at a time, gently over several days, so you don't loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then, finally, smooth and polish it with a polisher.
If a part of a molar has broken off and it hurts the tongue when speaking, you should also file it down until the roughness of the break is gone and it becomes even and smooth and doesn't hurt the tongue or impede speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On Splinting Loose Teeth with Silver or Gold Wires.
If the front teeth become loose and shaky from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything that is eaten for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been successful.
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver wire, and gold is better because silver tarnishes and corrodes after a few days, while gold remains in its original state forever and is not affected by this. The wire should be of medium thinness and thickness, as much as fits between the teeth.
The method of splinting is to take the wire and insert its bend between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side with the weaving.
Then you return the weave to the side you started from and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all, and your tightening of the wire should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip, then you cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors and gather them and twist them with pliers and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not hurt the tongue, then you leave it tightened like this as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, you tighten it with another wire, so they enjoy it like this for a lifetime. And this is a picture of the teeth and the form of splinting in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:.
And a single tooth or two may be returned to its place after falling out, and it is splinted as we described, and it remains. But this is done by a skilled and delicate craftsman. And he may carve a bone from the bones of cattle and make it like a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone. ويشدّ كما قلنا فيبقى ويستمتع بذلك،.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the frenulum that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
This frenulum that occurs under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth with his head in your lap and lift his tongue, then cut that sinewy frenulum transversely so that the tongue is released from its constraint. If there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that is from the healing of a wound, then insert a hook into it and incise it transversely until the frenulum is severed and the knots are loosened.
And beware that the incision not be deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding occur. Then after the cutting he should rinse his mouth with rose water or with vinegar and cold water. Then place a wick of linen under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night.
This is so that it does not reattach. If bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the area with a lenticular cautery suitable for that. ثمّ عالجه بسائر العلاج حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On extracting the frog generated under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may grow until it fills the mouth. The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it dull-colored or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer.  But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and incise it with a delicate scalpel, and free it from every side.
If the blood overcomes you during the procedure, apply powdered vitriol to it until the bleeding stops, then return to the procedure until you extract it completely.  Then gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the Treatment of Swelling of the Tonsils.
And what grows in the throat from all other swellings.  Swellings similar to those that appear externally, called tonsils, may appear inside the throat, if you treat them with what I mentioned in the incision and they do not heal.
So observe, if the swelling is hard, dark in color, and with little sensation, do not treat it with iron.  And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not treat it with iron either, for fear of bleeding.  Rather, leave it until it ripens, then either incise it or let it burst on its own.
And if it is white, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut. The procedure for it is that you observe, before operating, if its acute swelling has completely subsided or decreased somewhat.
Then, sit the patient near the sun with his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have an assistant in front of you press his tongue down with an instrument like this:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you have pressed down the tongue and the swelling is apparent and visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument shaped like this, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, with each blade facing the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel shaped like this:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat him until he recovers.  Other swellings may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, so cut them as I mentioned regarding cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a swelling that had grown inside her throat, extending somewhat towards the uvula, almost completely blocking the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
She was near death, if she had remained a day or two longer. The swelling had put forth two branches that extended to her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them, and then I pulled it, extracting a good-sized piece.
Then I cut it where it reached her nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth and depressed her tongue, and inserted the hook into the swelling itself, and cut some of it.  Only a little blood flowed from it.
The woman's throat was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then took some food. We continued to cut from that swelling repeatedly for a long time, and the swelling would regrow in place of what was cut, until I and she became weary of it.
So I resorted to cauterizing the swelling inside her throat with a cautery iron, and it stopped growing. Then I left the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the Excision of a Uvular Swelling.
Which is called a grape. If a discharge descends to the uvula and it swells and is white and elongated, then it is called a column. And if it is thick at the bottom and round, then it is called a grape. This is if it has been treated with what we mentioned in the section on cauterization, but the treatment has not been successful.
And I saw the hot swelling had subsided from it and it was thin, so it should be cut. But anything from it that is collected and round, and does not have length, and is blood-colored or saffron-colored or black or has no feeling, should be avoided cutting.
There is danger in it for the patient.  So, if you see it with the characteristics I mentioned, of its whiteness and length, you should sit the patient beside the sun and depress his tongue with the instrument previously described. Then insert the hook into the grape.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for cutting the tonsils. And you should not cut from it except what is in excess of the natural state, no more. Because if you cut more from it, you will damage the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use what we described for cutting tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then you should use a trick to cauterize it without fear or caution.  The method of cauterizing it is with a sharp medication, which is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then depress his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then take some of the sharp water that I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization and mix it with quicklime, making it neither thick nor thin.  Fill the hollow of this instrument with it, and this is its picture:
Its end, which you put the medication in, has a hollow like the hollow of an ointment spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, with the patient lying on his side so that saliva flows from his mouth, from inside his throat, lest anything from it descend into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand on the medication, while pressing it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, you may take cotton and wrap it on the tip of a probe, and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula. Then leave it, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in ghee and dry the medication around it with it. Then gargle with cold water and treat it externally with poultices and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than excision and further from danger.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and excision; it is treated with fumigation in this way: Take lavender, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, artemisia, and similar herbs. Gather them all, or some of them, in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil it, with the pot sealed with lute, and in the middle of the lid there should be a hole on which the hollow instrument is fitted in this way: it is made of silver or copper.
And insert the end that has the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor ascends to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well fumigated. Then repeat it several times until it withers. Beware of performing this treatment at the first appearance of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling, and it should only be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you don't have this instrument, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth doesn't burn.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-Eight
On extracting thorns and other things stuck in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else gets stuck in the throat, so you should remove what is visible and can be seen after pressing down the tongue with the instrument in sunlight.
What you cannot see and is hidden in the throat, you should have the patient vomit before their food is digested in their stomach. Perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit, or the patient can swallow a piece of turnip or the root of chicory.
Or they can swallow a bite of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and then they swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a hook at its end.  The patient inserts it gently into their throat with their head raised upward, taking care not to touch their larynx so as not to cause coughing and dislodge the bone or thorn further. Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the embedded object. They push downward or pull upward with the instrument, as they are best able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On the Extraction of Leeches Stuck in the Throat
If you have treated the leech as we have mentioned in the section on treatment with medications, and it is ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after depressing their tongue with the instrument that was described to you.
If you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with carefully crafted forceps. If you cannot manage it this way, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a fire-heated iron rod into the lumen of the tube.
Do this several times and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then he should take a vessel filled with cold water and open his mouth into it and gargle with it and not swallow a drop.  He should move the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will immediately fall off when it senses the water. If it does not come out using what we have described, then fumigate the throat with urine and asafoetida with the instrument that we described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times and it will fall off.
The method for fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing embers heated by fire, and the pot should be covered with a lid with a hole in its center. Insert the tip of the instrument into that hole, then drop in the fumigant.  The patient places their mouth at the tip of the tube and closes their mouth so that the fumes do not escape, until it is certain that the fumes have reached the throat.
The leech will immediately fall off. If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salty foods and garlic, and not drink water. It must come out with this treatment. This is an image of the instrument with which you extract the leech from the throat if you see it.
It resembles hooks as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat and its ends resemble the beak of a bird.  It has the roughness of a file, so when it grasps something it does not let go.
Another instrument presses down on the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, large enough to fit in the mouth over the tongue. It is introduced into the mouth standing on its side, keeping the mouth open without the patient's volition. They are absolutely unable to remove it until you take it away.
Description of the instrument which opens the mouth, following these exact measurements.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing and incising tumors.
Tumors have many diverse types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book.  They differ in their cauterization and incision in two ways.  One is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second type stems from the locations they arise in the body, because a tumor occurring on the head is different from a tumor occurring on the buttock, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is different from a tumor occurring in a joint; the treatment for each of them differs.
Some tumors should not be cauterized until the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be cauterized while they are fresh and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and remains there for a long time until it putrefies what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing a chronic illness of that limb, or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
For if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that principal organ, or it may be near the anus, so you cauterize it fresh. The reason it is necessary to cauterize the immature tumor that is near the anus is so that the abscess does not putrefy and penetrate into the anus, becoming a fistula.
And it becomes incurable. You should know the time to cauterize tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever goes away, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all the other signs.
The cautery should be applied at the lowest point of the tumor, if possible, so that it is easier for the discharge to flow downwards, or at the thinnest and most protruding point of the tumor.  The cautery should be applied lengthwise along the body if the tumors are on the hands or feet.
And the locations of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, in all flat areas that have no curvature. As for those that bend, the cautery should be applied according to the location. But if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said. For if you cauterize it before that, the pus will flow from it for a long time, and it will be very harmful and messy, and perhaps its lips and depths will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body when necessary or depending on the need of the limb.
A single cautery should be used for small tumors, and a wide cautery or many incisions for large tumors, depending on the size of the tumor. Some tumors may need to have the skin scraped and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it reaches a point where it has died, such as what happens in many boils and abscesses. Some are incised with a triangular incision, and some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like inguinal tumors.
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions. If it does not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, it should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large and has accumulated for a long time, and you cauterize it, do not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some of the pus again. Do this repeatedly, gradually, until you remove it all.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, as the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, so the patient may die without you realizing it. So beware of this matter with great caution.
After you cauterize these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use linen or worn-out cotton wicks. If the tumor is large and the cautery incisions are numerous...
you should insert a wick into each incision so that they reach each other. If part of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, you should pack it with worn-out cotton or linen lint without moisture and bandage it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding continues, you should use the procedures, treatments, and powders that we have described in many places in this book and in the section. If it is winter and the site of the tumor has many nerves, you should moisten the bandages with syrup and hot oil.
and place them on the site. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked in water and oil or syrup and oil, all cold, until the third day, as we have said. Then you should unbind the tumor and wipe it.
Use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
On incising tumors that occur on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, and they are of the types of sals. Membranes surround them, which are their envelopes, like the crop of a chicken. And their types are many, some of them are fatty, and some of them contain moisture resembling mud.
And some of them contain moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on. And some of them are hardened and solid. All of them have no danger in incising and removing them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the probe, until you know what they contain. If what they contain is moisture, then incise them lengthwise with a simple incision like this image:.
And begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture is emptied, peel the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all out, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if anything of it remains.
Then dip cotton in the Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will eat away what remains of the sac. Then repeat the application of the cotton with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the swelling contains a fatty substance, incise it in this way:.
A cruciform incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from every side, and strive to remove the membrane that contains it.  If an artery obstructs you, do what I described to you later. And do the same with the swelling if it is hardened, as regards the incision.
And the treatment is the same as I mentioned.  The incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings that are on the head in some people may have no moisture at all, for I have incised a swelling on.
the head of an old woman and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone. No one could break it, and if someone threw it, it would cause injury.  And what is other than this of the various swellings occurring on the head, such as the swellings that appear on the heads of children.
And at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision and make their lower part lower so that the flow of matter to the bottom is facilitated, then treat them with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Scrofulous Swellings that Appear on the Neck. These swellings frequently occur on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins. They may occur on the rest of the body. Those that appear on the neck may be single or multiple, and some of them arise from others.
Each scrofulous swelling has its own membrane, as is the case with lipomas and head swellings, as we have described.  The types of these scrofulous swellings are numerous: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
If you find one that feels healthy to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and is not attached to a neck nerve, vein, or artery, and it is not deep. فينبغى أن تشقّها شقّا بسيطا من فوق الى أسفل البدن على هذا الشكل من خطّ ~ج~ الى خطّ ~ب~:.
And dissect it from all sides and retract the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks, or with many hooks if needed, as we have said regarding head swellings, and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
So that your hand does not cut more than intended or the patient moves causing you to cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, put powdered vitriol or some of the styptics that stop bleeding in the wound.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will stop then. Then return to your work until you are finished, then check with your index finger if any other small swellings remain, and cut them out and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the swelling, then you should not cut that swelling from its base, but you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then pack the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire swelling, then you should bring the edges of the wound together and sew it immediately after you know that no remnants of the swelling remain. If you see that remnants of the swelling's base remain.
Then you should aim to cut to its base and root and use stitching and what we have mentioned.  As for swellings containing fluids, lance them gently and superficially where they appear ripe to you and make the lancet from the lower part as we said.
Then, after lancing, use a wick with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On incising the larynx for a swelling occurring inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this is the gist of their words. As for those with diphtheria, they should avoid incising the larynx, as they will not benefit from it.
Because the tonsils and lungs will be diseased.  As for those with a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the trachea, then incising the larynx is necessary to escape the harm that results from choking.
It is necessary, if we wish to do this, to incise the larynx below three or four rings of the trachea, with a small transverse incision between two rings, as much as the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage.  And this place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is without flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it. If the practitioner is timid, it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he avoids the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then he incises the membrane that we described. And the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it with what is pierced and by the cessation of the voice. Leave the wound open for a time.  When the time in which choking was feared has passed, bring together the edges of the skin wound.
And stitch it alone without the cartilage, then use the medications that promote flesh growth until it heals.  The author of this book said: The explanation of all of these words that we have related is only if they see that the patient's throat has been blocked by one of these swellings that they mentioned.
And when the patient is near death and his breathing is about to cease, they proceed to incise the larynx so that the patient can breathe somewhat at the site of the wound and be saved from death.  And they are instructed to leave the wound open until the crisis of the illness has passed, and its crisis is three days or so.
Then they are instructed to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. And what I myself witnessed was a servant girl who took a knife and threw it at her throat, cutting part of her trachea with it. I was called to treat her and found her gasping like a slaughtered animal. So I uncovered the wound.
And I found the blood that came out of the wound to be slight, so I knew that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming out of the wound.  So I quickly stitched the wound and treated it until it healed.  And nothing happened to the servant except for some hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.
And after a few days she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that there is no danger in incising the larynx.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision over the swelling that appears in the larynx from the outside and is called elephant of the larynx.
This swelling, which is called elephant of the larynx, is a large swelling, the color of the body, and it is common in women, and it is of two types.
Either it is natural or it is acquired. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it. As for the acquired, it is of two types, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other type is similar to the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it. فلا ينبغى أن تعرض لها بالحديد البتّة إلّا ما كان منها صغيرا إن سبرتها وفتشّتها بالمدّس فألفيتها تشبه السلعة الشحميّة ولم تكن متعلّقة بشىء من العروق فشقّها كما تشقّ على السلع.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Incising the Types of Tumors.
Tumors have many types, and I have mentioned all of their types in the classification, and it is necessary for us to describe here the difference between the tumor and the abscess, as it is problematic.  So I say that the abscess comes with heat and fever and terrible pains until the boiling of the excess subsides. ويكمل العفن فحينئذ تسكن الحمّى والحدّة، والسلعة لا تكون معها لا حرارة ولا حمّى ولا أوجاع ويحويها كيس صفاقىّ هو لها ظرف خاصّ ويكون على لون البدن ويكون ابتداؤها كالحمّصة وتصير كالبطّيحة وأكبر وأصغر.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification. So it is necessary, when you proceed to the treatment of the tumor, that you probe it and examine it first with the instrument that is called the probe, as its image will come in the chapter after this.
as large as the tumor, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it is, then incise it with a simple incision, as I have mentioned in the other tumors. But if moisture does not come out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
So make a cruciform incision on it in this way, as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and gently peel the skin from every side, and preserve the sac, if you are able to do so, to remove it whole with the tumor.
If the sac is ruptured during the operation and you cannot remove it whole, then this often happens, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, for if anything remains of it, little or much, the tumor will return, most commonly.
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, then cauterize the wound when you are finished with some of the sharp, corrosive powders and tighten the wound and put on top of it what soothes the hot swelling and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the tumor is large, then suture its lips and treat it with what causes it to heal.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vessel and bleeding occurs, then quickly cauterize the area with ground vitriol and leave it bandaged for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On the illustrations of the instruments.
Which are used in incisions and abdominal surgery, among them are illustrations of probes, which are of three types, including large, medium and small.
Illustration of a large probe:
Illustration of a medium probe:
Illustration of a small probe:
They are made of steel iron, with square, smooth ends to facilitate entry into tumors. These are illustrations of the probes, and they are called probes. They are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large probe:
Illustration of a medium probe:
Illustration of a small probe:
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and hidden areas for what is inside them, such as bones and other things. It is made round, polished, and smooth like probes, from Chinese copper or Spanish copper, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver, and the best of them are those made from Spanish copper.
Probes can also be made of black lead, and they are suitable for probing fistulas that have a curvature in their depth, so that they bend with their flexibility with that curvature.  They are also of three types, because some of them are long, some are medium, and some are short.
According to the depth of each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Illustration of a large lead probe:

These are illustrations of scalpels with which to incise and excise growths and tumors. They are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large scalpel:
Illustration of a medium scalpel:
Illustration of a small scalpel:
Their blades, with which one incises, are sharp, and the other ends are blunt. They are made thus so that they may be used to excise growths when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be reassured and find some relief from the burning sensation that he feels when the tumor is excised.
These are illustrations of probes. They are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large probe:
They are made of copper, similar to the antimony kohl stick, and at one end is a sort of broad, two-layered spoon. At its tip is a hidden scalpel blade, resembling a bird's tongue, which can be extended or retracted as desired, as you see.
Illustrations of scalpels that are concealed between the fingers when incising tumors, without the patient feeling them. They are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large scalpel:
Illustrations of the cupping glasses used to staunch bleeding. They are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. Illustration of the large cupping glass:
They are made of copper or Chinese porcelain, somewhat elongated and rounded, as you see, and they should be thin. It is necessary to have these types of cupping vessels, large and small, at hand to quickly staunch blood when necessary and when no medication is available.
However, they are not used to stop bleeding in every part of the body, but rather they are used on fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar fleshy, moist organs.
Other small instruments resembling pistachio shells are also made in this manner:
With these, bleeding is stopped if it flows from the site of venesection or from a cut vein or artery.  They are also made rounded in this way:

On the Treatment of Man-Boobs.
Which resemble women's breasts.  The breasts of some people may swell at puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C: ثمّ اسلخ الشحم كلّه ثمّ املأ الجرح من الدواء الملحم ثمّ اجمع شفتى الجرح بالخياطة وعالجه حتّى يبرأ، فإن مال الثدى الى أسفل واسترخى لعظمه كما يعرض للنساء.
It is necessary to make two incisions on its upper sides resembling crescent shapes, each one joining the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one in this way: من خطّ ~ب~ الى خطّ ~ج~ ثمّ تسلخ الجلد الذى فيما بين الشقين وتنزع الشحم وتستعمل ما ذكرنا من الخياطة والذرورات وما يحتاج اليه من العلاج حتّى يبرأ.
If you cannot excise all that you need to excise because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in the corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On treating tumors that occur under the armpit.
These tumors that occur under the armpit are of the scrofulous kind, hard, contained in a sac, and some of them contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C. When you have evacuated all the fluid from the tumor, pack it with worn cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of scrofulous nodes, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on scrofula.  If the wound continues to suppurate, use cautery as we mentioned previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine
On the incision of the tumor that occurs because of an artery or vein, and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often arises from that. Likewise, a swelling and tumor can also arise in a vein.
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and distension are from an artery or a vein are these: if the swelling is from an artery, it will be oblong, concentrated in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you will feel a sort of creaking.
If it is from a vein, the swelling will be round, on the surface of the body.  Incising these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body.  And they are extremely large, so you should avoid treating them with iron.
And likewise avoid those that are in the extremities or in the head. As for the kind that results from the bulging of the mouth of an artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin over it, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I showed you in the suturing of the two arteries in the temples, then puncture with a scalpel the area between the two ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
And the swelling will subside, then employ the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from an incision of a vein, you should grasp with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as possible, then insert a needle below the place where you grasped with your hand and pass it through, with a double thread in it, until you bring it out the other side. ثمّ تربط به الورم ربطا جيّدا على حسب ما ذكرت لك فى ربط العنبة من الجهتين بطرفى الخيط، فإن خشيت أن تنسلّ الخيوط فأدخل إبرة أخرى بخيط آخر تحت الورم كلّه عند تقاطع الإبرة الأولى.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the swelling in its middle so that when what is in it comes out, you cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied off, then place on it a compress that you have soaked in wine and oil. ثمّ تستعمل العلاج الذى يكون بالفتل والمراهم حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Fifty.
On the swelling that appears from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if it receives a blow or results from excessive fatigue or the like and this is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a protruding swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body, and in most cases without pain, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling is not deep in the body.
Rather it is under the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it does not go forward or backward. So whatever of it is in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron, for it may cause chronicity, and whatever of it is in the head or in the forehead...
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. And if it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it. Close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Often, many people have warts on their abdomens and on other parts of their bodies. These warts are called "fungating" because they resemble mushrooms: their stalks are thin and their heads thick, and their lips are transformed. Some of them are small, and some become very large.
I have seen a man with two warts on his abdomen that were very similar to mushrooms, no difference, white with thin stalks and transformed, cracked lips, from which moisture constantly seeped. I excised them, and the weight of one was about eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.
The procedure for excising them is as follows: observe; if the patient has a moist humor, and if the wart is white, moist, and thin-stalked, then excise it with a wide scalpel. Have cauteries ready in the fire, because often much blood gushes out when they are excised.
Therefore, be prepared, and if the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened of being cut with iron, then take a strong lead thread and tightly tie it around the wart that has these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead thread further, and continue tightening the lead thread.
Do this every time it affects the wart until it is severed and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart has a thick stalk, there is some danger and risk in excising it, especially those on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to excise half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to excise a wart that is dark in color, minimally sensitive, and has an unpleasant appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the Treatment of Umbilical Protrusions.
Umbilical protrusions occur from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum that covers the abdomen, from which omentum or intestine protrudes, as occurs in all hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as has been explained; or from wind that collects in it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, the color of the swelling will be similar to the color of the body, and it will be soft without pain, and its position will appear varied. وإن كان من قبل خروج المعاء فيكون وضعه مع ما وصفنا أشدّ اختلافا فإذا كبسته بأصابعك يغيب ثمّ يرجع وربّما كان معه قرقرة ويعظم كثيرا عند دخول الحمّام والتعب الشديد، فإن كان من قبل الرطوبة فإنّه يكون ليّنا.
It does not disappear if you press it with your hand, and it does not increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then, in addition to these signs, the swelling appears blackish. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the swelling will be hard and solid and will remain a uniform size.
If it is due to wind, its touch will be soft. The procedure in this case is to observe. If the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for in that there is danger and risk, as I informed you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings that occur from an artery and a vein.
If the protrusion of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or omentum, then you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright, stretched out. Then mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. ثمّ تأمره أن يستلقى بين يديك على ظهره ثمّ تحزّ بمبضع عريض حول السرّة على الموضع الذى علّمت بالمداد ثمّ تمدّ وسط الورم الى فوق بصنّارة كبيرة ثمّ تربط موضع الحزّ بخيط قوىّ اوبوتر حرير ربطا وثيقا.
The knot of the tie should be a slip knot. Then open the middle of the tightened swelling above the tie and insert your index finger into it and search for the intestine. If you find that the tie has caught it, loosen the slip knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find omentum, pull it out with a hook.
And cut off the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, cauterize it gently and return to your work. Take two needles and thread two strong strings through them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the swelling, hardened and passed through. Then tighten the swelling in four places onto the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it off when it thins and rots. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.  If the protrusion of the umbilicus is from flesh growing in it...
or from moisture, then it is necessary to scrape out the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it. Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
The ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is incipient and small. But when it is advanced and large, it should not be touched.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. The procedure for it, if it is accessible as we said, is to first give the patient several doses of black bile, then bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.
Then place the patient in a position suitable for the operation, then insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer, then excise it from all sides with the skin completely so that nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and extract all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
On the Treatment of Acne.
We have already explained in the classification the types of ascites, how the water gathers, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not approached with iron at all.
For that is deadly. If you have treated this ascitic type of dropsy with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then observe: if the patient is extremely weak or has another disease besides dropsy, such as having...
a cough or diarrhea, and so on, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than dropsy, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the way to proceed is to have the patient stand upright before you. وخادم خلفه يعصر بطنه بيديه ويدفع الماء الى أسفل الى ناحية العانة ثمّ تأخذ مبضعا شوكيّا على هذه الصورة:.
Sharp on both sides, long, with a pointed tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that when operating you do not penetrate the intestine and harm it. Then observe: if the dropsy originated near the intestines.
it is best to make the incision three fingers below the navel, directly above the pubic bone. If the dropsy originated from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel. If it originated from a spleen disease, let the incision be three fingers to the right side.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that the fluids do not flow to that weakened area. Then puncture the entire skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are skinning it, and the amount that you skin should be about the size of a fingernail, or thereabouts.  Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the water is. Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, which looks like this:.
It is like a small tube, a thin reed made of silver or copper or polished smooth lead.  It has a small hole in its bottom and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Its tip can also be sharpened, like the point of a pen, like this:
At its top end is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument.  So drain a moderate amount of water at a time, because if you drain more than is necessary at once, the patient may die due to the collapse of his vital spirit.
Or he may experience fainting close to death.  Instead, drain an amount appropriate to his strength and as indicated by the patient's condition, from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and stop the flow of water, as it will stop immediately.
This is due to the skin that closes the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that way. Then repeat the procedure another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.
And also drain a small amount of the water. Do this for several days while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains. If you are concerned about the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And [promote] profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and restrict him from drinking, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.  Cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after draining the water as I described previously.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the treatment of children born with imperforate urethras, or with narrow openings, or openings in the wrong place.
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an imperforate urethra.  It is necessary to proceed immediately with its perforation as soon as he is born.
With a very fine scalpel, like this:
Then place in the hole a thin lead probe and tie it in place and keep it there for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, remove it and after he urinates replace it. And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows through the opening will prevent it from closing.
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with the lead probe as we have described for many days until it widens. And those whose opening is in the wrong place, that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward.
So he must lift the penis with his hand in order to urinate. And he is not born this way because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.  The way to operate in this case is to have the patient lie on his back.
Then you stretch his penis with your left hand, stretching it firmly, and you cut the tip of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you are carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and so that the opening is located in the middle as it should be.
And be cautious during the procedure of bleeding, for it often happens, so counteract it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On pustules that occur on the foreskin and penis, and blackness, and corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This pustule often appears in the urethra, and it is a vile fleshy growth, and there is a malignant and non-malignant type of it, so the non-malignant one should be hung with a fine hook.
And cut it until you have cleaned it all, then apply cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment to it, then treat it afterward with palm ointment until it heals.  But if the pustule is malignant, vile in color, then cauterization should be used on it after cutting and scraping it.
If the pustule is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised boy, and some of the pustule is on the inside of the foreskin and some of it on the outside, then the pustule that is on the inside should be removed first, so that when it has healed, then treat it from the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure the foreskin will not be perforated.  Blackness and corruption can also occur on the labia and on the foreskin, and it is necessary to excise everything that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed.
Then apply honey to it afterward, with the sifted, pounded peels of pomegranate and frankincense, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it putrefies. If the glans is corroded and consumed in its entirety at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision. Adhesion can also occur from a wound or a tumor. It is necessary to dissect it with a blunt scalpel so that the adhesion is released and the glans is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish it completely, it is necessary to dissect some of the glans and some of the foreskin, because the foreskin is thin and may be quickly perforated due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat it with an astringent syrup until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the Hygiene of Boys and Treatment of Accidental Injuries that Occur to Them.
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is done by our own will and is performed specifically on boys, we must describe the best practice for it.
And the easiest way that leads to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their religions, but rather it is something we have adopted.
Through experience, I have found that most surgeons and cuppers perform circumcision using a scalpel and scissors, and they use a fibula, thread ligature, and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all of these methods.
I have not found anything better than circumcision using scissors and ligature with thread, because when circumcising with a scalpel, the skin often adheres to it because the foreskin has two layers, and sometimes the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Circumcision with a fibula risks cutting the tip of the urethra, as it may enter its opening. As for circumcision with the fingernail, the skin may slip and ruin your work, or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short...
They are often born like this, not needing circumcision, and I have seen this. As for circumcision with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors cut evenly since the upper blade is like the lower blade.
So when you squeeze your hand, coordinating the two blades, they cut evenly and at the same time, so the ligature becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra on all sides, so no error occurs at all. The method is, first, to distract the boy.
Especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then make him happy and delight him in every way you can and that his mind accepts. Then have him stand between your hands, upright.
He should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; the boy's eye should not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow into the skin, and lift it up until the tip of the urethra emerges.
Then clean it of any dirt that has accumulated in it. Then tie the marked area with a double thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it. Then grasp firmly with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures. ثمّ ارفع الجلدة الى فوق بسرعة وأخرج رأس الإحليل ثمّ اترك الدم يجرى قليلا فهو أفضل وأقلّ لورم الإحليل ثمّ تنشفه بخرقة رطبة ثم ذرّ عليه من رماد القرع اليابس المحرق فهو أفضل ما جرّبته او دقيق الحوّارى فهو أيضا فاضل.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and expose the tip of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or knotgrass flour, which is also excellent. ثمّ تحمل على الذرور من فوق فى خرقة فصّ بيضة مطبوخة فى ماء الورد مضروبة بدهن الورد الطرىّ الطيّب وتتركه عليه الى يوم آخر ثمّ تعالجه بسائر العلاج الى أن يبرأ.
This is a picture of the scissors that are suitable for circumcision:
They should be sharp, cutting, without any bend, with a secure screw, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles. As for the mistakes that occur in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin, all or part of it, folds over during the cutting, so it is necessary to immediately extend it with your fingernail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If three days have passed and what is under the tip of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and then gently peel it off.
And cut it as much as is feasible for you, but be careful of the tip of the urethra. If a part of the tip of the urethra is cut, it will not cause harm. Treat it with wound-healing powders that we have described in the chapter on powders.
And if more than necessary is cut from the skin and it retracts upwards, it will not cause much harm either. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage from a stone, clotted blood, pus, or growth of tissue, and the like. If you have treated it with the various treatments we described in the section,
and the urine has not been released, and you believe that its retention is due to a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary to have the patient kneel on his knees, then someone should mount his back, stretch his belly towards his back, and have the patient hold himself as much as he can.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will be released. If it is not released by what we have described, and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use the instrument called a catheter to extract it, which is depicted here:.
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, and hollow, like a bird's feather quill in its thinness and length, about a span and a half long, with a delicate funnel at its head.  The way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie good knots with wool or cotton at its end.
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors any excess wool so that it enters the tube and plugs it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.
Anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it.
Once the urethra is bent, push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
It is made in this manner because the passage through which urine flows has curves. Then pull the thread with the wool gently, and the urine will follow the wool.  Then remove it and the urine will pour out.  Reinsert the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the forms of the instruments that are suitable for it are made of silver or of hollowed ivory, having a long thin tube like pus.  And if you wish to instill fluids and medications in it, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its form:
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, having a long, thin tube like a probe, all of it hollow except the tip, which is solid. It has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow place in which the piston is should be of a size that fills it completely, without excess, so that when you pull something of the fluids with it, they are drawn in, and when you push with it, they are propelled to a distance, like how the pump is made with which naphtha is thrown in sea battles.
If you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the piston upwards, then the fluid will be drawn into the cavity of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra as we described for catheters, then push the fluid with the piston.
Then that fluid will reach the bladder as intended until the patient feels it. And this is the image of another fine syringe with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper head resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the tie is placed. Then you take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid with which you want to inject the bladder, then you tie it tightly between the two partitions with doubled thread.
And warm that liquid a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then firmly squeeze your hand on the bladder containing the liquid so that the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
If you don't have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around its edge, then insert a strong thread into those holes as you rotate, then gather the circle like you gather a tablecloth after you put in it what you want of fluids, oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, squeezing your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On extracting the stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I mentioned the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the stone generated in the bladder and the signs of all of that, and I mentioned the stone in which the work is done by hand and incision.
And it is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which sticks in the urethra, and I will describe that with a clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he rubs his penis and fiddles with it, and it often hangs low then spreads out, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them, and recovery from it is easy for boys until they reach fourteen years, and it is difficult in old men, and as for youths, it is intermediate between that.
And the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that. So if we proceed to the treatment, it is necessary first to inject the ill person with an enema that expels all the filth that is in his intestines, for it may prevent the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Then the sick person is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then you sit him upright before you with his hands under his thighs so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then you examine him.
And you palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the open space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it. But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to anoint the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a mature youth, you insert it in his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you want to make the incision.
And you order an assistant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you order another assistant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand and with his other hand to stretch the skin that is under the testicles away from the location where the incision will be. Then you take the extracting scalpel which has this form:.
And you make an incision between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock, and the incision should be directly over the stone with your finger in the anus and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, just enough for the stone to come out.
No larger, for perhaps the finger that is in the anus might press the stone at the time of the incision so that it comes out without difficulty.  And know that there may be some stones that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult for that reason.
And some of them are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy. As for those that have angles and edges, you widen the incision a little. If it does not come out this way, then it is necessary to use a trick on it, either by grasping it with strong forceps, the tip of which is like a file.
so that it grips the stone and does not slip from it, or you insert a delicate instrument with a curved end under it.  If you are unable to get it with that, then widen the incision a little.  If some of the blood overwhelms you, stop it with vitriol.
If there is more than one, first push the larger one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise over it, then push the smaller one after that, and likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, then it is foolish to make a large incision over it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he dies or he perpetually dribbles urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with forceps until you get it out piece by piece.
When you have finished your work, stuff the wound with frankincense, aloe, and acacia, and bandage it, and place over it rags moistened with oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the burning swelling. Then the patient should lie on his back and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.  If excessive burning swelling occurs in the wound, and erosion, and the like, such as if blood congeals in the bladder and blocks the urine, and this is known by the discharge of blood with the urine,
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
And it is necessary at all times of treatment to tie the thighs and bring them together to secure the medicines that are placed on the area.  If the stone is small and has entered the urethra and become lodged in it and prevents the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it enters the perineum.
For I have often avoided the perineal incision with this treatment, and I have tested it, which is that you take a forked instrument of steel whose form is this:.
Triangular at the tip, sharp, and inserted into a handle.  Then you take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then insert the forked instrument gently into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself.
And rotate the fork with your hand around the stone little by little as you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, for the urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing it, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then extract it.
Then untie the thread and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above is so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On extracting the stone in women.
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and avoided for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and the second is that you do not find a woman who permits herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or has close male relatives, a third reason is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially manual work; and fourth, the place of incision for stones in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision.
And in that is danger.  If necessity calls for it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but she is rarely found. If you cannot find her, seek a kind, gentle male physician. Or have a midwife skilled in women's matters present, or a woman with some knowledge of this craft.
Have her attend and instruct her to perform all that you command her, beginning with the examination for the stone. That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin. She should insert a finger into her rectum and examine for the stone. If she finds it and can press it with her finger
then instruct her to make the incision.  If she is not a virgin but is married, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downward as far as she can until it reaches the base of the thigh.  Then make the incision opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh, on whichever side is easiest and where the stone is felt.
Her finger should not move from the stone, pressing down upon it. The incision should be small at first. Then insert the probe through this small incision. If the stone is felt, enlarge the incision as needed until you know the stone can be extracted. Know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched.  Know their types so that you may be guided by this in what you intend. If bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered vitriol on the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is extracted. And be sure to prepare for yourself the instruments mentioned for the removal of stones in men to help you in your work. If you are overcome by bleeding, and know by the pulse that it is from a severed artery, apply cautery to the area.
Bind it tightly with bandages, leave it, and do not return to it.  Leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound.  When the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area has become less inflamed, return to your work until you extract the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On incising the varicose vein.
The varicose vein is simply a collection of moisture in the white membrane which is under the skin of the testicles surrounding the testicle and is called the scrotum. It may also be in its own special membrane which nature prepares on one side of the testicle.
So that it is thought to be another testicle, and it is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane which we mentioned.  This is rare.  This vein arises from a weakness affecting the spermatic cords, so this substance flows to them, and it may also arise from a blow to the spermatic cords.
This moisture is of many colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or turbid black, or watery white, which is most common.  The signs by which it is known:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like the shape of a testicle, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in its own membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one imagines that it is another testicle. And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane, then it lies beneath the senses. As for if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image has been presented previously, and whatever comes out after the probe, judge by it what is inside.
When we proceed to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to be bled, if he can tolerate it and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly elevated and you place many cloths beneath him, then you sit on his left.
And you order an assistant to sit on his right, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and toward the side of the abdomen. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the pubis.
And make the incision in a straight line parallel to the line that divides the skin of the scrotum in half, until you reach the containing white membrane, then peel it back and take care not to cut it, and your peeling of it should be from the side that adheres more to the testicle. And continue the peeling as much as you can.
Then you open the water-filled membrane with a wide opening and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and pull the membrane upwards, but do not touch the containing skin of the testicle, and cut the membrane however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, because if you do not completely cut it, you cannot prevent the water from returning. If the testicle protrudes out of its skin during your work, when you have finished cutting the membrane, return it, then bring the edges of the skin of the scrotum together with stitches.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals. If you find the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, it is necessary to tie the vessels that are in the spermatic cord, fearing bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the collected water is in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. So incise the other side as you did the first, similarly. And if it is possible for you to perform the operation as one, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have dipped in oil or rose oil, and place outside other wool that you have dipped in wine and oil and spread it over the testicles and the abdomen and place folded cloths on top, which are the compresses. وتربطها من فوق بالرباط الذى هو ذو ستّة أطراف على هذه الصورة:.
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them together, and stuff them with carded wool in this manner, and make the straps that are tightened with it from cotton or damp wool and gather them by tightening them at the trouser belt, and one of the straps takes from the buttocks to the back.
And the second you take towards the pubis and the two ends on the thighs from below and the two remaining ends on the groins, and you gather all the tightening at the trouser belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated with cautery instead of incision with iron.
Which is that you take a fine scalpel-shaped cautery and incise the skin of the testicle with it while it is hot as we have described until the white membrane containing the water is exposed, then take another cautery of this form:
And it resembles the Greek eye, then you dab that membrane with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out, then you stretch the membrane with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you remove it all and take care that the testicle is not touched by the fire.
And know that this procedure is safer and further from bleeding and better than the procedure with incision. If you encounter during the incision or during the cautery a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then it is necessary that you treat whatever you encounter of that with the appropriate treatment as has been previously mentioned.
If the patient is cowardly and does not bear this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then let him use the dabbing as I will describe it, which is if it is deemed correct by you with the proofs we presented earlier.
If the hydrocele is watery, then you should sit the patient on a high chair, then dab the swelling at its bottom with a wide scalpel, and make the dabbing along the body and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out, then place cotton on the area and bandage it.
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the exit of the water is difficult while you are dabbing it, it is because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water.
Then it is necessary to insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of lovers is extracted, the image of which has been presented, or increase the opening of the wound a little.
And know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, dab it in the same manner and the patient should fend off its recurrence.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On the Incision of a Fleshy Vein and its Treatment.
Know that incising this vein is one of the errors leading to death in most cases, therefore, we recommend leaving it alone for safety.  However, I will describe the procedure on it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.  The color of the swelling is the same as the body's color and there is no fluid in it.
The swelling is hard, and sometimes the swelling is petrified, its color is dark, and it has no feeling.  It may be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  As for what comes from swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dissipation of the swelling.
When you press it with your fingers, it should not change at all. As for what results from swelling of the veins, nothing dissipates from it when pressing with the fingers.  This type can be incised, as well as other fleshy (swellings).
That is, you incise the skin of the testicle, then pull the testicle upwards and take it out of the white membrane, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after you free it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the proliferating tissue.
It is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it off.  And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the fleshy growth is in the place of adhesion, which is from behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle, as we have said. When you have finished your work, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the treatment of hydrocele with varicocele.
Varicocele is a tortuous, somewhat twisted swelling, similar to a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment of this disease is nearly the same as what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to sit the patient on a high chair, then push the scrotum downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And let another assistant hold it and stretch it tautly. Then, with a wide, sharp scalpel, make an oblique incision next to the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect them from every side, as I described to you in the chapter on dissecting the arteries in the temples. Then insert a needle with a double thread through them.
And tie them at the beginning of the places where the varicocele appears, and tie them also at the end.  Then cut them in the middle with an incision lengthwise along the body, and drain the turbid, corrupt humors that have collected in them.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds that you want to suppurate so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off, and there is no harm in that. If the varicocele affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment. من قبل قطع الأوعية فتذبل ولا ينتفع بها،.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the Treatment of Inguinal Hernia.
This hernia occurs from a tear that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen around the groins from the thin part of the abdomen, so the intestine falls from that rupture to one of the testicles.
This rupture occurs either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its distension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow or a jump or a shout or lifting something heavy and so on. And its sign, if it is from distension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long period of time.
And it does not happen suddenly, and the swelling is level towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. And its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it causes great pain from the beginning suddenly, and the swelling is different, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is by the intestine exiting and going outside of the peritoneum, and the omentum may also exit with the intestine, so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it may be with air.  And the stool may run into the intestine and be trapped there, so it results in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when squeezed, and treating these types of ailments with iron is dangerous, so you should avoid engaging in it. The method of operation is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into his cavity if it is possible to return.
Then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin adjacent to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the testicle lengthwise, then you insert hooks in the lips of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
And the incision should be as much as allows the testicle to come out, then you dissect the membranes that are under the skin of the testicle until, when the hard white peritoneum is exposed from all sides, then insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle and between the second peritoneum, and with it you release the adhesion that is behind the testicle, then fold with the right hand inside the skin of the testicle, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand and raise the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
And you order the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you release the adhesion that is behind it completely, and you search with your finger lest there be something from the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum, and if you find something of it, then push it into the abdomen below.
Then you take a needle containing a thick thread spun from ten threads and insert it at the end of the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle adjacent to the incision, then you cut the ends of the doubled thread so that there are four threads. ثمّ تركّب بعضها على بعض بشكل مصلّب وتربط بها الصفاق الذى قلنا إنّه تحت جلدة الخصى رباطا شديدا من ناحيتين ثمّ تلفّ أيضا أطراف الخيوط وتربطها ربطا شديدا حتّى لا يقدر شىء من الأوعية التى تغذوها على أن يصل اليها شىء.
So that a hot swelling does not arise from that, and it also becomes a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers, and after these two ligatures, you leave from the peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle the amount of a finger's breadth. وتقطع الباقى كلّه على استدارة وتنزع معه البيضة، ثمّ تشق أسفل جلدة الخصى شقّا يسيل منه الدم والمدّة كما وصفنا فيما تقدّم، ثمّ يستعمل الصوف المغموس فى الزيت ويوضع فى الجرح ويستعمل الرباط الذى وصفنا.
And the white peritoneum that we mentioned may be cauterized after cutting it, to prevent bleeding, as that often occurs, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; if its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with hot water and something that makes it sweat should be applied to it until it falls off.
Then the wound is treated with the rest of the treatment for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
On the varicose vein.  This varicose vein, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described for the vein that is with the scrotum, that is, that the vessels should be tied gently below, after the incision on them.
Then it is incised in the middle, and the swelling is treated with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On the hernia that is in the groin.
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the testicles. And if it does descend, it is a small amount and returns at all times.
But if it continues for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said. وذلك أنّه يمتدّ الصفاق ثمّ يسترخى ويرم الموضع وينتو، وعلاجه بالكىّ كما قدّمت وصفه.
It can also be treated with iron in this way: The patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely for a length of three fingers, then you pack the peritoneal layers that are under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum underneath it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then sew the two protruding parts on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and attach one to the other with the stitching.
Then remove the tip of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When the sutures have dissolved, clean it and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this area because it is closer to a cure.
Chapter Sixty-Eight
On the Relaxation of the Scrotum.
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside it relaxing, and its appearance becomes unsightly.  So, whoever wishes to treat it should have the patient lie on his back.
And he cuts all the skin that has relaxed to the thick skin, then brings the two edges together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On Castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, it would have been fitting for me not to mention it in this book of mine, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one is so that it may be within the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it and so that he knows the treatment for anyone afflicted by it, and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Like lambs, goats, cats, and other such animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. The one that is by crushing, the way to perform it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be discerned by touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle.
So that when the testicles protrude, you cut them after peeling them, and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of the Hermaphrodite.
Hermaphroditism occurs in men in two ways: one is that there appears below the perineum or in the scrotum's skin between the two testicles a form as if it were a woman's vulva, with hair in it. And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum's skin.
As for in women, it is of one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward, one of them as if it were a man's penis, and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types...
The two types in men and the one type in women, it is necessary to cut off those excess growths until their trace is obliterated, then treat them with the treatment of all other wounds until they heal. As for the second type in men, from which urine comes out, the one that is in the scrotum's skin, there is no treatment for it, nor any hope of recovery at all.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Excision of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh Protruding from Women's Genitalia.
The clitoris sometimes increases in size beyond the natural state, so that its appearance becomes unpleasant and ugly. And it may enlarge in some women until it spreads out like men's, and becomes suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it. Do not go deep in cutting, especially at the root of it, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the protruding flesh, it is flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outward like a tail. ولذلك يسمّيه بعض الأوائل المرض الذنبىّ فينبغى أن تقطعه كما تقطع البظر سواء وتعالجه حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Seventy-Two
On the Treatment of Imperforate Anus
Imperforate anus is when the woman's vulva is not perforated or the opening is small. This can either be congenital, something she is born with, or accidental. The accidental type occurs due to a preceding cause, and it results from excess, protruding flesh.
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depths of the uterus, or in its sides, or in its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation.  Knowledge of it is through examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near, (treat it). If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is of a thin membrane and it is near the labia, then immediately perforate it. That is, you should place something like supports on the labia, then place both of your thumbs.
With the woman on her back and her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia forcefully until the thin membrane ruptures and the obstruction opens. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. Have the woman engage in intercourse every day so that the area does not rejoin.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an ace of spades. If the obstruction is from protruding flesh, grasp it with hooks and cut it. You should have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; keep it in for several days.  Use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with other wound-healing treatments until it is cured.  Another fleshy growth may occur in the uterus; it should be cut in this same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be touched with an iron instrument.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Warts, and Red Pustules That Occur in Women's Genitals.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the openings of veins until much blood constantly flows from them. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and cannot be felt, cannot be treated with an iron instrument. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that can be treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then stretch the warts with forceps or a coarse cloth and cut them from their roots. Then, when the blood flows, sprinkle on them one of the styptic powders that stops bleeding without cauterization.
Such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a poultice on her back. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, apply cupping to the back and breasts without scarification. Then take cotton and soak it in the juice of purslane or the juice of plantain or the juice of blackberry branches with a decoction of gallnuts and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the tips of nettles, rough in appearance.  You should cut off what appears of it in the same way as I mentioned for warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On lancing the abscess that occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, abscesses, corroding ulcers, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor.  I have mentioned all of these diseases and their types and signs in the classification.
We should mention in this section the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus if it is among the tumors that collect over time how its lancing with iron is done. You should observe, if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And you see it red, if the sensation falls upon it, do not rush to lance it, and treat it with what helps it ripen until, when these symptoms subside, then you should sit the woman on a chair with two seats and have her lean back.
And she brings her legs together towards the lower abdomen and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are placed under her knees, and you tie them with a suitable bandage.
For this, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is opened, whose image will come later. It is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
It would harm the patient, so if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place supports on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary for the screw that runs in the instrument to be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the screw until the cervix opens. So when the abscess appears and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel when the entire period has been completed.
It is necessary to place in the wound a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, and the wick extends from the incision in the cervix, and on the outside, on the uterus and on the pubis, place clean wool dipped in water in which mallow has been boiled.
Then treat after two days with the ointment suitable for it until it heals.
The uterus and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it with what we mentioned in the chapter on incisions.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they come out in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth. Its signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and feeling relief from her labor pains.
And the exit of the fetus is quick. Know that this birth will be in the natural form, and its exit will be headfirst, with the placenta either with it or hanging from its umbilical cord. So if you see these signs, it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly.
For if it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and she is cleansed well of those excesses. Any birth other than this is unnatural and undesirable, because the fetus may come out feet first, or its hands may come out before its head and feet.
Or one hand or one foot may come out, or its head and hand may come out, or it may come out folded, and perhaps it is turned on its back, and similar undesirable forms.  So it is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all these things, and to beware of slips and errors.
And I will explain each of its forms and the remedy for it, so that you may be guided by it and understand it.  If the fetus comes out headfirst, the natural way, and that is difficult for the woman and labor is hard on her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then sit her on a chair and order women to hold her steady.
And apply a poultice of cooked fenugreek and moist oils to her womb. Then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it, or cuts it with her fingernail, so that the moisture in it flows out. And she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek mucilage and rose oil. Then, after the injection, order her to strain and make her sneeze with pellitory, and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately. If the hands of the fetus come out first, it is necessary to push them back gently, little by little.
If they cannot be pushed back in, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground, and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaking. If the hands do not go in and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull the rest of the fetus.
Or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for it will come out.  The exit of the fetus on its feet: If the fetus comes out feet first, it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it. Then take one of its legs and pull it little by little.
When they have come out to the thighs, order her to strain and make her sneeze with pellitory, for it will come out. If it does not come out as we have described, then return the fetus little by little until you return it to its natural form, for it will then come out smoothly. If it is retained despite all we have described.
Take marshmallow root mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, rose oil, and dissolved gum, and beat it all together well in a mortar. Then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then sit her in lukewarm water up to the hips.
When you see that her lower part has softened, make a pessary of myrrh for her, which she can tolerate. When she has held the pessary for an hour, seat her on a birthing chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately. The exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this way, maneuver to insert its hands little by little. Then the woman should lie on her back and let her thighs hang down while lying on a bed and clasp her hands. Then squeeze her upper abdomen little by little. ثمّ أخرج ما تحت رجليها من الوسائد حتّى تكون منصوبة الأسفل فإن لم يخرج الجنين فخذ رجليها جميعا فحرّكهما حركة شديدة ثمّ اعصر فوق الشراسيف قليلا قليلا حتّى يصعد الجنين الى فوق ثمّ تدخل القابلة يدها وتسوّى الجنين قليلا قليلا.
And tell the woman to strain until the fetus comes out. The exit of the fetus transversely, with one of its hands hanging out. Maneuver to return its hand. If you cannot return it, have the woman stand up and make her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down on...
her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice I described from the saliva-inducing agents. If labor pains take her, seat her on a birthing chair. Then work on returning the hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural position. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus on its back, extending its arms, with its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little and adjust it gently. Once adjusted, apply to the vulva what we described of the ointment and saliva-inducing agents.
Then tell her to move little by little. When she has done that, sit her on the chair and tell her to lean towards the right side. Then tell her to push and make her sneeze with the kalamus, as it will come out.  The exit of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the opening of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail so that it releases the fluid. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord so that it does not suffocate and die. Then push the fetus back inside until you position it as it should be.
And tell the woman to push repeatedly, for it will come out easily. The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born and live, although that is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature; they do not live at all.
And a single placenta surrounds them, however many there are, and they are separated by a dividing membrane between them, connected to the umbilical cord of each one of them. And they may come out just as a single fetus comes out, with a natural, easy exit, and they may come out with a problematic exit, as we have described.
If one of them has difficulty during birth and becomes one of the unnatural forms we mentioned, treat it as we have described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience. And let her manage each form with whatever appropriate technique she can to achieve a safe outcome.
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses that are miscarried.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus. It has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing. All of this should be in the midwife's knowledge, for perhaps she will encounter something like this someday, so she can deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
On extracting the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment and it does not come out, and the matter compels you to work with the hand, then you should observe. If the woman is of sound strength and there are no symptoms that you fear will cause her harm, then the woman should lie down on a bed on her back.
And her head should be inclined downward and her legs elevated, and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body is not pulled when the fetus is extended.
Then the mouth of her womb is moistened with moist oils along with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and flax seeds.  Then the midwife anoints her hand with these oils and mucilages, then inserts it gently into the womb. Then she searches for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Observe, if the fetus is coming headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin or its collarbone, or in the places near the ribs, or under the shoulder blades.
And if it is coming feet first, then in the pubic bone and the middle ribs. And the hook should be held in the right hand and its curve placed between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand inserted gently, and the hook inserted into one of those places that we mentioned.
Until you reach an empty space, then insert opposite it another hook, or a third if needed, so that the pulling is even and does not tilt to one side.  Then pull evenly, and the pulling should not be straight only, but move it in every direction.
So that its exit is easy, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. And in between, the pulling should be relaxed. If one side of it is stuck, the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side to turn what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, move the hooks to other places.
They are a little higher up. Do this until the entire fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before anything else and it cannot be put back due to its compression, then it should be wrapped with a cloth, then pull it until, when it has come out completely, you cut it off.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and thus should be done with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences compression during birth, or if there is fluid accumulated in its head, then a sharp scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
And with it the head is incised so the fluid comes out, or extract it with the instrument that is called the extractor, whose image appears with the images of all the other instruments in the chapter after this one.
Likewise, do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed: the skull should be incised or crushed with the extractor, as we said, then extract the bones with the forceps. If the head emerges and gets compressed at the clavicle, make an incision so that the moisture in the chest pours out.
For the chest then contracts. If the chest does not contract and birth is not possible, then cut piece by piece as best you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or there is a hernia, it should be lanced so that the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is by its feet, then pulling it is easy and its alignment at the mouth of the womb is simple. If it gets compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand and cut the abdomen or chest so that what is in them drains out.
If you have extracted all the limbs and the head retracts and gets stuck, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert the hand into the cervix and search for the head and pull it with the fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has affected it, you should not be rough with it, but rather use moist, fatty pours and apply compresses, and sit in baths that relax and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, if it can be adjusted, use what we mentioned for the live fetus. If that is not possible, then cut it piece by piece and extract it. It is important not to leave any part of the placenta inside at all. When you are finished with your treatment, use what we have mentioned regarding the treatment of hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into astringent baths and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant and the fetus died in her womb, then she became pregnant again on top of it.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time a swelling appeared in her hypogastrium and swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, so I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I placed on it some of the ointments with strong drawing power.
A bone came out of the area, then after a few days, another bone came out. I was surprised by this, as the abdomen is a place without bones.  I estimated that they were from the bones of the dead fetus. I explored the wound and extracted many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived in that state for a while, discharging a little pus from the area. I have only mentioned this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
Containing illustrations of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Illustration of a dilator with which the mouth of the womb is opened.
This bookbinding press, which is used for flattening books, likewise has two screws at the ends of the two wooden boards, except that this screw should be finer than the press and should be made either of ebony or boxwood, and the width of each board should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their edge is about a finger's breadth, and their length a span and a half, and in the middle of the two boards are two posts of the same wood, securely fastened to them, the length of which is half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more, and these two posts...
...are what are inserted into the mouth of the womb to dilate it when you turn the two screws. Illustration of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, except that it has two posts at its end, as you see, the length of each post is about a span and their width is two fingers. So when you want to open the womb with it...
...have the woman sit on a bed with her legs dangling spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two posts closed together into the mouth of the womb while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the forceps in the same way, to the extent that you want to open the womb. حتّى تصنع القابلة ما تريد، صورة لولب آخر ذكره الأوائل:.
Illustration of the instrument with which the fetus is pushed.
Figure of the perforator with which the fetal head is perforated.
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end, as you see. It may also be made rectangular like forceps, in this way, as you see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Figure of another pusher.
Figure of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it. Figure of a hook with two barbs.
Figure of two broad scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his esteem among people for his skill. So do not disdain to have any instrument prepared, for it will certainly be needed.
Chapter Seventy-Eight.
On extracting the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with white hellebore, and tightly close her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out with this, then fine. Otherwise, take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, oregano, dill, chamomile, wormwood, savory, and centaury. All of these medications, or some of them, immerse them in water, and place them on the fire. Then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said, for the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it little by little until she extracts it. If it is adhered deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, so that when you find the placenta, pull it little by little, gently.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, rather it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling, for then it will respond and be released from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment of the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of violence in pulling it again, but it should be tied to what has come out of it at the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the quadruple ointment, for it will rot it after a few days.
And it dissolves and comes out, except that when it rots, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the patient, so it is necessary to use suitable fumigations.
For that, some of the ancients tried fumigation with the herb and dried figs.  Image of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated when there is retention of menses, placenta, and so on:
It is made of lead resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper.  The thin end is placed in the vulva and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the coals. She holds it until that incense is gone, and repeats with another.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of unopened anal fistula.
Many boys are born with their anuses unopened, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger, or else incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then she should place on it wool dipped in wine and oil, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child needs to defecate.
Blockage of the anus can also occur from the healing of a wound or swelling.  This healed area should be incised, then treated with the aforementioned remedies and lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardness that occurs near the anus externally, or in the perineum on one of its sides.  The fistula may be singular or multiple.
If this thickening persists, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it.  Some of these fistulas may open into the anus and into the intestine, and some may not be open.  Open fistulas can be recognized by the feces and gas that emerge from them when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them. Sometimes, if they are in the perineum, fistulas may open into the bladder and into the urethra, and some of them may open into the hip joint and into the coccyx.  How to distinguish a fistula that opens into the anus from one that does not.
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe made of copper or iron into the fistula if the fistula is not curved. If it is curved, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the opening, neither feces, nor gas, nor worms, as we have said, then know that it is not open, so proceed with treatment.
If the fistula opens into the bladder or into the urethra, the evidence is the passage of urine from it and the inability of the area to heal with medications.  If it opens into the hip joint or into the coccyx, the sign is that the probe reaches there.
If there is no curvature towards the bone, and if there is pain in the area and pus constantly coming out of it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment, then these open fistulas are not curable at all.
Their treatment is a futile effort for any ignorant doctor who attempts them. But those that are not open and not chronic may be hoped to be cured with iron, as I will describe and as I have tested.  You lay the patient before you on his back.
And raise his legs upwards with his thighs inclined towards his belly. Then you insert a copper or lead probe, if there is a curvature in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel in your finger that the probe has emerged by itself, exposed, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is open, so do not bother with it, for it is incurable, as we have said.
They have said that it heals in some rare people.  And among the treatments which may be hoped to be beneficial is that you heat a thin cautery, according to the width of the fistula as described previously, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches the vicinity of the anus. Then you repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess clotted flesh, which resembles the tube of a bird's feather, has been burned. Then you treat it with wicks soaked in oil until the burned flesh comes out. Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  But if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the fistula on the side of the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula. وأنت تمرّ بالشقّ مع المسبار وهو فى الناصور حتّى تبلغ بالشقّ حيث انتهى طرف المسبار ويتخلّص المسبار ويسقط، ثمّ تنقى تلك اللحوم المتلبّدة التى تشبه أنبوب ريش الطير ولا تبقى منه شيئا.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the blood overcomes you and prevents you from working to cut the flesh, the best thing to do, and the quickest benefit, is to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine because cauterizing with fire combines two good things: burning the excess flesh.
And stopping the blood and drying the moisture.  Then treat it with wicks soaked in oil or powdered sulfur with oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are the medicines that have astringency and dryness, for when it has healed, it is cured and will not relapse. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of membrane or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetrating, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation. That is, you employ in it one of three methods: either you cauterize it, as we said,
Or you incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can, by inserting wicks and treatment, be close, and do not overdo the incision, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we have said.
Or you penetrate that barrier and pierce it after you incise it close to the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with another sharp-edged instrument. Then you clean all the clotted flesh that is in the incision to where you are able with thoroughness.
Then dust the entire wound with powder, including the incision and the upper opening, until it seals, and keep the fistula open within the anus, so it will be easier for the patient. The fistula may sometimes perforate in this way.
That is, if you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on one side of the anus toward the surface of the body along with the skin and edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end like a cobbler's needle, in this way:
And insert into it a thread twisted from five threads or so. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it opens into the edge of the anus from the inside nearby.
Then bring the thread out from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bring out the end of the thread. Gather both ends together and tie them, and leave it for a day or two. Every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, unless it is very deep, then you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Image of the pointed scalpel with which fistulas are incised. Its curve is very sharp and the other side is not sharp, so that you do not cut with it what does not need to be cut, as you see:.
Chapter Eighty-One.
On Lancing Hemorrhoids that Bleed, Excising Them, and Treating Fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types. Either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters or like grape seeds, and they are small and large, and blood flows from them constantly.
And they are single and they are many, and they are outside the anus and on its edges, except that those that are outside the anus are mostly less moist, and a yellow fluid or a little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the color of the skin.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is that you order the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the warts appear to you, then you quickly grasp them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, then you cut them at their roots if the hooks will not hold in them due to their moisture and looseness.
Then rub it with a coarse cloth or a piece of rough bread, or pull it with your fingers, then cut it. Then sprinkle on it after cutting some sharp powders to act as cautery for it, or cauterize it as described previously in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the anus does not respond to you for protrusion, then give the patient an enema that has a little pungency to wash what is in the anus, and it will come out quickly when the patient strains. As for external hemorrhoids, their treatment is easy and simple.
And that is that you take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it with what we mentioned until it heals.  And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should try piercing it in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread under the needle while it is transverse, and tighten the wart tightly and firmly, then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the warts, leaving one that you do not pierce.
so that excess blood may flow from it. Then place a cloth dipped in rose oil or cerate on the anus and place it on the anus, and tell the patient to remain still. Then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and constipation. If it becomes chronic and no medicine is effective for it, then it should be scraped with the blade of a scalpel or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping, more severely than the first time, until it bleeds slightly and peels. Then treat it, and it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two
On the Treatment of Ingrown and Non-Ingrown Nails, Dry Warts, and Calluses.
A corn is a round nodule, the color of flesh, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs all over the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the nail, grasped with forceps or a hook, and extracted from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, compact, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
It often occurs on the hands of children. Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or to pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as described previously with fire or a caustic medication.
Ingrown and non-ingrown nails can be removed with the instrument I will describe in the treatment of calluses. As for a callus, it is also a small, compact, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep.  When cold affects it, one feels a sensation similar to the sting of ants.
It occurs all over the body, but mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube made of a goose feather or a strong eagle feather and place that tube over the callus so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the callus.
Insert it deep into the flesh and extract the callus from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be thin, solid, and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to grasp and twist. If you wish, you may cauterize the callus as described previously for cauterizing warts, in the chapter on cautery.

On illustrations of the instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered copper.  This instrument may be made small or large depending on the user. فتكون التى تستعمل فى علاج الصبيان الصغار صغارا والذين مقاعدهم ضيقة او متوجّعة تكون محاقنهم لطافا جدّا، صورة محقن كبير:.
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, should be wide, in this manner, with a rim where the bladder is attached, as you see.  Its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid, very smooth, and thin.  On one side are two holes and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a probe or slightly thicker. The bladder in which the medications are placed is made from an animal bladder or from thin sheepskin, made in the shape of a small wineskin, its diameter being a span.
Many holes are pierced around it, the distance between each hole being the width of a finger. Then, a strong thread of two-ply yarn, of ten threads or so, is passed through these holes, and the bladder is gathered like a wineskin. فإذا وضع فيه الدواء شدّ فى رأس المحقن بين الحجرين شدّا وثيقا ثمّ تحقن به، وهذه صورة دائرة الزقّ والثقب:.
The method of administering the enema is to fill the skin or bladder with the medication, warmed to a temperature the patient can tolerate. Be careful that it is not too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upward.
A mat or blanket is placed under him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek mucilage, or something similar. Then insert it gently into the anus. Then an assistant takes the bladder with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all the contents of the syringe have emptied into the intestine.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medication stimulates him to defecate, let him hold it as long as he can. If he sleeps with it the whole night, it will be more effective. If it is administered for diarrhea and its expulsion is hastened, repeat the enema until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the anus, the syringe should be very smooth, like those used for children. This is an illustration of a smooth syringe with its skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Wounds.
I have mentioned in the section on cauterization the treatment of similar things, and here I will discuss their complete treatment by hand and with medications. I say that wounds differ according to the object causing the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as the blow of a stone, or the cut of a sword or knife, or the thrust of a spear or stick or arrow, and many other such things.
As for wounds according to the locations on the body, they are like the wound that occurs on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and other such organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds so that you can use them as a standard and rule for all other wounds, and I will begin with simple head wounds specifically, because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third book of this work.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, you should examine it. If it is from the blow of a stone or similar object, and the skin is only torn, and the wound is large, and you fear the occurrence of a hot swelling in the patient, then hasten to perform phlebotomy at the appropriate site. ولا تؤخر ذلك وأخرج له من الدم على قدر قوّته إن لم يمنع من الفصد مانع ولا سيّما إن كان الدم الذى يخرج من الجرح يسيرا وليكن الفصد من ضدّ الجهة المجروحة.
Warn the patient against fullness, drink, and coarse foods. If something prevents him from being phlebotomized, then he should reduce his food intake and avoid meat and drinks.  Apply to the wound, if a hot swelling develops in it, cotton dipped in rose oil alone, or with an astringent drink.
If you are sure there is no hot swelling, then dress the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and the air has not changed it, with the powder that I will describe to you shortly.  But if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals.  If the wound is large and is from the cut of a sword or similar object, and its edges do not come together with bandages, then bring it together with sutures as I will describe in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin has peeled back, exposing the bone, and is attached only by a small piece, cut it off, then treat the wound with medications that will generate solid flesh in place of the skin. Instruct the patient to eat strengthening foods like heads, porridges and the like.
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the putrefied part and discard it, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with medication, search for the artery/vein.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with a scalpel and tie it off. If necessary, if what we have mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy, it is sufficient to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bloody.
Before the air changes them. The recipe for the powder is: take one part frankincense, two parts mastic, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime. Grind all together, sift, and pack it into the wound, and bandage tightly so that it adheres well.
It will congeal with the blood. Then bandage it over with compresses and leave it undressed as long as it does not swell, for the medication will not come off until it heals. Lime alone can be used for this, if you do not have frankincense and mastic.
This same action can also be performed with bandages on many large wounds if it is applied skillfully and bandaged tightly, and the wounds are fresh with blood that has not been altered by the air. However, if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is summertime...
...then applying this powder is pointless. Treat it as we have mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus forms. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
If, however, a slight bone fracture occurs with the wound, then set it with splints. I have described the treatment of skull fractures previously, in the section on neck surgery. Now, if the wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
However, if a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no other recourse but to avoid treating it with anything strongly astringent, such as verdigris, vitriol, and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
Nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  And what you treat it with should be softening medications, such as nūra washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose oil and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water, and all the metallic stones in this manner and moist ointments. However, if the wound is large, use sutures or bring its edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and an abscess has formed at its bottom where pus has collected, lance it at its lowest point. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you find its blood flowing, cauterize it, ligate it, or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the jugular veins are intact, bring together the edges of the skin with sutures over the trachea. Do not touch the larynx, but smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it. If there are bone fragments, extract them all, or as many as possible.  And what you cannot extract, leave it until the wound putrefies, heals, and its removal becomes easy.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powders that we have described. If the bone putrefies in the wound and becomes a fistula, treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter, on surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife and you see that it is deep, observe.  If air comes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it is a fatal wound. If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood, do not put powders in it at first, and do not bind it so that blood is not trapped in its depth.
It would be driven back to the heart and kill the patient. But put in it a drawing ointment and change it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, place a piece of worn cotton at the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes out of it, and have the patient sleep on the wounded side.
So that whatever gathers in it will drain.  And if three or more days have passed since the injury, and the patient has not developed convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that all his other conditions are good, know that the wound is healthy. Treat it with bandaging and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see it, and the stench continues, know that it has become a fistula, so treat it according to its chapter. [Have] the patient [lie] on the wound so that whatever gathers in it will drain.  And if it has passed to a wound of the chest or back, treat it with the suturing we have previously described.
If it is large, or with powders if it is small.  If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, examine the wound and proceed to remove those fragments if they are loose.  If they are not loose, leave them until...
the wound putrefies, for it will be easier to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the same rules as we have described.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On Wounds of the Abdomen, Protrusion of the Intestines, and Their Suturing.
The rupture that occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  From a large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, and their repositioning and suturing is more difficult and complicated.
The small rupture is also difficult in another way, requiring a more complicated repositioning.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it will swell and thicken, making its repositioning difficult. Therefore, the best rupture is the medium-sized one because the repositioning of the intestine is not as difficult as with these two types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types. Two types of sutures are general and suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body. The other two types are specific, common to all wounds, except that they are more specific to suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one, with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has come out and its repositioning is difficult, that is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said, or because the intestine has become swollen due to the coldness of the air.
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in which has been boiled spikenard, rue, and spikenard, and dabbing the intestine with it until the swelling subsides.
This can also be done with a drink that has astringency, which is better than water alone in reducing swelling.  When you see that the swelling has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled, as this will make it easier to insert.
If its return is difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision.  The incision is only resorted to after necessity and exhaustion of other options.  This is the image of the instrument:.
One of its curved sides is sharp, the other is blunt, and the thin end is not as thin as a scalpel, but rather slightly blunted. It is an instrument resembling a small probe, as you see. If the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its proper place, if you are able to do so, is best. But if the rupture is large and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and put his legs higher than his head, and if it is in the upper abdomen, he should put his head and chest higher than his lower body.
And likewise, if the rupture is on one of the sides of the abdomen, always make your intention and purpose to have the side where the surgery is higher than the other side.  And this is how it should be done in major surgeries and in moderate surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, place him as best you can. Then have an assistant at hand, a gentle one, hold the entire rupture with his hands and bring the edges together, then reveal a little bit at a time to the one performing the stitching.
This is the method for the single common suture: take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space the width of the little finger from the edge of the rupture and insert a single needle, without any thread in it, into the edges of the skin. مع حافتى الصفاق الذى تحت الجلد من داخل حتّى تنفذها من تلك الناحية وقد جمعت حاشيتى الجلد وحاشيتى الصفاق وصارت أربع طاقات، ثمّ تشدّ بخيط مثنّى حول الإبرة مرّات من الجهتين جميعا حتّى تجتمع شفتا الجرح اجتماعا محكما.
Then leave a space the width of a finger and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the needles you need until you have completely sewn up the wound.  The needles should be of medium thickness, between thick and thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be medium in thickness, between thin and thick. And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
So that the flesh does not quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  And do not sew too far apart, lest the wound be prevented from healing. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient while he sleeps, and make for him supports of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because it is sufficient to sew them with one needle or two or so.
The manner of the common, or layman's, suture is to bring together the four edges, that is, the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thinness and thickness. Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, you return the needle through the same side from which you began.
So the thread lies intertwined on top of the wound, the stitching being like the stitching of sacks that are used to tie up goods.  And you should leave the space of a small finger's width between each stitch. This stitching is known to everyone.
With this stitching I sewed a wound in a man's belly. He had been wounded with a knife, and the tear of the wound was more than a span, and about two spans of his middle intestine had come out. The tear was in the middle of the belly.
I put it back in after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived after that for many years, managing all his affairs.  The doctors had judged that he would certainly not recover.
It is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there was no medicine. I would place worn-out cotton on the wound twice a day and make sure to wash it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to the text of Galen: that you begin stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside. Once you have passed the needle through the skin and through the muscle running lengthwise along the entire abdomen...
...leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle. Then pass the needle through its other edge, from the inside to the outside, on the other edge of the peritoneum. Once you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum, from the outside to the inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum that is on this side and pass the needle through its other edge, from the inside to the outside. As you pass it through the peritoneum, pass it through the edge of the peritoneum that is on its side, until it passes all the way through it.
Then begin again from this same side and sew it with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side. Bring the needle out from the skin that is next to it. Then return it to that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum that is on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out from the skin that is on its side.  Do this again and repeat it until you have sewn the entire wound according to this example. The overall description of this suture is that you sew like furriers sew furs.
Sew the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once on the other side until you are finished. As for the second type of specific suture that Galen also mentioned, these are his words verbatim.
It is that you sew it similar to how some practitioners sew, in that they bring together each part to its naturally corresponding similar part.  So, they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the omentum to its other edge, and that is as I will describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the omentum closest to you from the outside and pass it inwards into it alone, leaving the two edges of the peritoneum.  Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside into both edges of the peritoneum.  Then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside into the other edge of the omentum which is on the opposite side. This type of suture is better than the common, easy suture, which is the suture mentioned previously. These are the words of Galen verbatim.  Some have said that suturing of the abdomen may be performed with two needles. وذلك أن تدخل فيهما خيطا واحدا وتبدأ بإدخال الإبرة من عندك وتنفذها الى الجانب الآخر وتدخل الإبرة الأخرى من الجانب المقابل له فتنفذها من عندك على حسب خياطة الأساكفة سواء.
And know that if the perforation is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suturing is more difficult than in other areas of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its management in its treatment is the same as the management of other wounds, that is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and suture it and secure it, then apply the desiccating, healing powders to it.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the sutures fall off and the peritoneum and omentum heal.  Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines available, then apply worn cotton to it from the time it begins to suppurate, and change it twice a day, as I have instructed you, until it heals.  You will not need any other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple.  If you fear that the principal organs might share in the pain of the wound,
then you should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit.  If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often happens, then inject him with a tepid, black, astringent syrup.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that whatever part of the intestines is thick, it is easier to heal, and whatever part of them is thin, it is more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all, due to the abundance of its vessels and their size, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum and you find it soft, then return it just as you return the intestine.
If some time has passed and it has become green or black, then you should tie it with a thread above the place where it has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum. Then cut what is below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  Mentioning the wound that occurs in the intestine.  Now, if a small tear occurs in the intestine...
It is possible that it may heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his belly by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and gas emerged.  I began to treat him although I did not expect him to heal. فلم أزل ألاطفه حتّى برئ والتحم الموضع، فلمّا رأيت الموضع قد التحم خشيت على العليل أن يحدث عليه حادث سوء فى جوفه فلم يعرض له من ذلك حادث سوء البتّة وبقى فى أفضل أحواله.
That is, large-headed ants should be taken, then the edges of the wound brought together, then one of these ants, with its mouth open, should be placed on the edges of the wound. When it grips it and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it adheres and does not dissolve. Then another ant is placed near the first.
You continue to do this with a number of ants according to the size of the wound, then return it and sew the wound.  Those heads remain adhering to the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm happens to the patient at all.  It is also possible to sew the intestine with fine thread.
which is drawn from the mesentery of the animal attached to it after it is threaded into a needle.  That is, the end of this thread from the mesentery is drawn gently, then a thin, twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle. وفيه خيط المصران فيخاط به المعاء ثمّ يردّ الى الجوف، وهذا الضرب من الخياطة بالنمل والمصران إنّما هو على طريق الطمع والرجاء.
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it, nor is there any cure at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the Treatment of Coryza and Fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and it constantly suppurates without ceasing, it is called in general, in whatever limb it may be, a fistula, and we call it coryza, and the fistula.
It is in reality a hard, solid, white concretion, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
And for this reason some have called it a feather, and it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be copious or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its lips that prevents the growth of good flesh. وإمّا أنّها كثيرة الوضر والوسخ وإمّا لأنّ القرحة فى نفسها عفنة والمادّة التى تمدّها رديئة الكيفيّة وإمّا لأنّ الدواء غير موافق فى علاجها وإمّا لفساد وقع فى البلدة من جنس الوبأ وإمّا لخاصّة فى البلدة.
Or it is very dirty and filthy, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that supplies it is of poor quality, or because the medication is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a particular characteristic of the town. كما عرض فى مدينة سرقسطة التى يعسر فيها نضج الأمراض ويبطئ فيها برء الأورام بالطبع وإمّا لأنّ فيها عظما واحدا او عدّة عظام، وقد بيّنت جميع هذه الأسباب وعلاماتها وعلاجاتها بالأدوية فى التقسيم.
And it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistulas and nasal catarrh, which is by manual operation. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body. Some fistulas end at large veins and arteries or at a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the back, or to a joint of the many-jointed joints, such as the hand and the foot, and some of them lead to near a principal organ and so forth.
So what is of these fistulas of this description are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance. If there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I mentioned, and I hoped and aspired to treat them.
And you wanted to reach the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula runs straight, then examine it with it. If there is a curvature in the fistula, then examine it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body.
So it slips upon entry and bends towards the curvature. If the fistula has many openings, you cannot investigate them with the probe, so inject one of its openings, for the moisture that you inject with it will travel towards the other openings and flow out.
From them, then investigate thoroughly in any way you can, so that you know if there is a bone or a nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Understand all of that to the best of your ability by inquiring of the sick person about the presence of pain when you press your hand on the place.
And such as that of the signs and causes incidental to the swelling. So, if you understand all of that with certainty, then at that time proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you consider, if it is.
The fistula is superficial and near, or in a healthy place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what preceded in my description, and extract what is in it of induration, corrupt flesh, and excess flesh.
And what grows in its opening of flesh or caruncle, and such as that, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated, and it is straight, it is appropriate that you incise it in the depth as much as you can, then cleanse it from all of its corrupt flesh.
Then use twisted pledgets dipped in sharp medications and insert them to the bottom of the fistula, which you reach with the iron instrument.  Do this to it repeatedly until that sharp medication consumes all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption.
Then dress it with the ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.  If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what preceded its description.  If the cause of the fistula is bone, and that is confirmed for you, then explore it and incise it according to what I informed you, if a preventative does not prevent you from that.
A vessel or nerve, or a principal organ as we said.  If the bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what makes it heal until it heals.  If it does not heal and pus continues as it was doing,
then know that you did not reach all of the removal of the corruption.  Expose all that is on it again and be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.  If it heals, then good, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess of corruption, expose all that is on it again.
And be thorough in its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort.  If the corrupt bone is a small bone and you are able to extract it, then extract it with the delicate hooks which are suited for that.
If they are many bones, then be thorough in extracting them all, and do not leave anything of them to the best of your ability.  If something of the ligaments obstructs you before them, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh, if there is any there, and free the bones.
If you are unable to extract the bones at this time, then apply to the wound what will make it putrefy and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. And protect the wound so that the incision that you made during your work does not close.
Rather, if you fear that, place upon it cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For if those ligaments putrefy and the bones are freed, it will be easy to extract and pull them.
If it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what has become corrupt of it is its surface only, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then treat the wound. If what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it.
And cut it all the way to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.  And I will tell you about a case that occurred to a man in his leg, for you to take it as an example and aid in your treatment.  This man was young in age.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause that affected him from inside the body until the substances reached the leg, and it swelled with a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with errors by the doctors until the swelling opened.
And many substances flowed from it, and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became putrid and developed many openings, all of which exuded pus and bodily fluids. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, and among them was no one skilled in surgery.
Until they came to me, and I saw his leg, and the substances were flowing profusely from those openings, and the man's body had become thin, and his color yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all of the openings.
And I found them leading to one another from all sides of the leg, so I proceeded and made an incision on one of the openings until I exposed some of the bone.  I found it corrupt, eroded, blackened, putrefied and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow.  So I widened what was exposed to me.
And I dealt with the corrupt bone, thinking that there was no other corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and exposed, and that I had eradicated it. Then I began to dress the wound with healing medications for a long period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and exposed the bone again, above the first exposure.
And I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I also exposed what appeared to me of that corruption. Then I tried to heal it, but it neither healed nor closed. Then I examined it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and tried to heal it, but it did not heal, until I had cut off about a span of the bone.
And I removed it with its marrow, then I dressed it with medications, and it healed quickly and he recovered. This repetition in the procedure and incisions was necessary because of the patient's weakness and low tolerance, and my fear of his death, because he was experiencing severe fainting from excessive vomiting at all times.  Then he recovered completely.
And solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body was restored to health, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs.  And he did not experience any harmful affliction in walking whatsoever. If a protruding bone in a part of the body is broken…
It should be exposed in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, and have someone pull it upwards. Then use another bandage, made of wool thicker than the first bandage.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards. Meanwhile, you expose the flesh from the place you want to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.  Place a piece of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be hindered from cutting the corrupted bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the corrupted area so that there is no corruption within the cavity of the bone which is not apparent on the surface, forcing you to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, but rather connected together, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath and saw it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said.  If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy other than scraping.  If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should scrape the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and clean it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever method works for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve. Know that the chisels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their placement, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. فلذلك ينبغى أن تعدّ لكلّ نوع من العمل آلة مشاكلة لذلك العمل.
And know that the procedures themselves may guide you to the type of instrument that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever has mastered the craft has witnessed various kinds of diseases. فقد يستنبط لنفسه ما يشاكله من الآلات لكلّ مرض وأنا مصوّر لك فى آخر هذاالباب عدّةآلات.

Chapter eighty-seven.
On the amputation of limbs and sawing of bones.
Limbs may become gangrenous, either from an external cause or an internal one. If you have treated this corruption with medicinal treatment, and the treatment has not been successful, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it.
Then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death, or from a great affliction that is greater than the loss of the limb.  And the sign of what has happened to him is that the limb blackens until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it putrefies after the blackness until that putrefaction spreads to what is next to that limb and takes over the whole body, so hasten to amputate it. Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, or a viper, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  And likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, then amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in the two bones of the arm.
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm, then amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. But if the corruption has spread and you see it has reached towards the shoulder, then do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient.  And use other treatment to the extent possible.
And likewise, you do with the foot: if the corruption has taken hold in the toe, then amputate the toe at one of the phalanges. And if it has taken hold in the metatarsus of the foot, then amputate the entire foot. If it has ascended to the knee, then amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death. The method of amputating the limb or excising it is to tie a ligature below the place you want to amputate and tie another ligature above the place.
And an assistant stretches the one ligature downwards, and another assistant stretches the upper ligature upwards, and you expose the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is amputated or excised. And it is necessary to place linen rags on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the healthy area, which would cause the patient additional pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some styptic powders, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about an example: this same condition that I am describing to you occurred in a man's leg, namely, blackness appeared in his leg with a burning sensation resembling fire.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took the entire leg. So the man hastened, on his own, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he was experiencing, to amputate it at the joint and he recovered.
Then, after a long time had passed, this same corruption appeared in his index finger, so he came to me. I intended to repel that excess with the medicines that I applied to the hand after cleansing his body, but the excess was not repelled and began to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption spread in the hand, he asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused him, hoping that I could repel that excess, and I also feared death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing. So, when he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then I heard about him that he hastened to amputate his entire hand and recovered. I have told this story only so that it may be of help in cases of this kind of disease and so that it may be a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medications.
If a swelling occurs in some fleshy organ and the swelling lasts for a long time until it gathers pus, then bursts open or is lanced, and all the pus that was in it comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin over it, like a rag, has thinned and the corruption has not reached the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament, and for this reason it deserves to be called a fistula.  It is not called a deep fistula unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects one of these organs.
Then it is called a deep fistula or an ulcer. Its treatment is to cut all of that skin around it, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
If you hope that the skin will adhere, and the corruption has not reached that extent, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an injection.  That is, you examine the fistula, and if it is large, and the pus that flows from it has a foul odor, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, combined in a vessel and cooked over a fire until the medicine thickens and becomes as thick as honey. Then take what you need from it and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and tie its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then expel it by squeezing. Do this for days until the fistula cleanses and the foul odor disappears. It may also be injected with lye water if this medicine is not available, and that is that you take the ash of vine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed.  If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor lye water, then inject him with water and honey mixed with a little powdered verdigris.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine to adhere the fistula, especially if the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.  So when you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula is gone, then inject it with what will generate flesh in it.
Such as taking some of the date palm ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose recipes we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow, not wide enough for the injection tube,
then widen it slightly with the iron, or place in it a wick soaked in the Egyptian ointment or the squirting cucumber ointment until it widens.  Likewise, if the opening is too wide, bring its lips together with stitching, and leave an opening just large enough for the injection tube to enter, and no more.
And similarly, if its mouth from which the pus flows is elevated, then cut it at its lowest point so that the pus will drain downwards, because if pus collects in the depths of the fistula, it will prevent flesh from growing in it.
If you cannot cut the fistula downwards as you wish, then you must position the limb in a way that the pus flows easily, as best you can, and be careful that none of the pus is retained at all.
As for the healing medications that are placed on the fistula externally, and how to place them on it: you should take one of the healing ointments appropriate for what you need, and spread it on a linen cloth. The cloth should be large enough to cover the entire fistula. ثمّ تقرض بالمقصّ قبالة فم المخبأ ثقبة أوسع من فم المخبأ قليلا ثمّ تمدّ من المراهم اللينة على خرقة أخرى على قدر الثقب وتضعها عليها وضعا متباعدا عن فم المخبأ ليسهل خروج القيح منه ولا تزيل الخرقة الكبيرة إلّا بعد.
several days.  As for the one on the mouth of the fistula, you should remove it frequently to let out the accumulated pus, and to determine whether the discharge flowing from it is copious or scant, mature or immature.
In addition to this, also examine the site of the fistula itself: does the patient feel pain there or not, and is there swelling or not?  When your treatment has continued in this way, and you see that the matter exiting the mouth of the fistula is slight,
know that the fistula has closed, or is about to close. Then undo it the next day, or on the third day. And when you undo the wound, replace the cloths with others, and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its closing.
Its healing is near, because the growth of flesh in some people's wounds is slow, while in others it is the opposite.  If, after many days, immature pus emerges from the fistula, know that the fistula has not closed. If the closing of the fistula is delayed,
and the matter is prolonged, increase the desiccating medications.  Let the medications be moist in consistency, and dry in potency, such as the palm ointment, especially if an extra amount of litharge has been added. Among the most effective treatments is to take the palm ointment
and dissolve it with rose oil, sprinkle it with old, moderately consistent wine, then knead it with it and use it.  You can do the same thing if you don't have palm ointment, by using honey, cooked until it thickens, or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all together, and sprinkle them on the honey while it is on the fire. ثمّ تطليه على خرقة وتشدّه على المخبأ او يطلى بالعسل الذى طبخته حتّى يغلظ وتذرّ عليه العقاقير وتضع عليه الخرق وتشدّه.
Aristolochia longa, orris root, garden cress flour, and centaury can be used in similar fashion, either individually or combined. Grind and sift them, sprinkle them on the honey as described, and use it. If the fistula persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is deep corruption.
And if it has affected the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as a fistula as described above.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the treatment of an ingrown nail, a bruised nail, amputating extra fingers, and separating webbed fingers.
An ingrown nail is excess flesh that grows under the thumbnail or toenail, and sometimes grows under other nails. If it is neglected and left untreated, it swells into a hot, inflamed lump.
Or pus develops until it erodes the base of the nail, and sometimes destroys it completely, and sometimes the infection reaches the bone until it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes livid. If you treat it as described in the chapter on incisions and your treatment is not successful.
Then you should cut away with a knife all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization in this case is very beneficial.  However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,
and the corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and caused it to be pricked and hurt, then you should place a thin probe under the corner of the nail that is pricking the flesh and lift it up, and gently cut away that flesh.
And apply to the remaining flesh some of the caustic burning medications until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the infection has affected the bone, then you should cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is any diseased bone in it at all.
If you see the erosion and infection spreading in the finger, then amputate it at one of the phalanges as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals.  If the nail receives a blow or crush and severe pain occurs in it, then you should first bleed the patient.
Then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh under the nail with the incision, for you will thereby cause the patient severe pain, and it will be a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the area. Then treat the area with what relieves pain.
As for the extra finger that develops on some people's hands, it is sometimes entirely fleshy, and sometimes it has bones in it, and sometimes it has a nail, and some of them grow at the base of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or they may grow on one of the phalanges of the finger, and those that grow on one of the phalanges of the finger do not move, while those that grow at the joint of the finger may move. So what is entirely fleshy, cutting it is easy, and that is that you cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.
As for those that grow at the base of the joint, their treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting them.  As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, you should first cut the flesh around it circularly down to the bone, then saw the bone with one of the appropriate saws.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that occurs between fingers, it often happens, and it can be something a person is born with, or it can happen when a wound or burn heals, and so on. You should incise that adhesion.
until the fingers return to their natural state. Then place between them lint or rags soaked in rose oil so that it does not quickly adhere, and separate them, or put a thin lead plate between them until the area heals as it should.
And similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is possible and what will restore the proper form of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins filled with black morbid matter. They occur in most parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, especially in porters, bath attendants, and grape harvesters. It is best to first employ strong purges of black bile several times.
Then bleed the patient from the basilic vein. As for treatment with iron, it is of two types: one is to incise and drain the black blood, and the other is to extract the entire vein. As for incising it, it is done in this way: first foment the leg well with hot water.
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then tie the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a turban, then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then milk out the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until you extract the amount of blood that you see is sufficient, or what the patient's strength can bear. Then bandage it and order him to avoid foods that generate black bile, and repeat the purging and bleeding.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, as for extracting it, it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is a lot of hair, then have him enter the bath and foment his leg with hot water until it reddens and the vein swells, or have him exercise vigorously.
If a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed, then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or below it near the heel, then open the skin with hooks and peel the vein from all sides until it can be felt.
And when it appears, you will see it intensely red, and when it is free from the skin, you will also see it as if it were a tendon. Then insert a probe underneath it so that when it rises and emerges from the skin, you can hook it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers away.
Then peel the skin from the vein until it appears, then lift it with the probe as you did before and hook it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions, if you need to.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, so that when it is all out, cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe under it and rotate it with your hand in every direction until it comes out. Be careful not to break it, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
And harm will come to the patient from it. So when you have extracted all of it, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil or oil on the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is convoluted with twists and turns in different directions.
And it is not straight as we have described, it is necessary to incise it at every twist and turn. Then hook it with the hooks until you extract all of it.  Be careful when you incise it not to cut the vein or injure it, for it will be difficult for you to extract it. So be very careful.
Image of the lancet with which you incise the varix:
Image of the blunt hook:
It should not be curved like other hooks, and it should not be sharp at the tip, lest it injure the vein. It should have a thick bend and be smooth, because if it were thin it would cut the vein with its thinness. Rather, it should have extra thickness, as we have said.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On the Excision of a Varicose Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren countries of little fertility, and sometimes it develops in other places of the body besides the legs, and it is generated by putrefaction that occurs under the skin.
Just as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, pumpkin rot, and worms generated between the skin and flesh. And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells up, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two, and tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
And whenever something comes out of it, you wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, and do not cut it off from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, so it causes swelling and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body. And from this vein in some people may come out what is five or ten spans in length.
And I have heard that it came out of a man twenty spans. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and pack it with a long packing along with the body until all the matter in it is emptied, and try to purify the place with medications for days.
Then treat it with the treatment for swellings. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, so it develops many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening, so treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called the disease of cattle.
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps throughout the whole body, ascending and descending.
It is perceptible to the senses when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces wherever it pierces a place in the skin and emerges.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as happens with worms and snakes and pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.
The harm expected from it is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may perhaps open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often. So if you want to treat it and remove it, this is only possible when it creeps and its appearance is perceptible to the senses.
It is necessary that you tightly bind above it and below it with a good, tight ligature, then incise upon it and take it out. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cautery with fire to the place until you burn it.  The greatest harm expected from it is the destruction of the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has gone into the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise upon it and take it out.  It is necessary that the patient attends to purifying his body with medications that purge putrid, bad humors and be careful of foods that generate putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On Incising the Disease Known as al-Nafir (The Fleeing).
This disease, which is called al-nafir (the fleeing) in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the organs, then moves from organ to organ, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was called to a sick woman in a rural area, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the arm's tendon. When I remained for an hour, I saw that swelling creeping along the forearm as a worm creeps, rising to her shoulder blade as quickly as could be, like mercury.
If it flowed from one place to another, the pain would disappear from that place and settle in the shoulder blade.  Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout her body until it was in the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, just as I had witnessed.
I marveled at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a group of people who found the pain moving from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I did not consider that to be anything other than because the woman was from the rural people, dry of body, with exposed veins, and therefore this moving wind appeared to the senses. And it must be that it does not appear to this degree in people of luxury and moist bodies with hidden veins.
If you want to treat it, and its possessor feels the pain, then if it appears to you visually, as we mentioned, quickly tie above and below it and incise over it until that trapped wind comes out, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with what expels and dissipates the winds, such as asafoetida, sagapenum, and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On Extracting Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in which they occur in the body. As for their difference according to their types, some of them are large and small, some are hollow glass and solid glass, and some of them have three angles and four angles.
And some of them have tongues, and some of them have splinters. As for those that are according to the organs in which they occur, they are of two types: either the organs are among the principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. فمتى وقع سهم فى أحد هذه الأعضاء وظهرت لك علامات الموت التى أنا واصفها لك بعد فينبغى أن تجتنب إخراج ذلك السهم منها فإنّ الموت يلحق صاحبها فى أكثر الأحوال.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that. وحمرة فى العينين وحمرة اللسان وتشنّج واختلاط عقل وقذف مرّة وربّما خرج الدم من المنخرين او الأذنين وربّما انقطع الكلام وذهب الصوت وخرج من موضع الجرح رطوبة بيضاء تشبه العصيدة ويجرى منها مثل مائيّة اللحم.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs of the arrow if it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast, it feels as if it has been embedded in something solid, not in something empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitably descending.  And the sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the emergence of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm that is in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows it, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes out of the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, some undigested food may come out of the wound.
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and sticks in it, and something of the stool comes out of the wound, or the omentum, or an intestine has been perforated, then there is no hope in treating him nor in removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine comes out.
And if something protrudes from it to the outside, and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is perishing. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are most often safe.
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may be guided by it in your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of his nose.
I extracted it for him from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered and no harm happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the corner of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had disappeared, and I could only find its small end that attaches to the shaft.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with smooth, square iron, and it had no barbs. The Jew recovered, and no ill befel his eye. I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian.
It is the one with two barbs. I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. I treated him gently until I extracted it, and the Christian survived and recovered. I extracted another arrow for a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we thought that he would die from it.
When he remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing in his condition changed, I made an incision over the arrow and worked on it carefully, and I extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill befel him. I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound closed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow came out at the top of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and it remained without him feeling much pain. And of such cases there are many. I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the sultan's commanders, who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had deviated slightly to the right side.
And the entire arrow disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck him. I found the arrow's wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it.  He felt a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the tip of the arrow.  So I dressed the area with a dressing that had the power to draw and ripen, hoping that the area would swell and a sign of the arrow would appear, so that I could make an incision over it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot.
So I continued with the dressing on it for many days, but nothing happened. Then during that time the wound closed and the patient remained despairing of its removal for a period, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He told me the news, so I applied the sharp, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it. I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the shaft.  Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medication until the tip of the arrow became clearly visible to us. This took me a period of time, about four months.
Then when the wound widened and it became possible for me to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out. I continued to coax it and try various instruments on it, until one day I grasped it with well-made hooks, the image of which will come at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians were certain that the cartilage of his nose would not heal. But I treated it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, not harmed at all. I am informing you of the method of extracting some arrows so that you may use that as a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the details and particulars of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass it. Rather, the skilled practitioner extrapolates from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new procedure and a new instrument for unusual incidents.
Concerning the extraction of arrows from this profession, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side.  Those which are extracted from where they entered...
...if the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, it is pulled and extracted. If it does not yield to extraction at the time it occurred, then you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easy to pull and extract. Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.
And if it does not yield to extraction, also leave it for days and try pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to extraction after several days, then you should perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine perforator until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and extract it.
If the arrow is lodged in the bone of the skull and has penetrated deep into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms I have mentioned appear in the patient, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until his condition becomes clear after several days.
then attempt to pull and extract the arrow. If it is firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, then use the perforators around the arrow as I have described to you, and then treat the area until it heals.  But if the arrow is embedded in some part of the body... وغاب عن الحسّ ففتّشه بالمسبار فإن أحسست به فاجذبه ببعض الآلات التى تصلح لجذبه فإن لم تستطع عليه لضيق الجرح ولبعد السهم فى الغور ولم يكن هثاك عظم ولا عصب ولا عرق.
then enlarge the wound by incising it so that you can reach the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by whatever means you can. If you are unable to free the flesh, try to break the barbs and twist them until you free them.
When you attempt to extract the arrow, wherever it may be, twist your hand with the hooks in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do so immediately...
then leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies, then try again, for it will then be easier. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter. Take great care not to cut a vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.
By whatever means you can, extract the arrow, but do so gently, slowly, and steadily as I have described to you. When you pull the arrow, it is best to position the patient in the same way they were when the arrow struck them.
If you cannot do this, then use whatever position you can. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a part of it will have protruded outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow close to the surface of the skin by feeling it and you will see it bulging.
Make an incision over it, just large enough to fit the hooks, then pull it, for it will be easy to extract. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion so that the arrow affects the bone and widens the space for itself, then pull it.
If not, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow's shaft is still attached, push on it.  If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the notch of the arrowhead, then push with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into the hollow, as this will make the arrow easier to extract.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that the poison has reached, if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be probed and you can make an incision over it, then make an incision, taking care not to cut any vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the hooks with which arrows are extracted:.
Their ends are like a bird's beak, made like a file; when they grip the arrow or something, they do not let go.  They are made in large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow pusher:.
Image of the solid pusher:.
This one has a solid end like a probe so that it easily enters the hollow arrow and pushes it.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On Phlebotomy.
The veins that are customarily phlebotomized in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the hissing ones, and the two arteries that are in the temples, the apparent ones, and the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes known as the onlookers.
And the vein that rises in the middle of the forehead and the vein that is at the tip of the nose and the two jugular veins that are in the neck and the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth and the two veins that are in the lower lip, these veins being known as the Jaharik, and the two veins that are under the tongue.
And as for the veins that are phlebotomized in the arm and hand, they are five veins, one of which is the Cephalic, which is on the lateral side, and the common people call it the vein of the head, and the Basilic, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, which is located on the medial side, and is also called the Axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen, and the ligament of the arm, which is located on the ulna, which is what it adheres to, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb, and the Median Cubital.
And it is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, it has two branches.  And in the leg and foot are three veins, one of which is that which is below the knee joint on the lateral side, and the second is the Saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the medial side, and the Sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel on the lateral side.
And in the other leg are three veins like them. As for the two veins that are behind the ears, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic catarrh, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant ulcers of the head.  And the manner of their phlebotomy is as I describe.
And it is that you shave the head of the sick person and rub the back of it in the area of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing it well, then the sick person constricts his neck with a turban until the two veins appear, and their place is behind the ears in the depressed areas of the head.  Then you feel for them with your finger, and where you sense their pulsation under your finger, there you make a mark with ink.
Then you take a scalpel, which is known as the Nashal, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone.  Then you lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a complete cut, and the length of the cut is the extent of two closed fingers.
Or thereabouts, and you let out the amount of blood that you desire.  Then you bandage them with compresses and leave them until they heal.  And it has preceded, in the beginning of the book, their cutting and cauterization.  As for the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic migraine and severe headache and persistent ophthalmia and the flow of acute humors pouring into the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe to you: the sick person tightens his neck with a turban until the two veins appear clearly to the senses, and their pulse becomes evident under your finger. Then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the Nashal scalpel from below and lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need. Then you loosen the sick person's constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a compress on it and bandage it tightly from above and leave it until it heals. And their mention, cutting, and probing have preceded in the beginning of the book.  As for phlebotomy of the forehead vein, its benefit, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for chronic ailments of the face, such as ringworm, ulcers, and troublesome redness.
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe to you: The sick person constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then you take the instrument that is called the "axe," and this is its picture:.
You place the projecting thorn that is at the head of the "axe" on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar to it.  You let the blood flow to the extent that you desire. Then you loosen the sick person's constriction and bandage him until he heals.
It may be opened with a broad scalpel, except that the scalpel should not be sharp-tipped like other scalpels, but rather it should be slightly broad-tipped.  And you phlebotomize it obliquely, because the bone is close, so perhaps the scalpel would break in it if it were thin.
As for the two veins that are at the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for ailments of the eye, such as scabies, redness, eyelashes, and diseases of the face.  As for the way to phlebotomize them, it is that the sick person constricts his neck with a turban. Then you phlebotomize them while you are standing at his head. And let the phlebotomy be slightly oblique lengthwise with a small, slightly broad scalpel.
For the place has no flesh in it, so if the scalpel were thin-tipped, it might break. Then you let out the blood you need and place cotton on them and bandage them for one night.  Then you loosen them. As for the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever.
and severe headache and from diseases of the face, such as the red swelling that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic. The way to phlebotomize it is that the sick person constricts his neck. Then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
And you insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose itself, between the partition of the nose, directly, because the vein is not perceptible to the touch there. For the blood emerges immediately.  And you should push your hand with the scalpel in a little and let out the amount of blood needed.  Then bandage it for a night, for it heals quickly.
As for the external jugular veins, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for shortness of breath and the beginning of leprosy and melancholic diseases that occur on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, impetigo, malignant ulcers, and corroding sores. The method of their phlebotomy is that the patient constricts beneath them, on his neck, with a bandage, and the practitioner stands at the patient's head.
The patient is sitting on a chair. Then you phlebotomize the vein lengthwise, a somewhat wide phlebotomy.  Then you draw out a moderate amount of blood or according to what you see is needed.  Then you do the same with the other vein. Then you loosen the bandage.
And you bandage the two veins with a moderate tightness so that the patient does not choke.  And you leave him until the next day, for the wound heals. As for the veins beneath the tongue, the benefit of their phlebotomy after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it benefits thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, malignant ulcers, chapped lips, and malignant sores.
which are in the nose and around it.  And the way to phlebotomize them is that you sit the patient in front of you and tighten his neck with a turban. Then you turn his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see on the right of the lip and the other on its left, and you distinguish them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are thin black veins, so you cut them with a blunt cut. If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and most visible of them. And likewise, do the same with the two veins that are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit of their phlebotomy after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the angina that is in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  And the way to phlebotomize them is that you sit the patient between your hands, facing the sun, and you lift his tongue, and you look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein, and their color is blackish.
Then you phlebotomize them, and be careful not to cut them too deeply, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps bleeding from those arteries may occur. As for the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, they are the ones that it is customary to phlebotomize in all people, and their phlebotomy is in two ways.
Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet or an olive-leaf lancet, down to the thin one, or by incising with a scalpel lancet, which is the nashl [and this is its picture]. Picture of the broad myrtle-leaf lancet:
It is broad, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood. And this is a picture of the olive-leaf lancet:
This lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for phlebotomizing thin veins which contain thin, choleric blood.  And this is a picture of the nashl lancet:
This is the nashl, which is suitable for incising, and there are types of it, broad and thin, according to the width and narrowness of the veins.  And one can infer from this about others, and it is well known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from ailments that are below the throat and neck, from the side of the chest and abdomen. And the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy, should be cautious of it and take care, for beneath it is an artery. If he errs and inserts the lancet too deeply, he will sever that artery.
This will cause bleeding, therefore its phlebotomy should not be with a piercing lancet, but rather it should be incised with the nashl. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it should be avoided and another vein selected or one of its branches sought.
Or, phlebotomize the cephalic vein in its place, for it is visible, and incise it with the nashl lancet as we have said. If you wish to phlebotomize the basilic vein itself, then, before tying the arm, you should palpate the area until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and incise the vein obliquely with the nashl lancet as we have said, and take care that the incision falls far from the location of the artery.  Whenever, upon tightening the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the distension of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon phlebotomy, spurt like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is from the artery. Then, immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, as it often does, then bandage the arm.
Leave it and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be supported and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and overpowers you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then cauterize the artery if it is visible to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will cease.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, take one half, and tie it tightly over the site of the vein with the bandage and dressings until the next day. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned regarding the placement of styptic powders. Stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, be aware of this. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we have said.
It is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious when bleeding it, for beneath it is a nerve. If he goes too deep with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness will occur in it, which is difficult to heal, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision lengthwise with the lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes. For this vein, especially, it is necessary, if you want to bleed it, to bleed it by puncturing with the olive-shaped lancet or with the broad basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all the veins because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Except that you should, when performing phlebotomy, avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft area. It does no harm if you do not hit it on the first attempt to repeat the phlebotomy several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first attempt.
But this swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of phlebotomy, its complications, and what should be done beforehand in preparation for it, the first thing is that you should know that phlebotomy is either used to preserve health only.
Or it is used for illnesses.  The one used for preserving and maintaining health and preventing the occurrence of diseases should be phlebotomy in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, median cubital, and basilic veins, and the phlebotomy should be at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
And the phlebotomy should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the phlebotomy that is used for diseases, it has no specific time, but rather whenever the need and necessity for it arises, night or day.
And at any hour and at any time. Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.  So, if someone intends to be bled for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a lot of retained waste, lest foul superfluities be drawn from the intestines to the veins during the phlebotomy, harming the principal organs. And one should not bleed someone who is suffering from nausea, is drunk, or intoxicated until that has passed.
And one should also avoid phlebotomy immediately after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then consider thinning the humors before that if the blood is thick.
With foods and drinks and medicines, if possible. Then he should enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise to thin the blood, and perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have said, and he should aim to clear his mind that day of all bad psychological influences.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical influences such as excessive fatigue, exhaustion, and intercourse, and so on. And his session should be attended by things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant plants, amusements, and so on, each person according to their means.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the person being bled sits. Then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the bandage with the tie and twists it two or three times, and the tightening should be moderate.
Because when the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, the person being bled should rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then places his left index finger on the vein itself, below the place where he wants to bleed it slightly, so that the vein does not shift and he can avoid missing the target. لأنّ من العروق ما تجدها كالوتر يلوذ عند الفصد ومنها ما هى مملوءة ريحا فمتى وضعت المبضع عليها انخفضت تحت المبضع وخدعت الفاصد ولم يفتح المبضع العرق وإن فتحه فإنّما يكون فتحه ضيقا.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and deliberate in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet. If it opens the vein on that first attempt, then fine. Otherwise, he tries again a little below that spot or above it quickly, if the area has not swollen.
If the area swells or the patient becomes distressed, leave him for a day or two and do not tie the bandage, as it may bring on a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath. Then he resumes bleeding if he wishes. If the lancet pricked the vein and the opening was small and the blood flow was thin.
And if you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, return the lancet to the same hole, gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people the area swells with a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all, as it will not help you. Place some oil dregs on it, as this facilitates the flow of blood. It is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments.  And so on.
So use oil dregs in all your vein bleeding when blood flow is difficult.  Theriac al-Fārūq and saxifrage can also do this if either of them is placed on the area, as the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the bleeding site, which often happens, especially for those who have not been bled except that once, or if the opening of the vein was small, then hasten to place on the swelling a sponge dipped in slightly warmed water and salt and tie it for an hour, as it will dissolve.
And you should do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself completely, or from another vein. If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it will not harm. If you like, apply some dissolved aloe and myrrh.
Or some germander juice and the like. Often, swelling and flatulence occur when bleeding the basilic vein, so put your hand on it, and if you find it softens when you press on it, then that is bad flatulence, so beware of putting anything we have mentioned on it.
For arterial blood may flow from it, but bandage it with something astringent to harden the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. And it is necessary to remove from each person blood according to their strength and what appears from the dominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red, and likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away. And it is necessary for those who are full and strong and need to remove blood all at once.
to widen the opening of the vein and the lancet should be wide. And whoever is weak, the opposite of that, and it is necessary to remove it in stages, and the opening should be narrow. The best thing to use in phlebotomy is to be oblique, deviated, and incised, not punctured.
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from severing a nerve, and it is better and safer than transverse and longitudinal phlebotomy. And whoever habitually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to feed him, before phlebotomy, some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or oxymel.
If he has a hot temperament, let the blood be drawn in three or four stages. If he has a cold temperament, let him take, before phlebotomy, bread soaked in raisin wine or in honey syrup flavored with spices or in fragrant basil wine.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the exit of much blood, then he should be given meat broth and thin basil drink and apply rosewater perfume, rubbing his chest with it, and use all that we have mentioned in the section on fainting in the chapter on divisions.
which occurs from excessive bloodletting. As for whoever wants to refresh his arm and release his blood again, it is necessary for someone who has been bled excessively and whose strength is weak to release the blood little by little, according to his strength, on successive days.
As for whoever wants to refresh his arm and release his blood again and has a strong body, let him do that seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.  As for whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has flowed, it is necessary to refresh it for him on the second or third day.
As for someone whose body has an abundance of blood that has become hot and sharp and caused a fever, it is necessary to remove the blood all at once and remove a large amount and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. وأن تضع يدك على نبضه عند سيلان الدم لئلّا يحدث الموت مكان الغشى فكثيرا ما يعرض ذلك اذا جهل الفاصد ووقعت الغفلة، ولا ينبغى اذا أردت حلّ الذراع وتسريح الدم ثانية.
If the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood has become difficult, do not squeeze it hard or twist it forcefully, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you bleed it again or remove with the blade of the lancet what has congealed of the blood at the mouth of the vein.
Or apply to it some salt dissolved in water or apply to it some of the antidote *al-Fārūq* or *shakhzanaya,* and squeeze it gently until the blood comes out. If the vein has become swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity calls for releasing blood again and it is unavoidable, then either bleed it above that place or bleed it in the other arm or in the other vein.
As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the arm, it is bled instead of the median cubital and basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden because it is composed of them.  The manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly. Then tie above it with the bandage a slight, moderate tightening.
Then bleed the vein at a slight angle, neither transversely nor longitudinally, and let the opening be wide and your bleeding of it be a little above the wrist joint. If the exit of blood is difficult, put the hand back in the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer days, you may dispense with putting the hand back in the hot water.  Putting the hand in hot water to make the blood flow is mostly done in winter. Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins. لأن ليس تحته عرق ضارب ولا عصب، وأمّا فصد الأسيلم من اليد اليمنى فهو نافع من علل الكبد وكيفيّة فصده أن تشدّ معصم اليد بالرباط او بيدك بعد أن تدخله فى الماء الحارّ حتّى ينتفخ العرق.
Because there is no pulsating artery or nerve under it. As for the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  The way to bleed it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after placing it in hot water until the vein swells. ويتبيّن للحسّ جدّا ثم تفصده على تحريف قليلا وإن بترته بالكلّ لم يضرّه ذلك شيئا وتحفّظ لا تمعن يدك بالمبضع فإنّ تحته عصب الأصابع والموضع معرّى من اللحم، ثمّ تعيد اليد الى الماء الحارّ.
And leave it to let the blood flow into it. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and will be prevented from flowing. When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, put fat and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly.
And you should do the same with any narrow branch.  As for the benefit of its phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  And you do with its phlebotomy just as you did with the other, in the same way.  As for the saphenous phlebotomy, its benefit is for diseases that are in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.
And retention of menses and kidney diseases and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs and similar diseases. The way to phlebotomize it is to put his leg in hot water and massage it until the veins appear. Then tie above the ankle joint with a bandage, and the vein's location is at the heel, apparent towards the big toe.
And many branches spread from it on the surface of the leg, so phlebotomize it in its widest branch or at the heel where it converges, for that is best and safest.  If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the leg, beware of the nerves that are underneath it on the surface of the leg.
And make your incision for it obliquely as if you intend to sever it, and the lancet should be sharp. If the blood flow is difficult, let him put his leg back in the hot water and let the blood flow into it until it is finished. If the phlebotomist misses the vein with the lancet the first time,
let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the area is safe and there is no fear of a consequence if you are careful of the nerve, as we said. And you do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg, in the same manner. As for the sciatic vein, its location is, as we said, at the heel on the lateral side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain if that is due to hot blood. The way to phlebotomize it is to have the patient enter the bath and relax. Then tie his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage, for it will not appear except by this.
When it appears, phlebotomize it in whichever manner works for you: either obliquely, which is best, or sever it completely, or incise it. For its location is safe. It is, in most people, very hidden, so if you do not find it,
and it does not appear to the senses at all, then phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers. Be careful of the nerves, and let the desired amount of blood flow.
Then loosen the bandage and place cotton on the site of the phlebotomy and bind the area, for it will heal quickly.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and How to Use It.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping is done in two ways: one is cupping with scarification and letting out blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
This cupping without scarification is done in two ways.
And the cupping of the two akhda'ayn, which are the two sides of the neck, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, and the cupping of the two forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and the cupping of the two legs, and the cupping of the two ankles.
Cupping only draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason, it does not cause a drop in strength like phlebotomy.  Cupping, whether with fire or without fire, should not be used in any of the diseases that result from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If there is a need for cupping, due to illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time.
Some people, when they have an excess of blood to the point that they need to remove it by cupping, feel heaviness and headaches.  Some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others feel itching in their face and temples, darkness and burning in their eyes, and some itch at the site of their cupping.
Some laugh excessively. Some taste blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood. Others sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, the slain, wounds, and similar things in their sleep.  Whenever we see any of this...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping two or three hours after the start of the day. As for the benefit of wet cupping, it benefits heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But this should be after purging the whole body. This cupping may be a substitute for cephalic venesection.  One should beware of using it on someone with a cold brain or who has a cold, as it will greatly harm them.
Therefore, it should not be used on the elderly or those with cold ailments in their heads. Whoever becomes accustomed to it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass slightly downwards, for fear of causing forgetfulness. As for cupping the back, it is a substitute for venesection of the brachial and basilic veins.
Therefore, it is useful for asthma, shortness of breath, obstruction of the respiratory system, coughing, and fullness.  The cupping on the back should be raised a little because if it is placed too low, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping on the two jugular veins is beneficial for headaches, ophthalmia, migraines, sore throat, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It replaces venesection of the basilic vein.  You should instruct the cupper not to go too deep with the incision, lest he sever an artery and cause bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for thrush in the mouth, gum disease, and similar ailments in the mouth, and it can replace venesection of the vein in the lips. Cupping on the shoulders is useful for palpitations resulting from fullness and heat.
Cupping on the bellies of the two forearms is beneficial for the same things as venesection of the three veins: the basilic, the brachial and the cephalic, because it draws blood from all the thin veins in the flesh. These thin veins draw from other, thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
You should instruct the cupper not to make the incision too deep because the area is devoid of flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath.  As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and ulcers of the anus.
You should instruct the cupper to use a large cup made of copper, because the area requires strong suction, and a glass cup might break. He should make multiple incisions. Cupping on the legs noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body, it benefits chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, stimulates menstruation, helps with pimples and boils, and serves as an alternative to venesection of the saphenous and ankle veins. However, it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping the ankles has benefits similar to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cups is as follows: first, place the cup empty and apply moderate suction. Do not leave the cups on for long, but rather apply and remove them quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area. Continue repeating this process until you see the area has reddened and opened up.
And when the redness of the blood appears, then make an incision and reapply suction gently. Then consider the condition of the bodies. For those with thin flesh and open pores, you should only make one incision, lest the area ulcerate.
And instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to apply the suction gently with a gentle movement. If the blood is thick, he should make two incisions. The first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second time to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, he repeats the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a little blood, we are satisfied with one incision. If we want to extract a lot of blood, we make more incisions, and if we estimate that the blood is thick.
then it is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit for the incision is the depth of the skin only.  What oils and waters should be used when applying cups, and what the person being cupped should avoid.  As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are narrow,
it is necessary to anoint the places of the cups with opening, softening, resolving oils. If it is summertime, then use oils such as oil of roses, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds.
If it is in the winter, then use oils such as oil of narcissus, or oil of iris, or oil of chamomile, or lily, and the like. If the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be oil of marjoram, or oil of pennyroyal, or oil of rue, or oil of dill, and the like.
If the person being cupped has wide pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary to abstain from oil. These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water or cold water or nightshade water or pumpkin water or purslane water and the like. As for someone whose blood has much moisture,
they should wash their cupping sites with vinegar or with myrtle and sumac water and the like.  As for those whose excesses are thick, they should wash their cupping sites with old wine or with marjoram water or a decoction of dill or chamomile and the like.  It is necessary to avoid cupping in the bath and immediately after the bath.
Rather, it should be employed an hour or two after leaving the bath.  No one should sleep after cupping. How the person being cupped or bled should be managed before cupping and after it.
You must first observe.  If the person being cupped or bled is choleric and his blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things such as pomegranates and chicory with vinegar, and lettuce, and oxymel, and julep and the like. And he should make his foods baby chickens and lamb, vinegar-based stews, and dishes with sour grapes, and the like.
Whoever has a cold temperament should be given honeyed drinks and a drink of grape syrup or oxymel with seeds, and should consume fragrant, medium-aged wine that is between old and new. He should be instructed to eat little food, and his food should be baby chickens, partridges, small birds, and young pigeons in white stews. The drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food.
It may be necessary at times to give some people some of the antidote al-Fārūq or musk medicine or theriac before cupping and before bleeding or after it to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those with fevers.
As for the cups that are applied without scarification, they are the cups that are placed on the liver and spleen and breasts, and on the abdomen and navel and the location of the kidneys and the hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate scarification on them.  Rather, the purpose of them is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Like when we place the cup on the breasts in the case of nosebleed, or we use it to dissolve cold wind that has become trapped in the organ, like placing the cup on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ and warms it and removes the pain by dissolving that wind.
It may also be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone in them, so by the strength of its suction, it may open the blockage or remove the stone from its place.  And it does likewise when placed on the liver and spleen when wind is trapped in them. These cups may be used empty, by suction only.
They may be used with fire, and they may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of hemorrhoids, and that is that you fill the cupping glass – and let it be large – with hot water alone, or with water in which some of the herbs suitable for that have been cooked.
Then it is placed full on the area, and held and removed and repeated several times as needed. And this is the image of the cupping glass that is used with fire.
The width of its mouth is two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth is about half a span, and there is on its side, about halfway down, a small hole about the size of a needle. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
It is smooth, level and polished so that it does not harm the organ when placed on it, and there is in its center a transverse rod of copper or iron where the candle is placed with fire.  And this cupping glass may be made larger than what we have described, and smaller, according to the ailments.
Its use is established. Indeed, the cupping glasses for boys and thin people are not the same as the cupping glasses for men and thick-bodied people. As for how to place this cupping glass with fire on the organ, it is that you prepare a wick with fire from well-twisted flax or a small candle of tar, and you place it on the center of the fixed rod that is in the center of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire upwards is towards the bottom of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body does not burn.  Then it is placed on the organ, and the finger is on the hole that we mentioned, so that if we hold the cupping glass as long as we need, we remove the finger.
And the vapor comes out through that hole and the cupping glass loosens on the spot. Then you prepare the wick in the manner described and repeat it if you need to. As for the cupping glass that is used in the treatment of erysipelas with water, it has neither a fixed rod nor a hole.
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only.  And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold a lot of water, the better.
Chapter Ninety-Seven
On Applying Leeches
Leeches are only used in most cases on organs where cupping glasses cannot be placed, either because of their small size, such as the lip and gums and the like, or because the organ is devoid of flesh, such as the finger, nose and the like.
The way to use them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bellies. ثمّ يستفرغ البدن أوّلا بالفصد او بالحجامة ثمّ يمسح العضو العليل.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it, and when it is full it falls off.  If it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage it and squeeze it.  If the flow of blood continues after the leech falls off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
And place it on top until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of fava beans on the area.
And leave it until the fava beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop. And if there is a need to reapply leeches, do not reapply those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for when they sense some blood they will stick to the spot. When you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will immediately fall off.
Chapter Three.
On Bone-Setting.
This chapter is also among the most essential things needed in the practice of medicine, and it is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is also claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a word of it.
For this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country, and I have never met anyone at all who is proficient in it. وإنّما استفدت منه ما استفدت لطول قراءتى لكتب الأوائل وحرصى على فهمها حتّى استخرجت علم ذلك منها، ثمّ لزمت التجربة والدربة طول عمرى.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. ومضت عليه تجربتى بعد أن قرّبته لكم وخلّصته من شعب التطويل واختصرته غاية الاختصار وبيّنته غاية البيان وصوّرت لكم فيه صورا كثيرة من صور الآلات التى تستعمل فيه.
As it increases clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.  And there is no power except in God, the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
In it are comprehensive and summarized points regarding bone fractures that should be presented. And before we begin mentioning the fractured and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter comprehensive statements and sections. تضطرّكم أوّلا الى فهمها والوقوف على حقيقتها أنتم ومن كان حريصا لتعلّم هذه الصناعة الشريفة غيركم.
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, blow, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to phlebotomize him, or give him a purgative, or both. إن لم يمنع من ذلك مانع مثل ضعف القوّة او كان الذى حدث به شىء من ذلك صبيّا او شيخا هرما او كان الزمان شديد الحرّ او شديد البرد جدّا.
Then his diet should be restricted to cold vegetables, the meat of birds and kids, and he should be prevented from drink, rich meats, filling up on food, and any food that fills the veins with blood until the swelling is relieved and you are not expecting a discharge to the site.
Then, at that time, let the patient return to his former regimen, which was his habit. So if the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient nourish himself with very nourishing, rich, and firm foods that have a viscous quality, such as porridges, rice, heads, trotters, and cow stomachs. والبيض والسمك الطرىّ والشراب الغليظ ونحو ذلك فإنّه بهذا التدبير يكون انعقاد الكسر أسرع وأجود، واعلم أنّ العظام المكسورة اذا كانت فى الرجال المشتدّين والشيوخ فليس يمكن أن تتّصل وتلتحم على طبيعتها الأولى أبدا.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones. And bones that are extremely soft, such as the bones of young children, may join and heal. But nature grows on the broken bone, from all its sides, something resembling thick glue that adheres to it and binds it until some of it sticks to the others.
And it binds some of it to others until it reaches the utmost strength and firmness as it was originally, so that nothing hinders it from its functions.
For this reason, it is necessary that the patient's food be foods that have firmness, viscosity, and richness, as we have said. And know that the types of fractures vary according to the differences in the organs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so are all the other organs, each one different from the other. And we will mention each type of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed separately. And the type of bone fracture may also differ in itself.
Because it may be fractured into pieces without splinters occurring in it, and it may be fractured along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have splinters and protrusions, separated and not separated, and the fracture may be with a wound and a tear in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And each type has a specific method for its repair, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a bone fracture is recognized are its curvature, its swelling, its perceptible appearance, and its crackling when you press it with your hand.
So when there is no apparent curvature in the area, no crackling, and you do not feel any disturbance when you examine the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a bruise or a minor fracture or a slight crack. So you should not move it by stretching and pressing at all.
Rather, apply to it the medications that will be mentioned later, which are appropriate for the location, then bandage it gently.  And know that when the bone is broken and shattered in two without any splinters occurring in it, each part has become separated from the other.
Therefore, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that repairing and aligning it is easier than a bone in which splinters have occurred. Then bandage it as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand. And place the limb on a level surface in its natural form, so that when the broken bone fragments are stretched, then you should return those protrusions to their places by any means you can with skill and gentleness.
Strive as much as possible not to cause the patient any pain or discomfort with your actions.  Strive to join one bone to the other in the best possible manner.  And at that time, you should touch and probe them with your hand.  If you find anything amiss, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive pulling and forceful squeezing, as many ignorant people do.  They often cause, by their actions, hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their practice.
Then, after alignment, precision, and bandaging, ensure that the limb is kept still and at rest. Warn the patient against moving it while awake or asleep, when turning or moving around, when defecating, and in all movements as much as possible. They should ensure the limb is positioned in a way that avoids pain.
Whenever they feel pain or discomfort in a particular position, they should change it to one that is painless, while ensuring that this new position is level and straight.
This prevents crookedness in the limb when it heals.  As for the method of bandaging the fractured limb, it is as I will describe to you. Know that fractured limbs differ in size, thickness, and form.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar bones...
...should be wrapped with thin, soft bandages. Those that are thick, such as the thigh, back, and chest, should be wrapped with wide, firm bandages, because a wide bandage holds the large limb and tightens it evenly from all sides, leaving no irregularities.
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate medication. فى مشاقة ليّنة على موضع الكسر ثمّ تبدأ بلفّ الرباط على موضع الكسر نفسه ثلاث لفّات او أربع على حسب ما يستحقّ العضو وتشدّ يدك قليلا بالرباط ثمّ تذهب به الى الناحية العليا من موضع الكسر.
with less tension than you applied to the fractured site. Then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and gradually loosen the tension until you reach a suitable portion of the healthy area.  Then take another bandage and wrap it also over the fracture site.
Wrap it a few times, then bring the wrapping to the area below the fracture. Your action in tightening and loosening the wrap should be as described for the first, upper wrapping. Then place soft lint or rags between the wrappings to even out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything there. Then wrap another bandage over it.  Then apply your well-constructed splints over these bandages immediately if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something that soothes the swelling and removes the inflammation, and leave it for a few days, then apply the splints.  The splints should be made of wide, carved, and skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or the splints can be made from sieve wood.
which are made of pine or palm leaf ribs or heather or Ferula and the like, whatever is available.  The width of each splint should be like this image and this exact shape.
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the fractured limb, whether large or small. Image of the splint:
Then tighten another bandage over the splints, just like your first tightening, then tie it from above with tight threads as we mentioned regarding tightening, which is that your tightening should be more at the site of the fracture. وكلّما بعد عن الكسر كان الشدّ أقلّ.
The threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and specifically made of damp linen, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen ignorant people do, making their threads from twisted strips of linen, this is a grave mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the desired tightening with them. There should not be less than a finger's width between one splint and another.
If the patient is bothered by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then place soft rags or fluffed wool underneath them so that they do not cause any harm. As for when the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it until after five days, or seven, or more, depending on your confidence regarding the occurrence of hot swelling.
This is the description of the bandages that the ancients used to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is a description of a general, simplified bandage that treats fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
It is that you take mill dust, which is the fine flour that clings to the walls of the millstone when the mill is operating, and knead it, as is, without sifting, with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then spread it.
The description of another bandage that treats fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mastich, labdanum, acacia, frankincense, storax, and gum Arabic; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; twenty dirhams of tamarisk; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Greek clay. يدقّ الجميع ويخلط بماء الأثل او ببياض البيض إن كان مزاج العليل محرورا ثمّ يستعمل هذا الضماد فإنّه حسن التأليف يجبر العظام المكسورة سريعا ويصلح لأكثر الناس لاعتداله.
The description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains:  Take ten dirhams each of storax, mastic, and white marshmallow; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; six dirhams of acacia; twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, then use it.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their positions, and it relieves the pain that affects them, and for bone fissures and fractures: Take degreased wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.  This bandage does not have the strength to set bones.
But it is excellent in relieving hot swelling and particularly in repelling pain.  The description of another bandage that sets broken bones:  Take leaves of the mute fig and leaves of wild poppy, grind them together, and apply them moist as a bandage.  The description of another abbreviated bandage used when a bone fracture has set.
And you want to resolve the remaining swelling: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and fenugreek flour. Grind everything and knead it with honey if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or plain water, and use it.
The description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than this first one, used when a hard swelling occurs when a bone has set: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile.
Grind everything and knead it with salt water or fresh water or honey, all depending on the heat of the limb and the subsiding of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else.  And he described that it should be of medium consistency, between thick and thin.  As for Galen, he considered that things with drying properties and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and things like those we mentioned, should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.
The description of a bandage useful for weakness and pain: Take equal parts of litharge, chickpeas, chopped human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt. Grind, sift, knead, and bandage with it.  As for the amount of time the bandage should remain...
Then it is loosened. Thus, observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the patient, do not loosen it for many days. If, however, intense itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area...
Then quickly loosen it immediately, and do not delay this at all. Remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply teased wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bandage it on overnight, until you prevent hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain disappears. Then return it to gentle tightening and light bandaging. Do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And be gentle with it until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms are completely gone, and you need bandaging and tightening, then replace it as you did the first time, in the same manner. If none of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb...
...do not loosen it except after three or four or five or seven days. It may be left for twenty days.  All of this depends on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture sets and the flesh around it is nearly healed.
Then, at that time, increase the tightening more than your initial tightening, and also increase the richness of the patient's diet, as mentioned previously. If you see that the fracture site has dried and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
So, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and slightly loosen the tightening. For by this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly. As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, breaking the limb again...
...because it did not set properly the first time and healed crookedly, this is a mistake in their practice and a great deception. Had it been correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of it among them whatsoever. والصواب أن لا يعمل به،.
Chapter Two.
On fractures occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are varied, and their causes are diverse. Among fractures, some are caused by a sword blow, which may either shave off the entire bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone... كما يفعل القدوم فى الخشب.
This type of fracture is therefore called adze-like.  Or, the sword stroke may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface, without penetrating through it completely; this type of fracture is called a simple avulsion. The wound of these two types of fractures can be either large or small.
And among fractures, there are those that are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow from a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these two types of fractures can also be either large or small.  And among fractures are those that are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair; this is a minor fissure.
This type of fracture is therefore called hair-like. And there are fractures that result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, which pushes part of the bone inward, creating a depression, just as happens to a copper pot when struck—a part of it is pushed inward.
This occurs most often in heads with soft bone, such as the heads of children.  All these types of fractures may have loose fragments or fragments that are not loose; we will discuss the treatment of all of these in their proper place. We recognize all of these types of fractures by examining them.
And by probing them and removing the corrupted flesh from them.  As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink to it; the fracture will then appear black.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms clearly indicating danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter,
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted, causing the symptoms we described to appear.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is shattering and bruising, you should cut away the shattered, bruised part as I will describe to you.  This involves shaving the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as appropriate.
This is done by packing the area with rags soaked in rose syrup and oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then proceed to trepan the bone and extract it, which can be done in one of two ways.
One way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw, and this is its picture:
Then use another saw after this one, a little wider, and this is its picture:
Then also use another saw, wider than the second.  You should have a set of various saws, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp. Let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use gentle strokes on the saw so as not to shake the head and cause harm.  If the bone is strong and hard, it should be perforated around it with drills, which they call non-penetrating drills, before using the saws.  They are called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not go beyond the skull bone to what is behind it, since the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, which prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip, in length and shortness, corresponds to the thickness of that skull. This is a picture of three types. من المثاقب كبير ومتوسّط وصغير:.
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another place, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of the probe or similar.
Then you cut with the cutters between every two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with some other of the instruments that have been prepared for that.
Such as forceps and delicate hooks.  You should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the meninges. When you have hollowed out the bone and cleared it from the meninges, if it was adhering to it, and removed it, you should scrape.
And smooth the roughness of what remains on the bone with another instrument resembling the cutter, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If any small bones and fragments remain, you take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other way of operating, it is certainly an easy way, far from danger, Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said. ينبغى لك أوّلا أن تبدأ بكشف جزء العظم من الموضع الذى الكسر فيه أشدّ وأشهر حتّى اذا كشفت ذلك الجزء صيّرت تحته طرف هذا المقطع العدسىّ وهذه صورته:.
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it should be on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the meninges and the sharp face of the cutter is on the bone, then you strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no fearful accident will occur at all, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places on the bone, scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular cutter itself and remove it gently, for it will be removed without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane and what has broken from the bone is its surface and there remains in it roughness and fine splinters, then you should smooth out that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps which you have made in several different sizes so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one for each location depending on what the work leads you to.
and the fractured bone itself and its shape, and you should use for your smoothing, first, the widest of those rasps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do so in succession until you come to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and fine fractures, it is necessary to apply a treatment to each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. وتغمسها فى شراب ودهن ورد وتضعها على الخرقة الأولى وتصنع ذلك بأخفّ ما تقدر عليه لئلّا تثقل الصفاق ثمّ تستعمل من فوق رباطا عريضا ولا تشدّه إلّا بقدر ما يمسك الجرح فقط.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from hot swelling, then loosen it and use after that the medications that have an excess of dryness, such as orris root, and thistle flour, and frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is that you make a powder from these medications.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use in that a medication that cleanses and does not sting, and take great care while treating the wound that it be clean, free from the harm of oil and dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and this causes a great affliction to the patient, and it may happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected.
Blackness on its surface, consider. If the symptoms that we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed. However, if the blackness only occurred from a medication placed on it, and the strength of that medication was such that it caused that blackness.
Then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the repair of the nose if it is broken.
Know that nothing of the nose is broken except its two upper bones together or one of them, because they are bone, because what is below it is cartilaginous and is not broken, but it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.
If one of its two bones is broken, it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape, and let this be done gently and carefully so that no pain is caused to the patient by your action.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to repair it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the wicks be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not see that; rather, the wicks should be moistened with egg white kneaded with mill dust.
Then leave the wicks until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is hardened.  You can also insert goose feather tubes into the nose in place of the wicks, after wrapping soft rags around them, so that their retention of the nasal fracture is stronger and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
This is not necessary; if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.  If a hot swelling appears on the nose during your work, dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.
If a hot swelling does not appear, you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and fine frankincense kneaded with egg white, then place a soft compress on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all, if the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces.
Or if they are fragmented, then you should incise over them and extract them with the appropriate instrument, then sew the incision and treat it with what heals and closes it from the appropriate ointments.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes. حتّى يبرأ.
Chapter Four.
On the reduction of the lower jaw if it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not with a wound, observe: if its fracture is only from the outside and it is not fractured in two and is depressed inwards, then recognizing it is easy.
It is appropriate that if the fracture is in the right fissure, you insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and likewise, if the fracture is in the left fissure, you insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the hump of the fracture from inside to outside.
With your other hand from outside the bone, you control its straightening. If the fracture of the jaw is broken in two, it is appropriate to apply extension from both sides in a straight line until you can straighten it. If chattering has occurred in the teeth.
Or they separate, then tie those you hope will remain with a gold or silver thread or silk. Then place the qayruti on the broken jaw, then place a folded rag on it, and place on the rag a large, well-fitted splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. ثمّ تربطه من فوق على حسب ما يتهيّأ لك ربطه ويوافق ضمّه حتّى لا ينتقض وتأمر العليل بالتودّع والسكون وتجعل غذاءه الأحساء الليّنة، فإن ظننت أنّه قد تغيّر شىء من الشكل بوجه من الوجوه فبادر بحلّه فى اليوم الثالث.
Then tie it from above according to what you can tie and what is appropriate to join it so that it does not become dislodged. And you instruct the patient to be gentle and still, and make his food soft broths. If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hasten to loosen it on the third day. ثمّ تصلح ما تضمّده بغبار الرحى مع بياض البيض او بدقيق السميد بعد نزعك القيروطى عنه وتضع على الضماد مشاقة ليّنة، فما دام يلصق ذلك الضماد عليه ولم يتغيّر للعظم حال فاتركه.
Do not loosen it until it heals and the fracture strengthens. Often this fracture strengthens in three weeks. If during that time a hot swelling appears, use what we have repeatedly mentioned in soothing it until that swelling disappears.
And if the fracture is with a wound, observe. If a fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those fragments with whatever instrument is appropriate for extracting them. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel as much as you need.
Then when you have extracted those fragments, and nothing remains of them, stitch the edges of the wound if it is wide, otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for it. وتلحم الجرح حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of the clavicle when it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest type to treat;
or fragments occur at the fracture, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants, one of whom steadies the upper arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other extends the neck toward the opposite side.
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any protrusion or indentation. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The bone should be the size you need. Extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.  If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, the patient should lie on his back.
A medium-sized pillow should be placed under his shoulder and the assistant should press his shoulder down so that the clavicle bone, which is deep, rises up. Then repair the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should make an incision over it and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be ingenious in cutting it with one of the cutters that I have prepared for that purpose. بعد أن تصير تحت الترقوة الآلة التى تحفظ الصفاق وهى آلة من خشب او من حديد وهذه صورتها:.
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, and its width is according to what you need for the size of the bone, large or small.  As for its length, it is also according to what enables you to work. And let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the laceration of the wound that you made when extracting the bone fragment is wide and you are safe from a hot swelling, join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the laceration is small or you fear a hot swelling, then pack the wound with lint and bandages according to the extent of the wound opening.
If a hot swelling develops, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it to the swelling. As for splinting the bone when it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply to the bone a dressing made from mill dust with egg white. وتضع المشاقة الليّنة عليه ثمّ تضع الكرة تحت إبطه إن احتاج الى ذلك ثمّ تأخذ عمامة تكون طويلة جدّا ويكون عرضها شبرا او نحو ذلك ثمّ احمل رفادة مثنيّة على المشاقة والضماد ثمّ خذ جبيرة من لوح رقيق.
And the main concern is that the splint does not move from the fractured bone. ولذلك ينبغى أن تتفقّد العليل فى كلّ يوم فكلّما استرخى الرباط ورأيت الجبيرة قد زالت فأصلح ذلك وشدّ الرباط، ثمّ اجعل نوم العليل على ظهره واجعل تحت إبطه عند نومه بالليل مخدّة صغيرة.
So that his arm is raised from his side, thus the fractured clavicle is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage unless something happens in the area, such as itching or swelling, for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason to. وردّ فى الشدّ واتركه حتّى ينجبر ويتعقّد كسر الترقوة، ويشتدّ ويقوى أكثر ذلك فى ثمانية وعشرين يوما.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder. The shoulder rarely breaks in its wide part, but rather its edges break. So, whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, and that is known by touch, then reduce it according to the shape of the fracture.
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaq, and place over it padding made of folded cloth, then place on it a wide splint made of wood.
Thin, according to the size of the entire shoulder, or slightly wider. If there is a curvature under the splint in any of the areas of the shoulder, then straighten that curvature with soft mashaq until the splint sits flat, then tie it from above with a long turban.
Tie it tightly and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.  Let the patient lie on his healthy side, and the shoulder heals in twenty days.
Days or twenty-five days. When this period is completed, loosen the bandage and you are safe, for it is one of the bones that one does not fear will shatter or break. If a splinter protrudes from the bone and it pricks under the skin, then cut over it and extract it. واصنع ما ذكرته فى كسر الترقوة من تسكين الورم الحارّ إن حدث شىء من ذلك،.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of a fractured sternum.
The sternum may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, it inclines downwards, and severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing occur.
And perhaps he coughs up blood, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from feeling. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, with a pillow placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are brought together by hands from both sides, gently straightening it in every possible way.
And continue until the shape of the bone returns as it should be, then apply the bandage and the dressing, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather or similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth. ثمّ تلطّف فى ربطها على العظم المكسور لئلّا تزول، ومرّ بالرباط على استدارة الى الظهر مرّات وشدّه شدّا محكما، ثمّ تفقّد الرباط فى كلّ وقت، وكلّما استرخى شددته.
And if it becomes necessary to untie it due to itching, pain, or swelling that occurs in the area, then quickly untie it and remove the dressing and treat what has occurred with its appropriate treatment, then replace the dressing if you see fit. وجها وألزمه الشدّ حتّى يبرأ،.
Chapter Eight.
On the reduction of ribs when fractured. Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick areas near the back, while their front ends are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and knowing this is not hidden from the senses when examining with the fingers.
Their reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in a secure manner until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and splint the broken bone if needed. If the rib fracture is angled inward, it causes severe pain to the patient.
And a pricking like the pricking that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the diaphragm, and also causes him difficulty breathing, coughing, and expulsion of much blood, and this is difficult to treat. The ancients devised many tricks for it.
Some of them said that the patient's food should be such as generates flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands, and the fracture is pushed outward. We dislike this, lest it be a confirmation of the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred, and if it has occurred, it increases and confirms it.
Some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on the area and then sucked strongly, which is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract excess to the area because of its weakness.  Some of them said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.
And padding is placed between the ribs until they are filled, so that the bandaging is even when you wrap it around the circumference. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of pleurisy, with regard to food and medicine. If the patient is afflicted with a severe matter that he cannot bear… وكان العظم ينخس الحجاب نخسا مؤذيا وتخوّفنا على العليل فينبغى أن نشقّ على الموضع ونكشف عن الضلع المكسور ثمّ نصير تحته الآلة التى تحفظ الصفاق التى تقدّم وصفها ونقطع العظم برفق ونخرجه.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs during that time, then quickly soak compresses in rose oil and place them on the area, and also treat the patient internally with that which soothes the swelling.
And he lies on the side that makes sleep easier for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the repair of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs in them - and this rarely happens to them, what happens most often is a contusion - and likewise also the vertebrae of the back, so if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. فانظر فإن رأيت يديه قد استرختا وخدرتا وماتتا ولم يقدر على حركتهما ولا بسطهما ولا قبضهما وإذا قرصتهما او نخستهما بإبرة لم يحسّ بذلك ولم يجد فيهما ألما فاعلم أنه لا يبرأ فى أكثر الأحوال فهو هالك.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the spinal cord is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back suffer the same, and you want to know whether he will recover or not.
Then look at his legs. If you see that they have become limp, and what happened to the hands has happened to them, and then, if he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, وإذا استلقى على ظهره وأراد البول لم يستطع على ذلك فاعلم أنّه هالك فلا تعنى بعلاجه فإن لم يعرض له شىء من ذلك كان الأمر أخفّ، وعلاج ما حدث من ذلك أن تروم تسكين الورم الحارّ.
By placing on the bruised vertebra rose oil alone or with roasted egg whites. Apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the area one of the strengthening, drying dressings and bandage it tightly. Order him to rest and remain still.
And he should not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something has occurred in the bone at the time of the injury, from which he has recovered, then it is necessary to incise the skin over it and extract that bone. ثمّ تجمع شفتى الجرح إن كان كبيرا بالخياطة ثمّ تعالج بالمراهم الملحمة حتّى يبرأ، فإن انكسر آخر عظم العصعص وهو عجز الذنب فينبغى أن تدخل الإبهام من اليد اليسرى فى المقعدة.
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and straightening is achieved. Then apply a dressing and a splint if needed, then tighten it.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, then incise over it and extract it, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the reduction of hip fracture.
Hip bones rarely break. If they do break, the break is usually a fragmentation at the ends and a longitudinal split, and it tilts inward. The patient experiences pain in the area, throbbing, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its reduction is by passing your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then reduce that fracture as best you can until its shape resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can reduce that fracture. Once you have reduced it, apply the dressing, then place a splint of wood or leather on it and bandage it tightly.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the splint. Level the hollows at the flanks with whatever fills them so that the bandaging is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If a hot swelling appears...
stop extending it and reducing it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will soothe it as described previously, then return to its reduction and bandage it as appropriate.  If fragments appear in the bone, or something crumbles from its ends, it should not be removed.
It should not be touched, but leveled from the outside, as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the reduction of a fractured humerus.
The humerus is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it is fractured, reduce it in one of two ways. One of these is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this image:.
And tie two straps to its ends, then suspend it from a high place. Have the patient sit on a chair, then place his broken arm on the stick so that his armpit is affixed to the middle of the curve of the stick. Then suspend something heavy above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with both his hands until the fracture is returned to how it should be. The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck by a strap.
Then you order two assistants, one of them to stabilize what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to stabilize below it, and each of them extends it in his direction. And if you want the extension to be stronger, tie a strap below the fracture and a strap above it, and each of the assistants extends them in their direction.
If the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then the middle of the strap should be under the armpit and the other below the fracture towards the elbow. Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary for the strap to be placed at that location and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently, without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and joined well. Then bind it if no hot swelling appears. But if a hot swelling appears, leave the binding until the seventh day and put on it oiled wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
So when the swelling subsides, then bind it. The method of binding is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a roll of new cloth over the dressing, then bring the forearm onto the upper arm itself, and place his hand, open, on his shoulder.
And apply the cloth and the binding on the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as the splints, if there is no obstacle preventing you from doing so and nothing has shifted in the broken bone. If you fear that something will shift, then use splints.
That is, you place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than all the other splints, and let there be a finger's width between each splint. And let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, extending three fingers beyond it on each side.
Then you bind the splints with the binding mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
That is, your binding should be tighter at the site of the fracture.
And the farther from the fracture, the looser the binding. If you find that applying the splints and binding, as we have said, at the time of your setting the limb from the first hour is suitable, then do so.
And if you fear hot swelling, leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we have said. Then inspect the bandage every three days, lest itching or swelling occur in the area, or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, and correct all of that as we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of this will occur, do not loosen the bandage except after many days. The patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a cushion filled with wool should be placed moderately under the upper arm.
And check at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the fractured limb be distorted or the bandage loosened, and correct all of that with your best effort. And make the patient's diet according to the order we presented, that the food be light at first, until the bone begins to strengthen.
Then you should increase his food. For it is usual for the upper arm and leg to strengthen in forty days. Then it should be unbound, and he should use the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.  If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
do not remove the bandage from it until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the reduction of a fracture of the forearm.
The forearm is composed of two bones, called the two ulnas. One of them is small, and it is the one next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is placed under the small one from below. Sometimes the larger ulna breaks alone, or the small one alone, and sometimes they break together.
Whenever the small, upper ulna is broken, its reduction is easy and its healing is faster. When the lower ulna breaks, its fracture is bad and its healing difficult.  And the worst is when the two bones break together. If the bone that is broken is the small, upper ulna.
The physician, when reducing it, should make the extension gentle and easy until he sets it. If it is the large ulna that is broken, he should make the extension stronger, and if both ulnas are broken, he should make the extension much stronger.
The form of the hand during reduction and extension should be placed extended on a pillow, with the thumb of the hand upwards, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient sitting cross-legged.
And let the pillow be opposite him in height so that the patient is not strained by hardship.
Then an assistant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extends it from above likewise. Then the physician sets the bone until he reduces it in the best possible shape. If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then…
Reduce each fragment to its place with your best effort. If a separated fragment appears in it and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of reducing it, then incise over it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously. If the fracture is with a wound, I have devoted a chapter to it.
So take the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your reduction, then apply a cloth soaked in cerate made with rose oil and white wax. Let it be medium between thick and thin, and tie the cloth over it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the cerate and apply the prepared dressing of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger. Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture is in one ulna or in both ulnae together, then make your bandaging on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter.  And as you rotate the bandaging upwards or downwards, make the bandaging a little looser, as mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
Let the cloths that are wrapped on the fracture be soft and moist cloths, and do not let them be very hard. And let the thread with which it is tied be specifically linen, medium between thin and thick, as we described. And check the limb and the bandaging after [a few] days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itch that occurs in the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until the itch subsides, and the limb should be left unbandaged for a night so that it can rest, then the bandaging should be resumed.
If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or something similar, then correct all of that to the best of your ability.  And also observe, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then you should loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
If none of what we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be unbandaged until after twenty days or so. Then hang the patient's hand around his neck, and let his arm be straight, and he should carefully avoid sudden movements, and let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days. All of that is according to the states of the humors and the states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of fractures of the hand and fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely occur, but contusions frequently do. So, whenever a fracture or contusion happens to the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him.
Then he places his hand on it, extended. Then an assistant extends the broken bones and the physician sets them until they are well aligned.  Then the bandage and the splint should be applied if a hot swelling does not occur. Then a splint is applied over the area, according to the location.
I inserted it into a soft cloth. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape from a cloth and order the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand. Then it is bandaged with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather so that the leather conforms to the curvature of the entire hand, and you bandage it as needed. If the fracture is outwards, then you should place a splint on top and another splint underneath in the palm so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the bandaging is carried as the hand turns, and it is interlocked between the fingers with the bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as needed, then bandaged with the hand.  And if you wish, make a small, straight splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, straighten them and bandage them with the adjacent healthy finger, or bandage them all together in sequence, which is better, or place a small, straight splint on them.
As we said regarding the thumb, monitor during and after your reduction for hot swelling. Address it as needed whenever something like this occurs, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the reduction of a fractured femur.
The femur is frequently fractured and is perceptible to the senses because it rotates forward and backward. Its reduction is achieved by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, with the patient lying on his face.
Then, an assistant pulls each bandage in its respective direction evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  But if it is close to the origin of the femur, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be tightened.
[It should be placed] at the origin of the femur towards the pubis so that the pull is upwards, and the other bandage [should be placed] below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so that the pull is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form.
The bone will unite well. Then it is necessary to apply the dressing and tightening, unless a hot swelling occurs in the limb. If swelling occurs in it, leave it for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for tightening it, a strong, wide turban should be wound around the fracture two or three times, leaving any excess. Then the leg should be bent until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread on top from both sides.
Then wind the remaining part of the turban around the leg and thigh. Then place the splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one of them on the leg bone. Then fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin the strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site with three or four turns.  The further the bandage is from the fracture site, the less, gentler, and looser the tightening should be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie the adjacent splints from above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the ankle, then tighten the ends of the splints on the other side with them as well.
So that the bandage does not shift from its place, leave the tightening in place as long as the limb does not experience burning, swelling, inflammation or anything similar. If any of this occurs, immediately loosen it and correct what has happened, as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a bone fragment that pierces, you should straighten it if possible. Otherwise, incise over it and extract it and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the femur can also be tightened without the leg being joined to it with splints.
As we mentioned regarding the humerus and forearm, except that splinting it in this manner does not cause the patient to limp. But if you splint it alone without joining the leg to it, its owner will inevitably limp permanently.
Know that the femur tightens in fifty days, more or less, all depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Fracture of the Kneecap.
The kneecap rarely experiences a fracture, but it may often suffer a contusion. If it does experience a fracture, it will be either a fissure or fragmentation into pieces.  This may occur with or without a wound.
You determine all of this by touch, and treat it by aligning any separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and matched as well as alignment, gentleness, and skill allow. Then apply the bandage and, if necessary, a rounded splint over it.
Apply appropriate bandaging over it. Then attend to all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by addressing each symptom appropriately until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the Treatment of Leg Fractures.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the two bones of the arm. ولذلك صار جبره كجبر الذراع سواء والعمل واحد، فإن انكسر العظمان جميعا انقلبت الساق الى جميع الجهات، وإن انكسر العظم الأرقّ انقلبت الساق الى قدّام وإن انكسر العظم الأغلظ وحدث ذلك من أسفل فهو ممّا لا يخفى عليك.
So use extension and alignment, and apply splints accordingly in the same manner, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and you should be very gentle in treating it.
There is one additional procedure for the leg compared to the arm: when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing the ceilings which are placed between the cracks in the boards, or they can be made of palm leaf ribs or similar material.
Choose those that have a little thickness and are not too thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap a cloth around each one twice lengthwise and place one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the outer side.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two strips together in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. By this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and is well supported.  A wooden trough along the length of the leg may also be used.
The leg is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary if the fracture is accompanied by a wound. Then check the leg every day and take great care of it regarding swelling, inflammation, or any other such issue. فمتى حدث شىء من ذلك فقابله بما ينبغى الى أن يبرأ، وعظم الساق ينجبر فى ثلاثين يوما او نحوها،.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the foot, they may be fractured, and the toes also are rarely fractured, but rather are subject to contusion in most cases.
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see that those bones are overlapping, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then tread on it and straighten it.
Until they return to their places, then apply the dressing and the splint from above, and place a small board under the sole of the foot that has two flat ends, then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with bandages and everything else you need.
When three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage, and you will find the bones straightened whether they were fractured or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you regarding setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken toe the length of the toe and slightly wider than it, then place this board I described to you under the foot and tighten it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are broken,
then put a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a soft cloth, and tighten the board on the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you regarding all the other fractures, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and address each symptom as appropriate.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the Fracture of the Woman's Vulva, the Pubic Bone, and the Man's Penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit cross-legged, then lean her back little by little, and have her held from behind. Then the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her back is raised little by little, so that the cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the broken bone is returned to its place. Then a pad is placed on her back, and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is removed gently so she can urinate.
It is returned in the way it was first inserted, then she returns to her original padding. This is done for seven days or so, and it will heal.  And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a reed tube to its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will return to place. Then pack it with cotton and continue as we have described for several days until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone is fractured in a man or woman, the following is used in its repair.
Its reduction and alignment are as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure in these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, will not be hidden from you, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book of mine well, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
on the correct way to reduce and bind it, so understand. As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take the trachea of a goose, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it, and bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the Reduction of Bone Fractures When Accompanied by a Wound.
It is advisable for anyone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, that you immediately perform phlebotomy (blood letting) if the conditions for phlebotomy are favorable, as we have explained previously.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available, then proceed to reduce the fracture on that same day and do not delay.
If a hot swelling does not occur.  If a hot swelling does occur, then leave its reduction until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides, and do not touch it on the third and fourth days at all, as it is subject to adverse symptoms.
If the broken bone is protruding, exposed through the skin, you should try to reduce and straighten it with your hands gently and with slight extension.  If you are unable to reduce and straighten it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, its length about seven or eight fingers. وعرضها على قدر الجرح.
Therefore, the physician should make three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture, and let them be rounded with some thickness so that they do not bend when pressed upon during the operation.
And let them be sharp-edged, with a curve at their end, and let the upper part be thick, and from its middle downwards very thin.  And this is its form:
And it is called in Greek *perion*, meaning small lever. You should place its sharp, curved end on the protruding end of the bone, and push it at once so that when the bone returns and is somewhat straight, then complete the setting of the fracture ends on each other.
If its broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grip it. If you are absolutely unable to reduce the bone as we have described, then cut it with a similar one of the bone saws that we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws however you can. Then smooth out what remains on the bone of roughness and thin fragments. If you reduce the bone and the patient finds after its reduction a severe, troublesome pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
If you are able to return it to its natural place, then do so, for you will benefit the patient greatly. When you have completed your setting of the bone, soak a rag in black astringent wine, especially if it is in summer. Do not place on the wound cerate or anything containing fat.
so that putrefaction and corruption do not occur in it. Then apply the splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole the size of the wound in the bandages with scissors.
Be very careful not to tighten the wound together with the fracture, for ignorant doctors often do that, and they cause their patients either death or gangrene or a foul ulcer. Let your tightening be gentle and loose, different from the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms that we have described, and he feels a disturbing pain in the area, then you should not put splints on it, but make bandages of firm rags in the place of the splints and bind it with them.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the cloth that you placed on it with the wine, and then use the lint and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like. And you should loosen the bandage.
And check the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and recovers. And you should position the limb so that the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound persists for many days and does not heal and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small bone fragments.
You should probe the wound, and whatever fragments are loose, extract and remove them; and those that are not loose, and are pricking the limb and causing pain, be diligent in cutting and extracting them in any way you can.
If the wound develops a cold, or erosion, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with its corresponding treatment, as previously described in its chapter.
And it is important to heed my words and bear in mind that if a large bone is broken and protruding from the limb, such as the femur, humerus, or similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it. فكثيرا ما يعرض من ذلك الموت بل اتركه حتّى يتعفّن فربّما سقط من ذاته بعد عشرين يوما او ثلاثين.
Then treat the wound if you see a need for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of stiffness that occurs after some fractures.
This stiffness often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near the joints, which deforms the limb and may prevent it from functioning normally.
Examine it, and if the stiffness is soft, use astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gentian, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the stiffness in a compress and tie it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the stiffness is gone, God willing, or apply a tightly fitted lead plate.
Lead has a special property that removes any outgrowth on the limbs. If the stiffness has hardened and intensified, and the necessity to remove it is urgent, incise it from above and cut or scrape the protruding excess with a scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it has healed but the limb remains thinner than its original form.
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak, it is due to many reasons. أحدها إمّا لكثرة حلّ الرباطات وربطها على غير ما ينبغى وإمّا لإفراط شدّ الرباطات حتّى امتنع الغذاء أن يسرى الى العضو وإمّا لكثرة التنطيل المفرط وإمّا لحركات مفرطة فى غير وقتها وإمّا لقلّة الدم فى جسد العليل وضعفه.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until his blood increases, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so forth. Then, apply tar to the limb so that the tar draws much nourishment to it, or continuously suspend it in lukewarm water. حتّى يجرى الغذاء فيه ويعود الى شكله الطبيعىّ،.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a protrusion of the fractured bone appears, or a knot, and the form of the limb is therefore ugly. إلّا أنّ العضو لم يمتنع عن فعله الطبيعىّ فليس ينبغى أن تقبل قول من يزعم أن يكسر العضو من رأس وقد كان كثير من جهّال الأطبّاء والمجبّرين يفعلون ذلك فى بلدنا.
This practice is very reprehensible and leads to great dangers, the least of which is permanent damage. However, if the crookedness and knot are soft, it should be poulticed with water in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and root, melilot, and the like.
It should be dressed with softening bandages, such as expertly made diachylon, or the mucilage of marshmallow root may be taken and mixed with chicken fat and fresh butter and applied as a dressing, or ripe figs may be pounded with pigeon dung and similar medications that are called resolvents.
The knot may also be resolved with constant gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.  If the crookedness is old and severe, and hardened, and the necessity arises to treat it with iron.
It should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess knot or bone should be cut with fine cutters, and gentleness should be used in this with great effort and care. Then the wound should be treated as mentioned previously until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
Dislocation of the jaw is a displacement of the joint from its place, which hinders movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe aches and pains to the patient.  Whenever someone experiences a jaw dislocation, it should be promptly reduced.
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the area will swell, making it difficult to reduce the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while swollen, because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reduce it and treat each limb as will be mentioned in its place.
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what preceded in the fracture, from the top of the body to the bottom.

On the treatment of the lower jaw.
Rarely do the two jaws dislocate, except in rare cases, and their dislocation is in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions so that they relax a little, or they are completely and totally dislocated so that they relax. الى نحو الصدر حتّى يسيل لعاب العليل ولا يستطيع إمساكه ولا يطيق أن يطبّق فكّه ويتلجلج لسانه بالكلام، فأمّا إن كان تخلّعه يسيرا فقد يرجع فى أكثر الأحوال من ذاته بأيسر شىء.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, you should quickly reduce it and not delay it at all.  This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is on one side.
Or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is on both sides, and the rest of the fingers of his hands from the outside, he adjusts with them, and orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go in every direction, and the physician adjusts the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved, then use a compress with hot water and oil until it is easy to reduce them, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we have said. When they return and are aligned and the patient's mouth is closed and they do not relax, then place bandages of cloth on them with cerate made of wax and rose oil.
Then tie gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back and his head elevated between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not try to chew anything, but rather makes his food a soft broth.
So when the pain is gone and the jaw is set, let him eat what he wants, and let him do so gently and not force open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and constant headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels will loosen, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile repeatedly. If you see this, know that it is corrupted.
And often one who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection to the chest, but it may be dislocated outward, and that is apparent to the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return. Then you apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for the end that is next to and connected to the shoulder, it is rarely dislocated. If it is ever dislocated, it should be reduced and straightened as we have described, and as you are able.
Then you put on it the bandage, supports, and tightening, and order the patient to remain still and at rest until he recovers.  With this same treatment, you reduce the tip of the shoulder if it also shifts from its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in three ways: one is that it is dislocated towards the armpit downwards, the second is that it is dislocated towards the chest, and sometimes it is dislocated above the shoulder, and that is rare.
It does not dislocate backwards because of the scapula, and it does not dislocate forwards because of the nerves. It mostly dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is little, because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them.
As for those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty. Sometimes a person suffers a blow or a fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so it is thought that it has been dislocated. It is necessary to examine it until you determine its true condition.
Then you proceed with its treatment.  The dislocation, if it is downwards towards the armpit, is recognized if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy shoulder. You will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder indented and, when touching under the armpit, the head of the shoulder is like an egg.
The patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or to move it with all movements. Likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, you will find that apparent to the touch, it will not be hidden.
This dislocation can be easily reduced if it is fresh or if the patient is a child. To reduce it, an assistant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and strongly lift the joint upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he brings it down, and it will return quickly. If it does not return with what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been present for many days, it is necessary that the patient bathe in hot water and use an emollient that relaxes and softens, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderately soft and firm. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place. And if you wish, you reduce it in this way: you bring a man taller than the patient and have him stand at the side and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lift his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. وخادم آخر يجذب يد العليل الى أسفل بطنه فإن كان العليل خفيفا فينبغى أن يعلّق به شىء آخر ليثقّله فإنّه يرجع الفكّ من ساعته، وقد يردّ أيضا على وجه آخر.
It is that you fix in the ground a long piece of wood whose top is rounded like the rim of a mortar, neither thick nor thin. Then you place it under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on the top of the wood, the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side and also extend his body from the other side with force, and the joint will quickly return to its place. If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. وعرضها قدر أربع أصابع وغلظها قدر أصبعين يكون لها رأس مستدير ليسهل دخولها فى عمق الإبط على هذه الصورة:.
Then you tie soft cloths on the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient, then it is placed under the armpit and the entire hand and forearm are extended down along the wood, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and the edge of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a horizontal beam of a ladder, and the hand is extended downwards and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, and the joint will enter immediately. When it has entered by any possible means, then it is necessary to place a moderately sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then the prepared dressing of mill dust with frankincense and egg white is carried over the entire shoulder as it revolves from above, then the ball is tightened firmly from under the armpit and the bandage is wrapped over the dressing from above, and his hand is suspended from his neck.
And he is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be made small so that the limb strengthens, for it is faster for his recovery. Then after seven or five days it is loosened and he practices movement, and if it is stable and does not relax, then he has recovered.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to an acquired moisture or another ailment, then cauterization with the three needles should be used as described previously in the chapter on cauterization. If you do all of this and loosen the bandage after seven days and the joint is not stable.
And you repeat the dressing and tightening on it several times and it does not stabilize and falls and loosens and you are not able to raise it upward, then know that its nerve which is at the top of the shoulder has been severed or stretched or loosened. Know then that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the dislocation which is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns, and all the tightening and treatment are used on it until it heals. If after healing, there occurs heaviness in the limb and slowness in movement,
then the patient should use the bath frequently until that heaviness softens and it returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards, and its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it occurs under the sight and under the touch, in whatever form it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it will become clear to you with clear evidence, by the hollowness of the joint, and he cannot bend his arm, nor can he touch his shoulder with it.  And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.
For if a hot swelling occurs, it is difficult to reduce it, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards, for it is the worst of all kinds of dislocations and the most painful, and death often occurs with it.
Its treatment, if it is of the kind that can be reduced, is that an assistant extends his arm with both his hands, his arm outstretched, and the physician's hands are above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with both his thumbs, or with the base of his hand, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand suddenly until it strikes with the base of its palm the shoulder which it faces.  If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then use very strong, powerful extension, which is that two assistants extend the arm.
And two assistants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a folded cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around his hand. And when the physician treats the joint with his hands, he anoints them with oil so that it will help in sliding the joint easily.
Then he pushes the joint forcefully until it returns. After its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage which has astringency and desiccation with egg white, and it is tightened firmly, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is loosened. If the joint is stable in its place, then remove the bandage and leave it. And if you see that the joint has not become firm enough, then replace the bandage and leave it also for several days until it becomes firm, then remove it. If it develops a callosity after the return of the joint and its release,
and difficulty in movement, then he should use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and kneading until it softens. Or place the omentum of a fat ram on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on him for a day and a night. Then remove it and have him enter the bath, and when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then replace the omentum a second and third time, along with entering the bath, until it softens. And if you want to put on it fresh, light cow dung with fat and bandage it on him, do so several times, for it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of dislocation of the wrist.
The wrist joint is frequently dislocated.  Its reduction is easier than other joints, except that it should be reduced quickly, at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot swelling appears in it.
Its reduction is done by placing the patient's wrist on a board and an assistant extends his hand. The physician puts his palm on the protuberance of the joint and pushes it until it returns. However, it should be observed whether the dislocation has moved towards the inside of the hand.
So let the patient place the back of his hand on the board when extending and reducing. And if the dislocation protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the protuberance of the joint itself.  If it returns immediately, good. Otherwise, bandage it with a dressing that reduces swelling.
And leave it; do not try again, for it will not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked.  And it will not harm the patient at all, unless the hand is weakened and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except to cauterize it. Perhaps this will be beneficial, and perhaps it will be of no use.  When the wrist reduction is complete, apply the dressing that we described, then bandage it and leave it for five days.
Then untie it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, soften it with warm water and massage it repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction.  When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place). Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the side to which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days then release it and extend it so that it becomes straight during that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner. Continue to release it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it becomes strong.
And likewise, do the same if it is dislocated towards the inside of the hand, binding it towards the same side. Do with it as you did before until it heals.  And likewise, do the same whenever it is dislocated in other directions.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When a complete dislocation of one of the vertebrae of the back or neck occurs, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it, because death comes quickly to the ill person.
And the sign of this is that the patient's feces come out involuntarily, he cannot hold it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs, his arms, or one of them.  However, if a single vertebra is displaced from its position, it can often be corrected.
Its displacement can be in four directions. The one that dislocates posteriorly is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor is there any cure at all. However, for one that occurred due to a fall, a blow, or something similar...
The ancients have mentioned it with various kinds of treatment in lengthy discussions, most of which are not beneficial. I have summarized from that what little suffices instead of much of what they have presented, by my approaching the meaning and explaining it. I have also depicted the instrument differently from what they have illustrated and explained.
So I say that the hump which occurs from the front in the chest has no remedy and no cure from it, and likewise the ones to the two sides also. Only the one which occurs in the back is specifically treated by what I will describe, which is to lay the patient on his face.
On a level bench near a wall, and spread a damp cloth underneath him so that his chest will not be hurt. Then place a vertical wooden plank, fixed in a hole in the ground, at the edge of the bench toward his head and another wooden plank toward his feet at the other edge of the bench.
An assistant holds the plank – let it not be fixed in the hole – and another assistant holds the other one in the same manner. Then, wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage and extend the end of the bandage to the plank which is at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his thighs, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other plank which is at his feet. Then each assistant pulls the plank in his direction with the bandage, and the two planks do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his palms on the vertebra with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board which is about three cubits long.
And dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place to insert the end of the board. Then you place the middle of the board on the hump and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls well until the vertebra is pressed.
And it returns to its place. And if you want to do it with the screw that is turned by hand, that is, you fix in the ground at the patient's head, at the end of the bench, two planks, the length of which is a cubit, and at his feet, at the end of the bench as well, two planks.
And let the distance between each plank be a span, and in each plank a hole is made through which the screw runs. And all the planks are firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all. And you insert a rounded rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is fixed with which it is twisted, and in the other two planks, the same. Then you tighten the bandage that you tightened on the patient's chest in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened on his legs in the screw that is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, turning his hand with the turner with which the screw is turned, and the physician straightens the hump as we have described. And this is a picture of the screw, the bench, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place becomes straight, it is necessary to apply the desiccative dressing with egg white, then the splint, then you place on top of the dressing a splint made of a board whose width is three fingers or so, and whose length is enough to cover the hump.
And on some healthy beads, then it is tied with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, it is necessary to use the medications that relax and soften with the use of the board that we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used for that. A protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, but it is an extra bone that has grown, so do not treat it with this treatment, as death may occur.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the treatment of dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation and are not subject to what happens to other joints, such as slight displacement and depression. The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward. Most often it dislocates inward, and rarely forward or backward. The sign of its inward dislocation is that if you compare the patient's healthy leg to the diseased one, it is longer.
And the knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient is unable to bend his leg at the groin, and the place next to the groin is swollen and the swelling is apparent because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of outward dislocation are opposite to these symptoms. The sign of forward dislocation is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forward.
And his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking, he steps on his heel. The sign of backward dislocation is that he does not extend the knee and cannot bend it before bending at the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is apparent at the location of the hip.  As for the reduction of these types of dislocation, you should observe: if the dislocation is old, long-standing with the patient, and no attempt has been made to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
So, you should not attempt to treat it.  However, if the dislocation is recent, whichever of the four directions it may be, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inward and outward, and move it right and left, perhaps...
it will return and not need any other treatment.  If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong, robust assistant to extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied on his leg above the knee, and another assistant to extend it from above.
by putting his hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage on the base of the thigh. Another, third assistant should hold the end of the bandage and extend it either from the front, from the area of the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
And they should all extend at once, so that the patient is raised by his body off the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to the four types. If the dislocation is reduced by what we have said, then fine, otherwise each type will require the specific treatment that I will describe.
As for the specific reduction if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then you place a bandage at the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the groin.
Then extend the bandage upwards from the area of the groin to the upper body, towards the clavicle. Then another strong assistant takes hold with his arms and grasps the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with strong extension, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than all other types of treatment that reduce this limb. If you find it difficult and it does not respond to entering with this type of treatment at all, then you should tie both of the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.
And it should be after each of them from its companion the length of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.  Then the patient is suspended by the head from a beam that is in the house, and his distance from the ground should be about two cubits.
Then you order a strong young man to grasp the head of the femur, and another young man hangs onto the patient, and the other young man grasping the femur pushes strongly, and the joint will quickly return to its place.  As for its specific reduction if the jaw is dislocated outwards...
The patient should lie down on the bench as we described for the patient with a hump, and the bandage should be tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then the two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. Then an additional piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened.
It should be wrapped with damp rags so that it does not harm the patient, so that the wood is between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downwards during the extension.  Then each assistant extends to his side, and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands. If it responds to the reduction...
If not, then place the board on it and compress it as we mentioned for the hump, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended at once while he is in this exact same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, then presses it with the other hand, and with that, the pressure should be directed downwards towards the knee.  And if the dislocation is backwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards.
He should be raised above the ground, rather he should be placed on something solid, as should also be the case for one whose hip has been dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned regarding his lying on the bench on his face, with the bandages tightened.
as we said before. And compression with the board should also be used on the area where the joint has dislocated. When the return of the hip joint is complete as it should be, and the sign of its return is not hidden from you – which is that you extend the patient's legs.
And if you see them level, and the patient flexes and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and tie it with a turban, tying it so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient should remain still for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and dressing and compare the leg with the other.  If you see them equal in length, know that the dislocation has been stabilized.  Then allow the patient to walk.  But if you see any looseness in it,
return and bandage it and tighten it as you did the first time, and leave it for three days, then loosen it. He should walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the Treatment of Knee Dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three ways: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards—I mean backwards—and it does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to press his leg against his thigh.
If it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all its dislocations is to have the patient sit down with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and have an assistant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend it back a little, then you sit on his thighs.
Place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking your fingers over his knee. Then squeeze the sides of his knee firmly with your palms, while another assistant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without force. Then bandage it and press the leg against the thigh, then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only undertake a little walking for several days until it strengthens.
If its return is difficult for you using what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages that we described previously in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
The heel may be slightly displaced or completely dislocated. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding to the side to which it is dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce it. It is to be extended gently with the hands and straightened until it returns. As for its treatment when it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit down and be held by a strong assistant, supported from behind his back at his waist.
Then you take his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the place of the Achilles tendon. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left twice, then extend it with the left and push the instep with the right towards the leg without violence.
Do this twice as described, then push the instep to the leg the third time while you pull the Achilles tendon. If it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot is straight, then stop.  Otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If its reduction is difficult for you by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a strong stake in the ground to be placed between his thighs, having wrapped rags around it so that it does not harm the patient. Then an assistant should hold his thigh.
Then another assistant extends the leg, either with his hands or with a strap that he ties around the ankle of the leg. Then each assistant pulls in the opposite direction of his companion, and the stake stands between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension. Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands.
And another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards, for the dislocation will return quickly. When the dislocation has returned and you are sure of its proper reduction, apply the dressing and the splint and tighten it with firm bandages and tie the foot downwards with the bandage. You should be wary of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
So that the bandaging is not too tight on it and harms it. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandaging loosens, tighten it, then remove it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be ruined and will not thereafter accept treatment.  If a hot swelling occurs to him, then you should use to soothe it what we have described previously in other places of treatment and poulticing until it goes away.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
You should straighten what has dislocated from it by gentle extension without force, and that is not difficult, rather it is easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then the patient should place his foot on a level place on the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you stand and place your foot on whatever protrudes from those joints, then press it down with your foot forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straightened and no protrusion appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that takes the entire foot, which has two ends, then tighten it firmly and securely for three days, then loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
Whenever something like that happens and I wanted to treat and set it, it often resulted in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skilled in the craft, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor bold, and he should use in the beginning only the medicines that soothe hot swellings, and surrender to the patient's condition.
Except what you hope for safety from damage with the mildness of the illness, and you see in it some hope, then reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as you intended, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with what is appropriate for it from the drying ointments. If the dislocation is with a fracture and fragments appear in the bone that are loose, then extract them. وامتثل فى ذلك ما ذكرنا فى الأمراض البسيطة ممّا تقدّم فى مواضعها.
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of danger, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your reputation, God willing.
