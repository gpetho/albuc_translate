Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed this book for you, my son, which is the last of the sciences in medicine with its complement, and having reached the end of it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since operation with the hand has been neglected in our region and time, and perhaps the science of it has entirely perished and its trace has been lost, and only a few small descriptions remain in ancient books which have been changed by hand: and they have suffered error and doubt until their intentions were closed and its vision was lengthened. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the order of this treatise in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of Cauterii's tools, and other instruments of work: because it is made from its addition of declaration, and its operation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman of it is not found with his own hand in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and one must be exercised in its author before that in the science of anatomy which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exit, and the pulsatilium of veins, and quiet places, and the exits of their places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy cannot be purged from error, and will fall into the error by which men perish: just as I have seen many from among them who are formed from this science, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is, because I have seen a stupid doctor cut an abscess of the scrophula on the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in the neck: therefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he reached him, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the weakness of the man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another doctor who received a bribe from a certain duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to the black eunuch who was with him, a fracture near the calcaneum of his leg: and the doctor rushed with his ignorance, and he bound the fracture over the wound with cotton, and stars, and a strong bandage, and did not let out the wound's expiration.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he healed him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he sent him away for several days, and commanded him not to untie the bandage: and it stayed like that until his leg was an abscess, and his foot, and it reached his destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Then I was called to him: and I rushed to untie the bandage: and there followed peace, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to walk in the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who punctured the cancerous abscess: and it became an ulcer after days, until its wickedness was revealed to its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is to say, because when the cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary for it to reach him with iron at all, unless there is in the member that can bear, so that the whole of it be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, my son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation to which health is associated, and the operation, with which there is danger in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already awakened in every place of this book, in which the operation comes, in which there is fear and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and leave it: so that the fool may not find a way to speak, and disgrace.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Take therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading to salvation and laudable success through the grace of God: and leave terrible difficulties of healing: and take away your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitancy may enter upon you in your faith and your good.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is rather remaining to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You shall not apply harmful remedies: lest you be called bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have, however, divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter One: On the use of fire and sharp medicine, arranged from beginning to end, including the forms of instruments and tools for cauterization, and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter Two: On cutting and piercing, bloodletting and incision, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and all arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Chapter Three: On restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things; arranged from beginning to end, and according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On cauterization and its harm, and with which constitutions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	However, before I mention the operation with it, it is necessary to tell of the quality of its cauterization and its harm: and in which constitution it should be shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the speech about the quality of cauterization and its harm is a long and subtle science, and an occult secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	For indeed there was much talk about it among the wise men, and they disagreed in it: and to me, however, it is not enough from their words, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cauterization brings universally to every constitution, which is with matter, and without matter: excepting two constitutions, which are the constitution hot without matter, and the constitution dry without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in a hot and dry compound with matter, they separated.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For indeed some said that the cauterizing iron of the juvenile was in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that the cauterizing iron is not suitable for the ailment, which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and unsuitable, so as to be healed from the ailment hot and dry, with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of that: that through cauterizing, a cure is made in every hot and dry ailment which occurs in human bodies: because when you compare the body of man, and his humidities, to the compound of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed I say by his speech: because from experiment he has extracted that from me many times already.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary, unless he who has already been tested, and exercised in the chapter of cauterization exercise lastly, and knows the diversity of human compounds, and the disposition of ailments in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	But from other compounds there is no fear on you: and especially in cold and wet ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all doctors have now gathered on them: and they did not separate in the cure with cauterizing in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, O sons, that from the secret of the cure with cauterizing and fire, and its goodness over cauterizing with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member which is being cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, unless a small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of medicine has reached the point where it extends beyond the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire due to its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now indeed we have become aware of that through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the position on the truth of things: and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not allowed to this my book, I would bring you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies for its expulsion, which expels difficulties demonstrated by philosophical speech, which would be remembered by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they themselves disagree at the time when it is fitting to do cauterization, and put a better time for true.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say, that cauterization is fitting at all times: because the accidental harm is submerged in benefit, which is drawn with the cauterizer.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Especially if cauterization is for pain from necessary pains, strong, urgent ones who do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that something evil may happen which is greater than the small harm that comes through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And may not fall into your minds, sons, that which they do not fear, namely the common people and stupid doctors, namely that to the pain which is healed by cauterization, there is not always return: and they put this consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in the place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries the humidities which are the cause why pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cauterizing instrument exceeds medicine by its speed of healing, and its effectiveness of operation, and its forcefulness of dominance: and it is possible that the sickness returns at some hour of a time according to the temperament of the infirm, and the location of his sickness, and its virtue: and that which is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in him: and that which reaches him in his acquisition of it from foods, and similar ones to those, unless sickness occurs, in which the cauterizing is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle sickness in a member of few superfluities, and moistures, such as the cauterizing of the tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that that pain does not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the talk of the common people again, that the cauterizing is the last of medicine, is right: not to that which they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which confers with medicine, nor with another after the falling of the cauterizing.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is contrary to that, and intent, that the cauterizing is the last of medicine, is not, unless when we administer modes of cure in some sickness, and those medicines do not confer: then we administer at the end of the matter cauterizing, and it confers: then from there it falls, that the cauterizing is the last of medicine, not according to the understanding which the common people and many stupid physicians intend.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said, that the cauterizing with gold is better than the cauterizing with iron: and they did not say that, unless because of the equality of gold, and sublimity of its substance: and they said, that it does not make a pus place of the cauterizing.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, it is not absolutely true that I have already proven and discovered that this does not work in certain bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And the cautery iron itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you use the cautery iron in fire from gold, it is not declared to you when it burns according to the quantity you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it rushes to the heat, and if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from this into his trade: and for that reason, the cautery iron with iron is faster and closer to us in relation to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have already arranged this Chapter on the Cautery in order according to chapters, and I have arranged them from the head to the feet, so that those seeking something from it may find it easily.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Chapter on the Method of Cauterying the Head at the Commissural Line.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cautery application gives control over moisture and cold above the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and a multitude of fluids flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain, and general all kinds of discomfort that occur from cold, such as paralysis, and sweating, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses to these diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterying is that you order the sick person: so that he may be emptied in the first place with a cleansing solution for the head three nights, or four, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your thumb on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever your middle finger reaches that spot, mark that location with an unclean (mark).
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the cauterizing iron, which has this shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with the unclean (mark), with a downward movement, by which your hand is gradually constricted, and you turn it back.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly withdraw your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the bone quantity of the head is already detached, or the quantity of zeuberg, then withdraw your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it is cooled: until the bones that I told you about are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it with the wound: and put it on that spot, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the salve on top of that which was drunk with butter, and leave it on the spot until the scar of the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the quadripharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that the more the wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized until the bone: and the cauterizing iron should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then, after it has been set and become hardened from the bone, it should be dressed.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Some say that it is necessary to apply the cautery directly to the bone until an impression is made in the bone, so that the bone falls off as if by a kirate: or with an instrument similar to one used by women for writing small letters: and they believe that vapors from the head will escape from this place, and the wound will be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be dressed until it has become hardened.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	In my opinion, these two kinds of cautery are not seen at all in all men except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better to leave it alone with its own health, in my opinion.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened from the solution of its own natural continuity: as we have shown in other members: and especially when the head of an infirm person is weak by nature: and indeed the first kind of cautery is more saving and better for me, and I use it: therefore work with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When pain in the whole head is chronic and prolonged in an infirm person, and he uses herbs, and coals, and purgatives, and oils, and fomentations.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if he has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have mentioned, and does not give him anything from those: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the infirm person is strong by nature, and is not weak, and has found a violent cold: then cauterize with another cautery under it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above all the horns of its own head with the cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And burn it with a single cauterizing tool at the back of its head, in the place called the 'navel': and it is the location where the windpipe is placed. And lift up your mat (or bed) in this, and do not uncover its mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For indeed it found itself due to this intense pain, and different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this Cauterium in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterizing tool, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head more subtly with a cauterizing tool, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with the burning drug and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it happens that pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and is evacuated with cleansing drugs for the head, and the rest of the cure, which I said in the divisions of ailments, and not all of it: then cauterization in that is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning drug: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But the cauterizing tool with a sharp burning drug is, as you take one tooth of garlic, and scrape it, and cut off its ends from two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of the pain at the time with a wide lancet, until it becomes in it a place under the skin, in which the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into that under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind it above with a suitable amount of cotton, and release it after fifteen hours, and remove the garlic, and let it rest for two or three days: afterwards put butter soaked cloth on top of it, until the place becomes pus: then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines which I have written about in my twelfth treatise on burning remedies.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Indeed, the cautery of it with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cauterizing iron, which has this shape.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Claw: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a claw, in which there is something curved, and in the middle of it is a small elevation.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and you will turn the iron gradually with speed: and the quantity that is burned from the thickness of the skin, is like its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below does not burn, and blood flows.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the wound in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cautery this hemicrania with the second edge of the knife of the cauterizer.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And avoid from incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not anciently proper.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ On the manner of cauterying in ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating hemicrania, with that which we said from the previous cure, and what we said in divisions of ailments, and it does not benefit him: and you see from the ailment, that it is not sufficient to him what we said from the first cauterizing with medicine, or with cauterizer with fire, then it is necessary to burn the knife cauterizer, until it becomes white after the signs of pain on the spot, whose length is the middle of the finger, or rather that: and place your hand one vice [?] and stretch it until you cut the artery, and reach up to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest it be burned or a nerve that moves it be affected, from which spasm may arise.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And let this be over the guard and the precaution of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its division there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what it does, and is not eager or experienced: and he leaves the operation with him first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the remembrance of the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	But if you see from the pain that this cauterizer does not suffice for him, and you see the weak body bearing the cauterizer in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until he is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterizer that we said in the chapter of extracting the artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more suitable.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	About the method of cauterizing in pain of the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When it happens that pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is cured with solutions, and the other cure that we said in division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is called a punctum, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then puncta with it after its ignition in the circumference of the ear entirely, as it is turned around: or in the circumference of both, if the pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And draw yourself away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with the cauterizer: and let the quantity of the cauterizer be ten puncta in every ear, and so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the affected areas until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured with cauterization is only from certain species that occur from phlebitis, as we mentioned in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the lack of cauterization of this species, which occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with honey, and headpurges, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the sick person with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and second somewhat lower from his temple, and third at the connection of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur, except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, to cauterize the same cauterization instrument directly at the tip of the upper ear under the horn of the head somewhat: and another in the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cauterization instrument until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cauterization instrument, and it is a species from a knife, whose form was mentioned before: however, it is not too thin, as you see: and it should be that the knife is somewhat lacking in thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the affected areas, with what preceded, until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When ancient apoplexy is cured, and you treat it with what we mentioned, and your medication does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations over all the horn of his head, and with the cauterization instrument in the middle of his head, as we mentioned, and with the cauterization instrument in the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the mode of cauterization should be according to what preceded.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person all over, and place on his occipital bone the plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and place it repeatedly.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is indeed the method of cauterization: and do it according to the order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by this, good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then do to him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the superior part of his head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between every cauterization the thickness of a finger.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize him in the middle of his head, and with cauterization on every horn of his head, and with cauterization on his posterior, and three on his spinal processes.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If you lack the necessary skills in mollification of the body and are weak in tolerating pain, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the spines of his back, and the last one with the cauteri, until most of his skin is burned off, and lift your hand.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, you must first cleanse his brain with hyeris, and with the rest of the cure that we mentioned in the division, when he is weak, or unable to bear medicines.

If he is a child who cannot bear medicines, then give him a gargle, and cleansing mouthpieces to cleanse his brain, before many days with good nourishment.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.

And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of humors flowing down to melancholy, and there is a weak humid body, then give it a drink that cleanses its brain, according to what preceded in division: then shave the weak head, and make afterwards a well-made tortellini from linen, like a circle.

And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows slightly with two cauterizers in every part: and they should be lengthened from two temples: and the length of all cauterizers should be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not extend your hand with the cauterizer, but according to the quantity that burns the third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are facing away from the eye and are sharp.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterizer in that is according to two methods: either a cauterizer with fire: or a cauterizer with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the cauterizer with fire, order the sick person before it, so that he may let go of his hairs, if it is from those who shave them, until they are lengthened and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they are pricked by them at the time of their birth: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and equalized, then place the head of the sick person in your lap: afterwards mark the eyelids with a pencil, with the sign that it is according to the form of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a wet cloth soaked in egg white: or in the mucilage of psyllium on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then with a cauterizing iron, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize above the sign that you marked on the eyelids many times, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the form of the myrtle leaf, entirely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hairs raised near the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Raise therefore your hand then: and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on him a cloth with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If however some of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid is softened: then repeat the cauterizing iron on that place, as you did in the first time.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize that, until it is raised to its natural place: and equalized so that they do not prick the eye with the hairs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	¶ On how to cauterize with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is that you command the sick person, that he let go of the hairs, until they lengthen and equalize.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a leaf from paper and cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take equal amounts of known soap and dry, unmixed powdered chalk, each weighing one ounce or about that amount: then grind them together well, and make it into a paste quickly, so that it does not harden.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take a piece of the paste from the one you made and spread it on the paper in the shape of a leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a wet compress soaked in egg white: and let the sick person rest in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your finger on the remedy and press it gently.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the remedy, for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	And while he continues to feel this bite that he found, then remove the remedy and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	And when the bite stops, then remove the remedy and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider whether you see the eyelid swelling, as it does with contraction with fire or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat over it from the remedy on the place where it does not press the remedy and does not stain, until your operation equals and the eye closes.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a wet compress with butter on it until the skin burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphanicon ointment or another one, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard the last guardianship, lest something fall into the eye from the remedy.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days and something fights from the hair in the eye, then repeat the remedy on that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did in the first place.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself until you are healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should know that human eyes differ in size and shape.

When you are treating a fistula, since as we said in the divisions of diseases, and your cure does not combine: then, it is necessary for you to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold his head between his hands in this way, so that he does not move, nor move his head with his own.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a compress soaked in white of egg, or in a mucilage of psyllium on his eye: then ignite the cauterizing iron, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be concave, like the shape of a quill pen's feather from one end, with which it is made into a cauterizing iron: and if you wish it to be penetrating up to the other end, and if you wish it to be upwards, then try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place then on it the cauterizing iron, which is made to burn very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold with it your hand for a little by the cauterizing iron from the eye, to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander, or disturb the sick person: and place the cauterizing iron in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you reach the beginning of your cauterizing instrument up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	But if not, then repeat the cauterizing instrument once or twice, depending on what you need from it, and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a bandage with butter on it, and care for it with drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days have passed and it has not healed: then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the mouth is opened: and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some first said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Bend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place in it a fine cannula, that is, a fine needle, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour in it a quantity of drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula with good retention, and not move it at all weakly, so that it does not run or reach the melted lead to its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should place on the weak eye's bandage an infused bandage on white of egg or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	But if the fistula is healed, with what we said from cauterizing and curing, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	But if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril hole, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what comes in its own place.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in a mouth ulcer.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gingiva, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus, and bursts: afterwards it becomes putrid, and pus runs out, and a fistula is formed: then care for it, and there is no cure for it, then it is necessary to use a heated knife according to the amount that can be taken into the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert it into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated knife reaches the depth and end of it, and do it once or twice.

When the gum is softened due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you care for it with medicines, and there is no cure: then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then, place the cauterizing iron, whose shape will be described later, on top of the tooth: and quickly insert the hot cauterizing instrument into it: and hold your hand there for a moment, until you feel the weak heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And then lift your hand: and then repeat the cauterizing instrument several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the weak person will fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and then spit it out.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing in tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is frost in it, or worms, and no cure is found with medicines: then the cauterizing instrument is used in two ways: either with butter: or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the cauterizing instrument with butter is, that you take boiled butter in an iron spoon, or in a brass vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and cover it over the outer part of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse a cloth, or a rag in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place a burning iron on top of it: until the fire reaches the deep hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But the cauterizing with fire is, that you direct it towards the nozzle of air, or the nozzle of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something rough on his body, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then place the cautery, which will come in the shape of a cautery, on his tooth: and hold your hand over it until the cautery is cooled down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary for the sick person to fill his mouth with good beurage after the impression of that cautery, and hold it for an hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cautery with whatever extremity you can, according to what is possible: and this is the shape of the tube.

Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophuli are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you want to quickly digest them: then place a flat cautery on fire, which has this shape.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke comes out from the cautery by the other extremity: and place it on fire over the abscess once, and secondly, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the amount of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it go for three days, and place on it a soft infusion in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the shape of the tube heals.

When moistures accumulate over the bronchial canal, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold constitution, then it is necessary for the sick person to be evacuated first with dissolved remedies.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize the affected part at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, do not let the cauterizer reach the throat, nor in the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize the affected part at the junction of the neck at the last spine of its end, and let the cauterizer be a sealing one according to the manner that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterizing in afflictions of the lungs and coughs.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.

When cough and affliction of the lungs are from cold moistures, and the sick person does not have fever, nor phthisis, and old affliction: then cauterize it with two cauterizers above the backbone in depressed, loose, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cauterizer in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cauterizer be a needle according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization is by puncturing with the cauterizer called Punctum, whose form preceded in puncturing pain of the ear: and there are punctures from thirty punctures almost to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what preceded until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cauterizer have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore it is relieved with that cauterization when you do it with one three-pronged cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	In the method of cauterizing in the tonsils, in the case of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and it does not return to its place at the time of its return from dislocation, until it becomes a habit for it to return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, as we have already testified, at that time you should reduce the dislocation in the first place.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should lie face down on his back, or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the blanket, which is on the inside of the tonsils towards the upper part with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint is dislocated towards the inside.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then hold the cauterizing iron having two holes.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the blanket until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of cauterization comes with four cautery irons.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cauterizing iron having three holes, so the figure of cauterization is made then with six cautery irons: and they are holes according to the thinness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cauterizing iron having three holes.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this mode, so there are eight cautery irons.

Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the patient stick to the tranquility, so that the limb does not move during any time until he is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it on the arm with a claw cautery, or with many cautery irons pricking.

When fever and excessive moisture occur in the stomach until it is removed from its surroundings, and more cataracts are multiplied to it, and frequent modes of treatment are not effective: then the sick person should be raised up on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, the cautery under the collarbone in the amount of one finger's width with the cautery clavicle, and two cauteries below from both sides of the cautery of one, until the figure of the cauteries triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And extend between each so that they do not connect when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the amount of two tertiary thicknesses of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery be made into this cautery one according to the form of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with the cautery that frightens it: and there are signs above the stomach punctured according to the amount that you wish with the encaustro: then cauterize it with the cautery of the puncture: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the kidney from cold and moisture, or from excessive dryness, until it exits its natural outflow with excessive outflow, and the sick person is healed, with that which we said, and does not improve in it: then it is necessary for the sick person to be raised up on his neck, and signs with the cautery three cauteries according to this form, and this amount of cauteries below the hypogastrium, where the arm of a man reaches: and let there be space that is the width of one finger between each cauterium: and let the cauterium be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned be from the thickness of the skin, and let the quantity of its middle not be added: and let it be a weak standing on its feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if it is not standing, then it is lying, which has already extended its legs and raised its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to perform this cautery with a knife, when you have skill and wisdom in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed to the cauterization to the end, and the thickness of the skin is burned throughout, why the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is delicate, therefore know this.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens, and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the weak pain invades, and there is gravity without sharpness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with sharp pain: and you see already, that its cure has fatigued the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore it is necessary for the weak to lean back on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the form of the location of the abscesses with the cautery: then ignite the cautery which is like a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that cautery one, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the sinews, until all the pus comes out: then care for him with the cure of the wounds, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this cauterization species, unless whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hand these miseries with experiment many times: then for he dares on this operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	Indeed, it is better to let her go, with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be applied to Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you should take from the dry roots of Aristolochia a long one, the longest root that can be found, and it should be as thick as the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and light it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with a cautery one in that which is between the continuity of the ribs with the neck, and two small cauteries under the guides slightly inclined to the part that is under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined to the backs a little: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and with another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the backs: one in that which is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from two sides of the chest, lower cauteria that is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be in plain sight on the skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that from men there are those who use a cautery from iron like a ray: and they burn, and they put it inside in that which is between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the aposteme, and the pus comes out: as we said in the aposteme of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this puncturing with the cautery it is from fear, that either he dies weak immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32 on the method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating the spleen ailment, since as we mentioned earlier in the cure of divisions, and your treatment does not restore it, then cauterization is applied to it in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to perform three or four cauterizations along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure precedes it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cauterization a quantity of thickness like that of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of cauterization be as we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterization: and let him be weak and lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you have a two-pronged cauterization, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and elevate the skin, which is on the spleen directly, where the elbow of the weak left hand reaches: and your elevation be as you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning prongs deeply until you pierce the skin from the other side: then remove the cauterization: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterization having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterization after you have dismissed it, by emitting the pus over many days: for it is more beneficial than all that came before in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Chapter 32 on the method of cauterizing in hydrocele.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall in hydrocephalus, unless properly trained.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating hydrocephalus with the methods of cure that we mentioned in the division, and do not combine the cure, then it is necessary to cauterize the affected area with four cauteries around the umbilicus, and one cauterization on the stomach, and one on the spleen, and two cauterizations after the back between the vertebrae, and one in direct pectoris, and one in direct stomachi: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it may emit pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not evacuate the patient from treatment after the cauterization with him: which is necessary that two intentions should gather to him: and he will quickly approach him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	Indeed, the form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be closed: according to what preceded its form: and the form of the one with which the back is cauterized should be oily according to what preceded its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When blisters form in hydrocephalus, and are filled with yellow water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not rub it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water flows out, and the cautery is according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on both legs, and let the cautery be made with the tip of the cautery knife: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, near the middle of the leg: and two cauterizations on each hip: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some water may flow out from it: then treat it with the rest which we said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in the operation of ventroscopy.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers that are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with methods of cure, but not healed: and you see an infirm person tolerating an excessive cauterizing instrument, then cauterize him with a large cauterizing iron on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the cauterizing circle, and four cauterizing needles in the circumference of the umbilicus, with the thin cauterizing needle: and cauterize him above the alcatin on the alhosos with a large one, or with two cauterizing irons.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures, and the infirm person tolerating that, then cauterize him with a cauterizing iron on the comb, and cauterize him over all the belly: and perhaps add two small cauterizing needles near the large one on his stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For there is a cure that progresses, whose remedy does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick humors, cold, or corrupt moisture, and they are cured with that which we said in the division, and not by a single cure: then cauterize them with three cauterizing needles on the lower spondyle of the back slightly triangularly, and cauterize under the umbilicus as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face swell, then cauterize him on his stomach with a large cauterizing iron, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his epigastric region, and another above his spleen, with the thin cauterizing needle: and let the cauterizing iron rest open for some time: then cure him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing an ulcer after its removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the ulcer, then you burn the cauterizing iron that resembles a needle.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning iron into the removed ulcer: and let your last finger, until the cauterizing iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flowed, do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the ulcers are many, then cauterize each one with the cauterizing iron according to what we have told you.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them, with that which heals them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cauterizing iron over the ulcer, it is more harmful in wounding.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the incision and operation that we told you in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will be healed with the cauterizing iron.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to someone and is long-standing, pus runs from it, and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is more fitting that you should probe it with a fine needle.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the amount of its depth with the needle.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then burn the cauterizing iron, which is like a needle.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself the burning iron into the fistula and the amount in which it entered the lock.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the iron over it, until those corrupted bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the amount of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of the great vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think, because it is not perforating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then you know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the matter is not cut away from it, then you know that it is perforating, or there is a rotten hole in its depth, or something like that from those: whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys pain from cold, or from thick ventosity, and is reduced because of that weak breathing, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen, above the kidneys, with a cauterizer on all the kidney with the claw, whose memory has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it again in the second in that almethen.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why three straight lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more final in the cure.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in the bladder weakness, and softening from cold and moisture, until it does not retain the infirm urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the pili pectinis begin, and with a cauterizer from the right summit, and another from the left of that: and the length of that cauterization on the side should be according to the quantity of the thumb joint: and cauterize it with a cauterizer on the lower back, or with two cauterizers if you need them: and it should be according to what preceded the claw cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Of the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidity occur in the womb, and prevent impregnation, corrupt her menstruation, delay its provocation, and cause her pain upon its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize her three times around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cauterizing iron below her back, or with two cauterizations: and let the cauterizing iron be sharp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Of the method of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When humidity is exuded from the mucous membrane of the ankle to the joint, and becomes a cause for its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is prolonged over the other when they are compared together: and the location of dislocation is found empty in that place.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the sick person on the joint of their ankle with a similar cauterizing iron: after you have marked with the cauterizing iron in the circumference of the joint, as it revolves: and so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterizing iron be of a form that precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If that cauterizing iron is not present to you, then cauterize it three times with a large oil cauterizing iron: and let the depth of the cauterizing iron be according to the thickness of the skin of the entire.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Of the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the joint of the ankle, and the cause of this is cold and humidity: and the sick person is cured with it, as we mentioned in the division, and does not relieve the cure, and aggravates that: then it is necessary to dissolve the sick person from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization varies according to two methods: either with a cauterizing instrument and burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterizing instrument with fire has many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these methods is to cauterize on the pitcher of the anchor three triangular cauterizations, in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that is the quantity of the thickness of each finger: and let the cauterizing instrument be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cauterization is made in the middle on the head of the anchor.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, which precedes the form of dislocation of the anchor in one, so that it is a circle containing the whole anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of the whole.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain clings to the anchor itself and does not extend up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cauterizations on the hip, on the place where the infirmity indicates it, in which is the pain, and with your cauterizing instrument on the thigh four fingers towards the sylvestre part: and let the cauterizing instrument be a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the infirmity indicates that the pain extends up to near the fingers of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with the cauterizing instrument of the point, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If it is indicated that there is pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize that place with a single knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And burn yourself in every cauterization of yours, so that you do not end with the knife to this extent that you burn nerves, or a large artery, and pull through it over an injury, or a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the knee, and ended in cauterization, and the leg became inflamed, until a tumor resulted at the foot, and it was perforated throughout, and the whole foot rotted: then dissolution of the belly occurred, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each one according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said in cauterization of the ankle, which is this manner of the knife.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a knife similar to iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and it is at its own opening according to the thickness of a finger nail, or a little less: and within that knife is a third knife.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be space that is between all the knives by the thickness of a finger joint: and let the knives be open from both parts: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make them handles from iron fittingly attached in the knives.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then light it in the fire until it reddens, and throws sparks: then put it on a poultice of the ankle of the weak one lying on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round knives in one stroke.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and let the open wound heal over many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "In this manner of cauterization, my son, we are little used, due to the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because few do wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is from good cauterizations that he who suffers has found and has with him its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterizer, however, with medicaments burning is, that you do two samia having perforated a ring, in which descends the bolt of its gate from air, or iron, length of the wall: whose height of them are two knots, or as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space that is the quantity of thickness of a finger, and they are open below and above: and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay it on the iron hook, infirm one lying on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand on the iron hook much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire a little, and hold it for the time of an hour: and the infirm one bears its bite, and its burning, for he has found the bite as fire, until the bite is quiet.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then clean your hand with the instrument, and wipe off hot water from the hook entirely with sweet water: then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place on it butter, until the blackness of burning is removed: and let it be for several days, and wipe off pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in the healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that wound with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a splint in that which contains water, according to what you did in the anchor equal.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unextinguished lime, each one part of the same: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters inside the radius: and put under the bottom of the pot another glass pot: and throw on top of the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both through your finger: after which you compress it with your hand good compression: and leave the pot, until the sharp water descends the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather that whole water and throw it on top of another lime: and cook, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For this will then be very strong acid, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it effects the operation of its fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medicines with which the anchors are cauterized, there is also as a plaster, and honey of cashew, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen himself reported in his writings the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which he was cured of the pain of the anchor and the sciatic vein: and he praised it to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because it did not require other cure, and because he was cured of the vice of one, until he reported, because perhaps he had already entered the bath carried, and exited from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from fresh seterachi green: and if it is not found green, a dry one should be taken, newly picked, and it should be well pounded with some fat, and placed on the ancham where the pain is, or in the leg, or in the hip: and it should be bound, and let go for a quantity of three hours, or according to the quantity that the sick person feels sedation of the burn.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body becomes moist, introduce him into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain retreats, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use a cauterizing instrument with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that, when the droppings of a goat are cauterized with the sciatic nerve, it brings him: and it is made into a cauterizing instrument in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and it is imbued with old oil, and it is placed on the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the foot, and it is near the foot.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat droppings, and burn it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not therefore cease to do that, until the sense reaches above the medication up to the ancham, and the pain is quieted.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterizing is called the Vaccinum cauterizing.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	About the cauterization of the back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, or from an accident, or from a blow, or from an excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet matter: and the cauterizing instrument does not fall, except in this species alone, which is made from the infusion of cold and wet matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick with foul-smelling pills and similar things, three lines should be drawn across the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the sufferer's back, and five or more cauterizations should be made along each line with a hot iron, according to the tolerance of the sick person: and this should be done with a cautery-puncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, three or four cauterizations should be made with a middle hot iron in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing in the early stages of gout.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in children is: that a stricture occurs on him in breathing and movement, and it is found in the last rib and its knots, which is already beginning to project above the other ribs.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this and wish to do it, then cauterize that with a hot iron which is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he should take the hot iron over every part of the rib equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the rib with a pointed hot iron, two lines or three, and they should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place until he is healed with that which we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not apply the hot iron in gout, which occurs in spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing in podagra, and pain of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pain of the joints is from cold humors, which are poured out to any part of the body, then when pain occurs in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to call that podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore treating gout of the cold cause and when the means of cure do not remove the pains, then the cauterizer will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that the cauterizer should cauterize him after evacuation in the circumference of the joints of the feet, with many cauterizations: and let the cauterizer be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then do it with a cauterizer point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him over all the knee with three cauterizations, or four from every part, with this same cauterizer on the calf.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this cauterizer, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cauterizer, but rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees and back: then administer what we said from the cauterizer in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands: then make points in the circumference of the forearm, as two lines are rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains from the pains in the fingers: then make points on every joint, and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend up to the elbows, or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak one from good regimen, from the receipt of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be cured with the help of God with this cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	§ On the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is near the beginning: then you should order the sick person to abstain from food on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives so that feces descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the bladder, or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let him reduce it with your fingers, and sign with the cautery under the rupture on the tip of the pectoral, with a sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of the circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then light the cautery, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and throw sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let him reduce the intestine, or bladder, to its original shape.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let him place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed under it a pillow, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on him with the sign, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach the mouth with him: or repeat with him another time, if you did not reach with him in the first one up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your burning, lest you burn it, and he dies through that above the sick person or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach with the cautery to the mouth, your operation is not successful.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizing instrument for children should be delicate, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with other ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to give him food of a length of time for his healing, which soothes his stomach: so that the intestine does not go out at the time of defecation and excretion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And reduce his labor, and intake of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say the cure for hernias with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	But when the hernia occurs in the other belly, and they are beginning, and you do not want them to add, then cauterize his hernia with a round cauterizing instrument according to its quantity: and let that which is burned from then be as the third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him, with what we said: and do not add.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some have said first: that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cauterizing instrument, in this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is signed with the cauterizing instrument, and a line is placed which is through the width in the upper side of the hernia, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cauterizing instrument closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the cauterizing instrument first is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	¶ About how to cauterize in pains because of a fall, or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain members due to accident or blow: and the pain persists for a long time, and does not improve with medication: then it is necessary to cauterize with the point cauterizer.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cauterizer should be of the same size and strength as the member, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterizer on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the habituation of these pains, it is customary for them to change from member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with the cauterizer until the sick one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, sometimes lepers are healed with a great cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that is formed due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you want to cauterize it, consider.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	Therefore if the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it with what we said in division, and it has not descended nor stood: and you fear that corruption will spread over the whole of its complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it towards the front of the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally your hand with the cauterizer for a little, until it makes an impression on the mouth, and the bones are dislocated from it: so that the expiration of thick vapors is relieved from it, and also cauterize the spleen with the cauterizer, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we mentioned at the beginning, and a cauterizing iron on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizing irons on the two maxillae, and two cauterizing irons on the spines of the neck, and six cauterizing irons on the spines of the back, and one large one on the hollows at the base of the spine and one above it, in the middle of the back: and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the chest: and cauterize the entire joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize the soles of his feet, and the calluses of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And spare you the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes cauterize with a cauterizing iron on the palate, and another on the stomach, and another on the ear.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more cauterizing iron you add, the greater the benefit, and the greater the relief.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cauterizing iron, as healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizing irons be of appropriate size and shape according to the limbs and joints: as was previously mentioned from the types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cauterizing iron with flour of herb mixed with honey and other cure until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is swollen and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the swollen limb with cauteries according to the size or condition of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the skin's thickness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterize for a certain swelling that occurs in the hand and foot, on the spine at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the swelling is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not presume over it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	§ On the method of cauterizing in Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Chapter 61.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is discolored, and nothing is applied to it from the resources of medicine: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of Arnoglossa, and blood of dove, and blood of goose: let each be a part of one: mix all these, and apply them to the cloth, and stick to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	§ On the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 62.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you want to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise say, that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	To me, however, it does not appear that way: for I fear lest it should suppurate; and I have seen that very thing several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is more proper to cauterize around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cautery irons.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Of the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When a person has Adubelati, and the maturation is delayed, either because of excessive discharge which he makes, or because of old age, when he is weak with few drops of blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cautery irons by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to make a perforation of it with a cautery iron, then use the cautery iron, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery iron be weak, so that the course of the purging may be eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Of the method of cauterizing in a corrosive ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive ulcer is not other than a corruption in a moving member, and it corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive ulcer in a place which would bear a cautery iron with fire, then use many cautery irons, small and large, according to what is suitable for that place where the corrosive ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all parts until the whole corruption is destroyed, and nothing remains of it entirely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let him rest for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas ground sulfur mixed with oil until all the scars and corruption are removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with flesh-generating ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If you see that after three days the flesh grows back healthy, without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on what remains from the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And he should be rubbed with sharp medicine at times.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cauterization with fire is faster for healing: and indeed I have already said about its cauterization with sharp medicine in division; so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in Warts, and Clavi.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Frequently it happens in the lower parts of the feet this illness: and it is a rough, dripping matter that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed cauterization in them is according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However much with fire is, so that the cauterization tool is sharp like a penfeather: which should be made of iron, according to the amount it contains the wart from all parts: and it should be thin at the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place him on fire over the wart.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn his hand with the cauterization tool around the wart, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the wart: and let him rest for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plasters to him with sharp-smelling ones, crushed with salt: and let the plaster be applied over him at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	He will be uprooted from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a generative flesh ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not convergent and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply heat to them with hot water: and take a needle from air, or iron, or from the feather of a turkey: and place it on the clauum, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then apply a small amount of hot water to the needle: hold your hand and turn it with slight compression of your hand, so that the edge of the needle is imprinted on the clauum root, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the clauum: and wait for the weak one for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let him go, for the clauum is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with them one by one, until you come across all those who are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are uprooted, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	ON THE METHOD OF CAUTERIZING IN TREMOR.
Caput LVI.	CHAPTER 66
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that tremor occurs from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from another: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four or five cautery irons on the spines of his back, and between every spine with a cautery, and in his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor is quieted with the olive oil cautery, and hastens the health of the cold sick person.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	ON THE METHOD OF CAUTERIZING ALBATHIR.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	At times, abscesses, that is, boils, which are formed from corrupted coarse materials, are expelled from the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, they must be cauterized over the entire head of the boil with a fine cautery made from the wood of the myrtle tree, whose end is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of the long-leaved aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase: and the excess is broken, which makes them, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery into a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Frequently it happens that the flow of blood from an artery which is cut at the wound, which happens outside, or at the incision of the pustule, or cauterizing the limb, and similar to them: and it is difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when it happens to someone, then quickly with your hand at the mouth of the artery, and put on top of your finger: and press it much, until the blood is held back by your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put a small cautery of olive oil and many: and blow on them, until they are burned greatly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a little, or much, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and put the cautery on the vein, after you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery, until the blood is cut.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the thorn is expelled from the orifice of the artery and the burning iron is extinguished, then take another burning iron quickly from the prepared ones in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood stops flowing.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerves which are there, and another misfortune occurs on the weak one.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is impossible to remove it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a burning iron, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is removed, the ends of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they are placed on it medicines of their property, which is to cut off the blood and tie it with a proper compression.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who administers its cutting with a ligature and binding with a cloth, and position of things burning and similar, does not give it to him completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it happens to anyone of that, and he is not present to him the physician nor the medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger over the orifice of the vein itself, as we said, and compression of it very, until oppressed by the blood from the upper part of the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, above it with cold water of intense cold always, until the blood freezes, and swells, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile consider in it what is needed from the burning iron, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Chapter on Incision, Puncture, and Bloodletting in Wounds and Similar Conditions
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already mentioned in Chapter One, all illness that is suitable for the application of fire and burning medicine, and its causes, reasons, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I proceed in this chapter the same way: so that it may alleviate those who are seeking and have found it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn this, son, which is in this chapter from the fear of that which is in Chapter One about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that reason, it is necessary to have greater caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, often feces and blood fall out together, with which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of the exit, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and all similar things: from all of these, fear, trembling, and death fall in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to fall into that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes such men and their ways of infirmity come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and is light-hearted about death: because of the vehemence of him which he found from his infirmity and length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	Among them is one who gives his lute to you, and gives you along with it, hoping for health, but his illness is dangerous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more urgent than his greed and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from him unless after certain knowledge that confirms to you the succession of praiseworthy.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use them in the healing of all your sick, for the prediction and indication of what is fitting for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him you have help for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, His understanding, and may He not take from you direction and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the previous chapter of Cauterization, from the head to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek from him and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the healing of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often happens to children among those who are born: or when the midwife tightly holds the head of the child without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens even for an unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this illness in other than children: and to all of whom I saw from them, death came quickly: therefore it seemed to me to leave the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	I myself have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head was admired every day until he could no longer sit on himself due to the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone above the skull.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation for this, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and it is a small abscess, then it must be cut in the middle of the head: and the length of the fissure should be about two knots, until the moisture is drained.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a syringe.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two fissures according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the cuts of the head open from all sides: and water is pressed when you press it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you this: then it must be cut in the middle of the head with three fissures, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tie the fissures with cloths and cotton.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply this from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligament, and care for the wound with compresses, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not dismiss tying the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes there is more in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Then ascend with an incision where you see the abscess and swelling of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not cut the artery, and the blood flow occurs, and the weak person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ On the incision of the arteries that are after the ears.
Caput II.	2nd Head.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrh occurs to someone's eyes or chest, and it is not cured by medical treatment: then the last cure is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you want to cut them, it should be done so that the weak person's head is relieved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then tie the weak person's neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are locations that are below the ears: and it is rarely hidden, unless in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a hot iron on both: and cut both with a narrow blade, the incision going to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you want, insert a narrow blade under the artery, and cut it to the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the pulse is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the inside frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the quantity of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then indicate with a hot iron and fennel, and scrape up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be expelled from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you may expel more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the amount that appears to you from the weakness and filling of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains to the bone from the scab something, then cut that, so that it does not happen hot abscess: then bind the wound with lints from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has ancient headaches or sharp cataracts due to acidic humors and heat in the temples, or old soda, strong, and similar to those: and he is treated with remedies of cure and not given that: then we have experienced these pains in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have said.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in the extraction of them is, that the weak hair which are in the temples be scraped off, and he directs to the artery that appears in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few men, or vehemence of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then he binds his weak head with any of his cloths: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water, until it appears to you with clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a small needle, which I have previously formed.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then, remove the skin along with the fascia until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert the hook into it and pull it out towards the top until you remove it from the skin and make it extend through the layers of tissue beneath it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then cover it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the amount by which their ends extend and contract, so that blood loss does not occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood will not rise at all.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then wash out the blood with six ounces of water, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with strong double silk thread or with catgut, so that it does not hasten to putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and blood loss occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizing iron and a scalpel until its ends are cut and it remains in the same position of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to do this unless if the patient is weak and has a fever or a heated constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cauterizing iron is from those things that dry up moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to use a moistening agent.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, to fill the place with old wheat flour and place some well-made cotton on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound is cleaned with dry medicaments that cause flesh to grow and with lotions, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, while you are operating, blood suddenly flows from the artery, then quickly remove it with a cautery, or fill the place with zeugit: and press your hand until the blood stops flowing.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If there is nothing present for you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And apply cold water to the spot until the burning stops and it is bandaged as appropriate.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it has a cautery with two knives: and the sharpness of the two knives should be like molten wax.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as two knives, both cool quickly and do not cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	However, since there is a little thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore it is better for all work, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be space between the two knives equal to the thickness of a finger, after you mark two spots with the cauterizer: and place both hot ones, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that it is extended between its ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate completely with this cauterizer.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cauterizer.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the care of the course of sharp, frequent tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are frequent and their course is from the eyes, which are on the outside of the skull above: and nothing is applied to them with medicine, and you see that the face of the sick person is already red, and feels a kind of walking, like the walking of ants: and his eyes are thinned, wet, so that the hairs of his eyebrows are already corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are hot from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in the cure of these operations, and called it a cure, with a Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	You should command the sick person to shave off the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then you should make three evenly spaced cuts across the forehead according to its length: and let the length of the cut be about two fingers, and let one cut be evenly spaced from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length slightly beyond the shoulder blades, and the third on the other side: and beware of incising the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the entire length of the incision be the amount of three fingers joined together: and let there be a piece of prepared sponge or dry cloth with which to stop the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert two sharp-pointed needles, whose following form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the flap that is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove that spatula and insert another tool, called a sharp cultello, from one side gently, not sharply from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh with the skin, and its gentle side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle cut: and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle cut up to another cut.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after the blood has flowed out an equal quantity, express the locations from the pieces of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linen soaked in old cooked linseed in every wound, and place over them lints moistened with wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And be sure that no abscess of heat occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the bandage, and administer an infusion much with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and with the other things that heal wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the care of sharp tears and catarrh from the inside of the head to the eyes.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When catarrh occurs to someone sharp, sharp, and frequent: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already weakened is their aspect: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and they fall out from them, and in the deep of the head is sharp pain, hurting, and following sneeze: then take from these accidents that those matters, and catarrh do not come, except from many vents.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better cure in them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you order the sick to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in that wound one in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly in width, and begin with the wound from the left temple to the right: and it is incision until the bone: and lengthen your hand away from the temple bones, which move at mastication: until when the bone is exposed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between two lips of the wound with old cooked linen, or with lints of flax.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie above with wool: and drink wool soaked in wine and oil, so that no heat abscess may occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you untie it, and see that the heat abscess is about to diminish: then it is necessary to rub the mouth, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a dry diet that causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch: and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it at the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ On the care of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or a stone similar to it, such as iron and copper: or it is a plant, such as beans and peas: or it is a fluid, such as water, and vinegar, and the like: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone, or a kind of stone from those which do not add nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear alone: if then you see the stone, then pour something from broken oil, or sisamin into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with the conditioned, and close the nose with an onion at the approach of sneezing, after you place in the circumference of the ear fragments of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear to the superior.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Often it exits with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not exit, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, fine pizzarolis: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it exits with Gesti, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform an extraction of it with a blind hook of fine, slight duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not exit through that, then make a cannula from air, and insert the end of the cannula into the ear canal a lot, and apply oil with softened wax around the cannula to prevent air from entering except through the cannula: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often exits with what we mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if it does not exit in this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from usco, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have put on it a cloth properly positioned: then insert it into the ear canal when you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it does not exit with all that we mentioned, then hasten to cut it before an abscess or hot fever, or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that a weak phlebotomist should be placed in the first place in the cephalic vein: and extract it from him according to the measure of its power.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the upper part, and find a small incision in the root of the ear at the fatty part of him in the depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent moon until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible from your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew the incision from your hour with speed and care until he is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then perform an extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it still does not obey you at the end, then take a thin, delicate spatula in this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the separation of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do it when you think that that grain is already moistened by the steam of the ear, until you place many fragments: then remove them with hooks, or with a fine instrument, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary to use an infirm sneezing with the first condition: and now it has filled its own ear with some cooked old [grain]: and it is lying on that ear, in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, soft, and heat them with fire for a while, and let the infirm one insert one of them into the hole of its ear: and salt on one of his feet from that part, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Do not therefore cease doing it with the stone and the stone, until all the water exits.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water exits thus, that you take from the pus, or from the dung one, and insert its end one into the ear: and heat its other end with fire, until it is burned much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the dung another one, and do it many times, until all the water exits: and remove it with a tube according to that which was prescribed in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of the animal entering into it, if it is small of body, such as a flea, and similar to that, take care of him as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	If it is a large body part that is visible to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, when you extract the worms generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we mentioned in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not bring about cure: then you should look at the ear in the sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from the worms, then remove it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there from the worms, then take a cannula, whose form is narrow below and wide above: and insert its fine tip into the ear according to the amount that the weak person can tolerate: then suck with it strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to the end, then wrap a woolen cloth around the cannula with clay, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with that, then administer the distillations which the ancients have been acquainted with in the puncturing of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be what you pour out oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver, or from brass, below narrow, in which there is a small hole, above wide.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let the thing that is in the hollow of the cannula be made from brass properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radium, and wrap it in a proper fold of cotton at the end of it: then project oil, or suck, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the radium with the cotton above, and press it with your tempered hand compression until the oil is forced into the hollow of the ear, and the weak person feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed with a little fire: and beware that there is nothing that is distilled into it very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Translation: On the Care of Accidental Burns from Gold.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes, infants occasionally emerge from their mother's wombs without being pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that burning occurs in the ear canal from a wound, or from flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this burning sometimes occurs in the deep canal of the ear, which does not reach sight: and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the canal, and reaches sight.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which happens in the deep ear, and which does not include sight, is difficult to cure in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows sight, it is necessary to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look at it: then if you see the burning appearing, open it with a thin, subtle probe, whose form is as follows: its end is small, and has a small width; and the rest of the probe is flat on both sides: so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the burning is born from flesh in the ear canal: then hold it with a thin, sharp instrument, and cut it with great force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the burning is in the deep ear: then take a thin, sharp, and heated probe with a little fire: then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the burning with that which the sick person has, if he experiences great difficulty in hearing, try to open it with force: and beware, do not wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a liniment according to the size of the canal, which you have unfolded in Egyptian oil: make it for several days, until you are secure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take linseed and infuse it in rosewater, then sprinkle powdered zegi on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see an ear already suppurating, then it is necessary to remove the linseed, and let it be placed with another linen cloth that has been rolled in oil made with rosewater, until the boil becomes hot: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if blood is flowing, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment that stops the predicted bleeding in the aforementioned treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the care of Althea's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelia which occur in the eyelids of the eye, sometimes are moist and sometimes are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers: or with an uncinus, and cut them off from their roots with a lancet.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zegi on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cauterizer.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when there remains something from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the care of Granatum's eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something occurs in the eyelids that resembles the strength and hardness of Granatum, and because of this it is called Grando: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for these is thus: consider if it is a frost (a cold sore) proceeding from that which appears from the eyelid, and moves to all parts, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find therefore above it a fissure of width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from all parts with facility, until it subsides.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a splint, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cutting off of it is not prepared for you, unless when you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then it harms the weak one in some place.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the fissure is large: then gather it with a suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For an ointment restores it, and flesh it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the frost is declining towards the interior of the ear, turned away from the inner surface, then turn the eyelid, and suspend the frost with a splint: besides which you need an incision, and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it does not harm it in some place.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the frost, with salted water: and care for the place with that which fleshes it, until the weak one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ About the care of Axiromath for the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat which is generated in the tunics of the upper eyelid: and much indeed happens to it in children: and it blurs their eyes, and cataracts happen to them in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because their tears rush to them, and on account of this you see them lying on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are under wet arches, which inflation has already covered: and the eminence of Axirnath appears to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of operation is for the sick person to place his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a poultice in it, and make from it a circle of the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him on it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a thin blade making incisions along the width, and let there not be an incision larger than that which is made in bloodletting in the depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make an incision in the whole skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for the Axirnath proceeds from the incision in many ways according to the shape of a white fat fragment.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it therefore with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers to the outsides: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is spread: and beware, do not add in the incision, so that the blade does not reach with the thin blade to the eye, and you wound him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you will add a little with ease into the incision, until the Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind him with poultices.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some men who sprinkle salt on it, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture is melted.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an abscess occurs in the place of heat, then care for him with sedative plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of Ataxmir's eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and the eye waters excessively, causing it to water incorrectly.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional eyelashes grow in the eyelids beyond their usual course and become ingrown: then they harm the eye, causing various afflictions such as frequent tears, eyelid softening, and sclera, leading to the cause of eye destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed cures the eye in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or by incision and sutures.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannulas, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, then it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not, then insert the needle into the one where the hair is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with thread from above, and be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread to the upper part with the eyelid, and turn it with a spoon.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a thin probe entering from the larger lacrimal duct up to the smaller lacrimal duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and place a small amount of charcoal or cloth under the eyelid: then mark on the eyelid with cauterizing iron, which is like the shape of myrtle leaves.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary to make the figure according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid, since this varies among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For some, it is necessary for the figure to extend beyond the eyelid due to the large quantity that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the spatula, draw a line above two lines that you have marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal to the smaller one, and let there be a fissure near the natural hairs, like the size of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the entire scale.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine thread of wool: and wipe off the blood, and make that which is superfluous from the threads over the two eyebrows stick to it, with some things that prevent it from unraveling, if you wish to do so; and if not, you will not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and thread for three days or four, and then take care of it afterwards.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and take care of it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the sign of the wound and its gathering, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of healing Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is anxiety over the weak one, and it is from good surgery, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is also taught by Ataxmir: and it is to make signs on the eyelid in the form of a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate or gathered hooks, according to this following form, and then cut off what is superfluous with small forceps, according to this form, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the shape: and insert another thread near the tear duct, larger, and another thread near the tear duct, smaller: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand evenly by elevation: and lift the skin over which is marked with ink, as we have told you.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather two wound lips with suture: and care for it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess occurs near your incision, or your wound: then soothe the abscess with charcoal, and these similar things, from ointments that settle.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore you should use what we said in the incision: but the suture on both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ On the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND IT IS, that you turn the eyelid, and tear the wound that is inside, as I have told you.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two splints, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a finger: and you have already cut on the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather each of them with thinness on top of what exceeds from the eyelid of the eye, and tie two splints from both sides with a strong suture, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin tight will die, and blacken, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it delays, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is consolidated, raise the eyelid: and do not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two needles that you will make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	About raising hairs that prick in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, to take a thin needle and insert it into the hair with a fine silk thread, gentle.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends and tie both knots with a very fine silk thread: and the length of the threads should be one finger.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose another fine silk thread under it in a short space, and tie the ends of it if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the weak head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be shown: because it is a delicate or small operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the silk thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out from above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to above the silk thread: and insert that hair into the silk thread: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the silk thread into the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the silk thread is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: pull the silk thread downwards, with the thread that you composed in it, until the silk thread comes out from the upper opening, and see it with the vision of the eye: then pull the silk thread and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and let it be closed for two days, or three, until the hair sticks in its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then associate it with a longer hair from natural hairs, and lift it with that: or let it be, until it lengthens after some time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the care of Alexander that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alexander's eye occurs, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alexander's eye is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore it is accidental from the consolidation of a wound, or cutting, or cauterization, and similar to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and that you put in it what is between them linen from linen, and bandage it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use in the cure of things that dry and contract: for if you do this, Alexander's eye returns worse than it was: rather use in it those things that soften, such as fenugreek: and rub with water in which althea has been cooked, seed linen: and ointment dyaquilon, which has been melted with some oil: and wrap with it linen, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of cure is that you try with every skill, that it not consolidate, according to the form that it was in first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we said is indeed only some correction of Alexander, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the care of Alexander that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is what is done below, which is truly called Albucasis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you dip it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad-bladed knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is proper, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radium, and put it in the tear, and turn with it the eyelid: and make two tears on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two tears be from two corners of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they gather together, this figure is made, and it is the Greek letter laud.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount, which is the sharp side of its width below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separate parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said, with softening medicines, and lotions, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Albucasis happens from a tear and a stitch, or a cauterization: then it is necessary to make the tear flat under the eyelashes, even as it preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with a ligature, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech about the care of Albucasis, whether it is above or below, is that he should operate on it according to the operation prepared from the form of Albucasis.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed it is of many diverse forms: and the skilled artisan prepares his skill with whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or near to it, and himself the infirm one, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whites of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you must insert the end of the ray under the eyelid, and raise it up: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a thin, small knife, which is not with the sharpness of the knives, but is blunt for a little: so that the infirm one may not be disturbed by the operation, and the knife may not injure the eye with its sharpness: and your incision will be as if you are scraping off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour in the eye salt water, with water to clean it: or sprinkle in it from a sponge made of zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a ligature line: and place on the eye a soaked cloth with egg white: and after three days use a sponge, and with firm things, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the Incision of the Claw and Prominence of Flesh for Tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the claw is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard, thin string.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture of white: which when it touches the iron flame, or you try to take it with the hook, it is cut off, and does not stick on it the hook.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin, except from the larger tear-duct, until it gradually reaches, so that it covers the sight, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that you put your weak head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the claw with a hook of few multiplications, and extend it to the upper parts.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert in it a needle from the needles of horses, or oxen, or goose: and let it be strong, and double the tip of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the claw: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the claw with thread, and extend it to the upper parts: and scrape off the side of the claw that follows the pupil, as if you hold it with the thread until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut off the remainder at the root of the tear-duct with a thin, sharp knife, or with small forceps: and let go the natural flesh of the tear-duct, so that it may not happen from its incision that the course of tears is constant.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with a hook alone: or with thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then, he shaves with a mild exfoliant, whose shape is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the exfoliant touch the horn-like skin of the eyelid and cause a tear, and perforate the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put something salty and crushed into the eye, or made from sieving sewage, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the eyelid is not nervous, and you cannot insert an awl into it nor fix a hook in it, then this kind of eyelid is often treated with medicines and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a thin, mild, weak exfoliant, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the eyelid from above with the same thinness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is rarefied and broken, and you press on it, then pour from your hourglass into the eye a liquid made from sieving sewage, or from sieving red, or crushed salt: and keep the eye closed until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the opposite is true in your eye, a hot abscess: then leave it, and care for the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with the razor, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the elevation of the eyelid causes harm to the eye with great injury, it is suspended with a hook, and cut from that part: and do not complete the incision, so that the course of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then, pour some rubbed red stone, or that made from azurite, into the lachrymal until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of Al-Guardian, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes flesh is born in certain human eyes, composed or placed with red, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or stretches over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids to the outside: and it resembles a balmrose rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in it is also that he places his weak head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with the appropriate hooks to that: and hold it with a wrench, or a hook.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh in the first place, until it is all of his with the incisor.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not wound it in the operation: and your incision is what you cut it with, or with a small spatula, which we mentioned in the incision of the hoof: or with small forceps, with which it is gathered, according to the form it will have after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	Then when your incision is completed, and the whole Al-Guardian is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or pour in it red powder, and similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place on the deformed eye a bandage with egg white: so that it is secured from hot suppuration.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains any of Al-Guardian, and hot blood rules you, and you fear hot suppuration: then let go the eye, and care for it with that which calms the suppuration.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	Similarly, perform with added flesh that occurs in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to operate on all weak eyes from the natural or accidental way with iron: and you should not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ On collecting sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that cover the eye and prevent their operation: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you to first consider whether the eye in which there is sebel is strong, and there is no other illness in it except sebel: then collect sebel from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you command the weak one, that he put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with a needle one or two according to your prudence: and the needle should be thin for the formation of the stitches, in this form, or there are two needles gradually in one body, in this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with thin forceps with thinness, and remove the blood hour by hour, until you see that those veins are removed from the eye, and they dissolve: and beware not to injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And your operation should be in midday before the sun, and you should be strong in your operation greatly: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have filled it, then pour green or red wine into the eye: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains from sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply plasters to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and let him rest for several days until the pain settles: and secure it from hot abscess: and then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of Aries (the nose) to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The doctors call Aries (the nose) a fistula, which they cure with a cauterizer or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what was previously reported about it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it: unless you find the abscess at its birthplace and remove all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the nose is cleaned.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the nose is cleaned and you see decay or discoloration in it, then shave it with an instrument of this form.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the rough head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and its head round like an azir, which is dotted with a file or with a fine puncturing of the aliskilfer: and put it on top of the rotten bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand on it for a while until you know that that decay is now scraped off: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dry hemostatic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place consolidates and flesh grows in it and the course of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days and does not renew, and does not form an abscess, and nothing bad happens to it: then you know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it: unless you reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape off the bone second with iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take the drill according to this form, its end is iron, triangular: and the wood of it is a flattened pyramid until its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the eye itself: and let it be near the lacrimal point: and lengthen your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the trephine until it enters the eye, and feels it to be weak: by which, as it finds the wind coming out of it, when it holds its hand on its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent healing medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is born and the place hardens: then the matter that flowed to the outsides returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On the Reduction of the Prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its whole, and no harm occurs in the sight, nor diminution: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak: then you must bleed him: afterwards place windy ones in the temples without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment on the eye which is made of acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster with many pledgets.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the pledgets is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth on top of four: make many from them: then place them one over another according to the amount that the eye needs: then bind them with a hard cloth and a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat windy ones with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the windy ones, and let the eye loose day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage again becomes soft, then it is necessary to bind much: then remove the bandage day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see the eye about to return to its original position, it is good; but if not, then repeat the ointment, bandages, and splints, and the windy [treatment], until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Of incision of the eye's membrane.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a tear occurs in the eye's membrane, it then protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and defaces the form of man due to this, and you wish to cut it: then the operation on him is as follows: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the lacrimal gland, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with that part of the eye in the circumference of the needle: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place a soaked wool above the eye on the white of the eye: and release him, until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with him, that it strengthens him, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is tied up with a bandage from all parts with a circle of cloth, until the eye gains a great elevation.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then pierce it with a thin lancet, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and cleanses the humidity of the white of the eye, and the eye descends, and goes in immediately: then tie him, until he heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Of the treatment of almonds.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness which is called almond, is not, unless it is pus, which gathers in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation in this is, that you make the disabled person sit on a prepared seat, or a straight one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from the two sides, and move it, until you see health reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then shape it, and let it not descend, and let the light be completed: and the disabled person will see as he used to: and if it does not descend lower, you will know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the preparation of the descent of health does not come with what we said, then make the disabled person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin lancet, and prick with it above the corneal skin a little at the continuation of the joined part with the corneal tunic to the corona, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or water in which you already boiled fennel and honey: then let it be treated with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	¶ On the care of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have already mentioned the appearance of water in division, and what is appropriate for cutting with speech declaring and explaining, then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore you must make the disabled person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind the healthy eye, and pull it very tight: then open the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is water is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand alumgum, if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the needle near the corona at the thickened part of the radius appearing in the whiteness of the eye's lachrymal: then push the needle with force, and you will turn it back with your hand until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and feel that the needle has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it should be the measure of the path of the needle to the depth, the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and it is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see them in the pupil itself of the eye, because of the clarity of the tunic of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle until it reaches the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downward, one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water comes down immediately, then the sick person sees that above which he opens his eye immediately, and the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water comes down, then lay it down in the second place, except that the needle goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it sticks, and does not rise: then take out the needle with ease: and you will turn back your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something clear from the salt of jewelry in water: and wash with it the eye inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye all the bandage, or woven cloth dyed with rose oil, and with sclera of eye: and tie it with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place on him ground almond with sclera of eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the needle does not obey you for entering into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a person whose eye is very hard: then you must take a small tool, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, connect it with that joint only and do not insert your hand through the opening: and it is only so that you may make a way to the delicate spot of the womb.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the sponge, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for him a decently made bed of rest, in which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and let him be prevented from all movements, and from coughing: and place his food, that which nature leni
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its condition up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark room, and examine his sight: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do it at the hour of cure, or immediately after incision: but rather that others do it: because water ascends quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens to be a hot abscess: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh: and correct it with that which sedates the abscess, until it is sedated: then complete his sight, and place on his face an oral remedy by which his sight is regulated for several days, while he is still in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should go out of the house gradually, and return to his usual activities.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you should know that in the case of a student, vision is not excused from zaltea: for then he dares to perform operations.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, one of those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that it happened in Alayrach that a man was perforated, through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	I have not seen anyone in our land who has done this: nor have I read it in any book of the ancients; and it is possible that it may be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from which it stands above those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They should be made of air properly: and their ends should be with the same subtlety of a triangle, and a sharp end.
Formae magda.	Forms of the great.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes flesh is born in the nose that is added with various kinds, of which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from this is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of a dark color: and from this is the flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that therefore which is from those flesh that is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to do this: sit the weak in your hands opposite to the sun, and open his nose, and thrust a hook into those flesh: then draw them out to the exterior, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin sharp knife on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remained from which its removal is not possible: then shave it with one of the tools with facility, until there is nothing remaining from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however blood dominates you, or hot abscess happens to you: then apply to him what is necessary: or it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten cauterizing him, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then throw into the nose after incision vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you will know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is flesh born within him in the upper parts of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you should insert a string with some bulk and many knots in it: and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less: and make him bend his weak hand, so that he sends one end of the string into his nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has made it similar to an azzer: and draw out his smell, until it reaches the throat, and comes out over his neck.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And they often do something similar to this of Attoumi boys in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the string: one that comes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then the flesh with the knots that are on the string should be cut off.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the string.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the string: and put it into his nose after washing away the blood: with the linen that you soaked in the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the matter into his nose a lead tube, for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however he needs the cure that will dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To perform the extraction of a tooth, when drops of olive oil and other medicines are applied to the nose, do this with silver or bronze: it should be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for tooth extraction should be full, empty: with a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil or whatever you wish to extract from flexible substances and things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart grows at the end of the nose, and it becomes prominent and increases with the days, until it becomes disgusting in appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to cut off that at the beginning of its appearance, and uproot all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the spot, or a cauterizing iron, or a burning medicine that remains in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting of it is delayed until it becomes prominent, then consider if it is stone-like, hard, dark in color, few sensations: then do not touch it with iron: because it is an abscess that is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often I have seen people who cut into an abscess, and harm came to them from it great evil upon him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is gentle to touch, not dark in color, and you see that cutting it all is possible, then evacuate the weak one, and cut it without fear, without pity: and care for the spot with what dries and contracts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the closure of the nose, lips, and ear:
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, it does not greatly benefit from an operation, except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from this, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather the edges of the wound with sutures, and then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the disruption of continuity has already separated the lips, and each part is healthy: then you should scrape off all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather two lips with sutures, and tie them, and powder the dragon's blood on top of the blood, and ground frankincense: and place above the powders a fragment of the plaster diafinicon, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medication: and leave it until the sutures come off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suture is to gather the disruption of continuity, or with a needle, as we have told you about the suture of the stomach: or gather it with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Regarding the removal of warts on the lips:
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed have warts often on the inner parts of their lips, which are hard and similar to grains of herbs: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should turn the lip, and scrape over every wart of it, and hang it with a needle, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the space after incision with zeig crushed until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply a mixture of vinegar and honey to the wound, and dress it with a stiptic substance until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	About making an incision on the flesh of the thigh over the knee joint.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows on the knee joint, which the ancients called abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should hang it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus run out, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the wound zeig crushed, or other stiptic and dry powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after healing, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	About the reason of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the jaws rough, foul, and sometimes turn yellow and green, until that corruption reaches the jaw, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should make the weak one sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and shave the molar and tooth, in which the roughness and sand-like substance appear to you: until nothing remains from them, and similarly do with blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the razor on them on another day, second, and third, until you reach the end of your desire in it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth requires razors of various shapes and many forms: according to how it is prepared for your operation; because the razor with which it is removed from the lower part of the tooth is different from the razor with which it is removed between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And those forms of razors should be prepared by you, as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and slowly remove it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it does not fit its place when it is removed: because it is a subtle substance; until there is no excuse for its removal, then when the sick person must remove it himself, to strengthen and be certain about the tooth that causes pain.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and removes it; then the pain does not go away, until the weak tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the tooth that causes pain is removed by himself, then you should scarify around the tooth with a small knife, in which there is something of its virtue, until the gum is separated from all parts; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in that location with good position, and the head of the sick person between your knees; which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all parts with ease, and try its movement, as you did in the first place.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill the hole with a cloth: and to tie it with the thin end of a finger, so that it does not break during your constriction with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to carefully perform the incision around the jaw from all sides, much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and its part remains, and it returns to the weaker one from that greater malice which is its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, so that you do not do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and the audacity of them over its extraction, besides which they administer what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great harm to people, whose difficulties are such that they break them, and all their roots remain, or some of them: or that they extract it with certain jawbones: as we have often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be covered after its extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	Which if there is bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then wipe some zege with it, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not give you zege.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the fine forceps by which the tooth is moved in the first place, should be long at the ends, short in the handle, thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth: they should be like the thick handles, until when you tie with them, they do not bite themselves, nor double: short at the ends, and made from iron, or from a well-made file, straight ends: and in their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and tie with a proper constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes such ends occur like the form of a bird's beak, which is called a stork, and they are strong in their contraction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the Removal of Teeth, and Extraction of the Jawbones' Bicuspids.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains at the removal of a tooth that is broken, then it is necessary to place butter on the spot for one or two days, until the spot becomes soft: then introduce into it algasti, or forceps: whose ends resemble the beak of a bird, which is called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	However, this is the form of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file inside: or like an algasti.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you with these forceps, then it is necessary to make an incision on the root, and tear away all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small pincer, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in its end, rather thick: and not wetted, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root exits through that, it is good: and if not, you must wriggle with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular end, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the thin triangular end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also wriggle with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also wriggle with this instrument that resembles a large hook, whose form is this: a twisted triangular end, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and it is not wetted.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many dental instruments: and similarly, the other tools are not counted, and a wise craftsman, skilled in his art, has found for himself alone the tool, according to what signifies to him the operation and the very pains themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For since from the pains to which they did not say the tool, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jawbone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then to examine above it in its place with that which suits him from the tools and forceps that I said in extraction of root, and to heal with the gesture whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of bulk gradually, so that it is tied or held with the jawbone, and does not flee and run away, until the jawbone comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines to that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small rot in the bone, then shave it from its own rot, and heal it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the cutting of teeth projecting above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not project above others according to their natural course, it becomes disfigured by that form: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, that is, those who are marriageable.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth, and does not fit, or is possible to cut it, nor to shave it: then eradicate it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of iron, with very sharp extremities.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be where you incise on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another is not moved by the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed, then it is filed with its own file, which has this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of india, and its handle is made of fine points, like a needle with which needles are made: with which tooth is filed gradually on many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved, and it falls: then smooth it, at the end shave it with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if it is a tooth from which part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary that the file even that, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is equal: and it is flattened, and it does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	¶ On the filing of teeth with gold files.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens to the front teeth that they are shaken and moved by a blow, or by chance: and the weak one cannot string over that which he eats so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with hemostatic remedies, and the cure did not improve: then the skill in them is, that they are strung with gold wire: because silver becomes green, and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium thinness and thickness according to the amount that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of the filing is indeed, that you take the wire, and insert a double of it between two healthy teeth: then weave with the two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one is, or more, until you reach with the net to the tooth of the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texturing until you reach the part where you started: and tie your hand with skill and wisdom, until it is completely removed: and your binding should be like tying a thread, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the thread with forceps: and gather both, and fold them with a hook: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so that it does not hurt the tongue: then let it be released as tightly as possible while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is loosened or cut, tie them with another thread, and it will stand with it in this way for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the shape of the binding of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two return to their places after the fall of both, and they are retained as we have said, and remain: and this is not done by anyone other than a skilled and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes something is taken from the cow's bones: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in the place from which the tooth is protected and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and it is served with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	¶ About the cutting of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in it is, that you open the mouth of the sick person in his neck, and raise his tongue: then cut that nervous ligament in width, until the tongue is released from its binding.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is due to the consolidation of the wound: then push a hook into it, and cut it across its width until you sever the ligament, and the knotting will be dissolved.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a deep cut into the flesh, and you sever an artery there, and there is a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then apply a compress to the wound with rosewater, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen rag under the tongue, which the weak person should hold all night: so that it does not consolidate again in the second day.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is a flow of blood, then apply charcoal powder on the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if the blood gushes out, then cauterize the place with a blunt cauterizer, which is suitable for that: and then care for it along with the other cure, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	About the extraction of a ranula that is formed under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small ranula, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it becomes so large, that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is, to open the mouth of the weak person in front of the sun: and examine the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see it is of a dark or black color, hard, and which the weak person does not feel: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then push a hook into it, and cut it with a thin saw, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If the blood insists on you during your surgical operation, then place some crushed zeigum on it until the blood is removed: then return to your operation until you have extracted it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then bandage it with vinegar and salt: and take care of the rest of its cure according to what is suitable for that, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of two abscesses in the tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and the glands, which resemble those of the thyroid, which occur deformed: and they are called two tonsils: which when you care for with what we said in division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, brownish color, little pain: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is reddish color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, rather leave it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it: or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white color, round, and its root is thin: then it must be pierced.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before your operation, if the abscess of it has quieted by warm completion, or it is diminished by some reduction: then therefore make the sick one sit in front of the sun, and his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let him receive a servant between his hands, and press his tongue inferior with an instrument, whose this is form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Then when you press it with him the tongue, and the abscess appears to you, and falls on it your sight: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and extract it as much as you can outside, except that you pull with it some from the clothes.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument of this form, which follows:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles forceps: however, its extremities should be cared for, so that the opening of each is directly opposite and sharp: therefore, ensure that it is made of iron or enameled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula of this form:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after cutting one almond, cut the other according to this same form of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after cutting, make the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if blood flow occurs to him, gargle with water in which boiled are the shells of almonds: or myrtle leaves, and similar to those from stiptics, until the blood flow stops: then care for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes abscesses arise in the throat other than the two almonds.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them according to what I said in the cutting of the two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I myself have already treated a woman with an abscess, which was born between her throat, which was pulling to the esophagus, few senses, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a tightly closed mouth, and had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached death, if it had remained for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they came out over two holes of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore acted quickly and fixed one of their claws.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and from it I extracted a large portion.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it was grasped from the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to the other one that protruded from the nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed a claw in the pus: then I cut out part of it, and only a few drops of blood flowed from it: thus the throat of the woman was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not stop cutting out from that pus many times over a long period of time: and the abscess succeeded in the place where I was cutting, until it was prolonged too much and with it that one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So it stood by the addition: then I walked away from that side, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	About cutting out abscesses in the gums.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the gum, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular one: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a wound.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in division, and does not require cure: and you see that the abscess has become quiet from her, and is thin: then it is necessary to cut it out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is collected from it is round, and there is no length to it, and it is bloody, or of a yellowish-brown color, or black, and there is no sense in it: then it is necessary to make an incision into its opening.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	In that case, there is fear of the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the method that I mentioned from its whiteness and length, you should make the weak one sit facing the sun: and press its tongue with the instrument of which I previously spoke, then fasten a hook in the throat, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you injure voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we mentioned in the incision of two tonsils: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the weak one is frightened by the incision, then you must use your skill in its cauterization without fear and cowardice.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the weak one in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press its tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I told you in the chapter of cauterization, and mix it with hot ash, and place it not thick nor subtle, and fill the hollow of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let its end be in which the medicine is placed, concavity, as the concavity of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the very same hook: and the weak one should be lying on its side, so that salt comes out of its mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to the throat of itself and injures it.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it to the first part of the wound, in the amount of half an hour, until you see that it is already dissipated and soothed by the medicine's bite.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a probe, and wrap it around the tip of the finger, and pour the probe with the medicine, and insert the finger with the probe into a tube from above, until the probe sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it indeed dries up and falls off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to reapply the medicine, apply it again: and after cauterization, clean around the wound with a probe immersed in butter, and wipe with what is in its surroundings from the medicine: and moisten with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it will be healed externally with an ointment, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this method of treatment is more wholesome than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also cured with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision: it is cured with smoking, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs to them: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be coated with clay properly: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which a concave instrument is placed according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or copper: and the tip, in which is the grapefruit, is inserted into the mouth of the sick person until the vapor rises to the nostril through the cannula, until the nostril becomes obscured with vapor.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat on it many times until it dries out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not make this treatment at the beginning of the formation of abscesses.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For indeed, it adds to the abscess: and you should not make it except at the decline of its hot swelling.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a cannula, and prepare in its tip a piece of cloth: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: for the cloth prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	About the removal of splinters, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or fish-spine sticks in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore you should extract what is visible on top of what falls down the throat, after pressing your tongue with an instrument under the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person may swallow a piece of bone, or the root of lettuce, or a piece of dry bread: or he may receive a piece of sponge from the sea-sponge, wet and gentle, and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the splinters, or bone, are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not exit with that which we said, then use the tool of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the Radius a little, and at its end have a narrowness which will insert into his throat with ease: and he himself should have his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of his own epiglottis, so that it does not happen to him coughing, and push with it, or a sponge, or insert it himself the doctor with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person inserts, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the thing attached: and push downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ On the extraction of the bloodsucker.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodsucker is treated with that which we said in division of cure with medicines, and does not bite, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or at the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook, or with a slender tool decently.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a hollow needle, and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to near his throat: then insert in the hollow of the needle burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and let the sick person refrain from all water on that day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him receive a full glass of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and cover his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The leech immediately drops off when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out with what we mentioned earlier, then smoke the patient with cimices, or with asafetida using the tool we mentioned in smoking the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, because it will fall off anyway.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	The method of operation in smoking is as follows: take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire: and the pot should be covered with a lid, in which there is a hole: and the instrument should be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoke, and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, until you know that the smoke has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately drop off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall off, then repeat the smoking often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient should bear thirst, and eat salted food, and ointments, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls on it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this hook which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their cutting, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abscesses are of many kinds, of many forms, according to what remembrance comes to mind, namely one and one in this book: and they differ in their piercing and cutting from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is from the species of boils that are in themselves, and that includes what it contains from moistures.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is due to the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because the boil that happens in the head is different from the boil that happens in the anus, and the boil that happens in fleshy places is different from the boil that happens in joints, and to each of them is its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the boils are those that it is not necessary for them to be punctured, unless after the maturation of the pus in them and its complement: and from them are those that it is necessary for them to be punctured while they are raw, and not mature according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Just as boils that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because the boil when it happens near the joint, and to be lasting is extended until that which is in its circumference perhaps corrupts the ligaments, or the nerve of that joint: therefore it is a reason closer to the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is the boil near the main member: because if you delay its puncture until it matures, it will harm either him, or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, puncture therefore it immature: and it is not necessary for you to puncture, the boil raw, not completed digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in the end of it that is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary for you to know the time of puncture of the boils that have matured according to the complement: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulse, and sharpness of head of the boils: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary to make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and its most prominent elevation: and the perforation should extend in the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the back, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that reflect, go with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to let go of its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filth and filthiness, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body at need: or according to that where the limb needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary for the administrator in small abscesses to make a small perforation, and in large abscesses to make a wide perforation: or many cuts according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are from abscesses, in which it is necessary to make a concavity of the skin: and it is cut when it has already been made like a garment, and it has become in the end, which is already dead: like that which happens in many, so that they doubt, and bubonibus.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that are cut with a cut having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one from which it is cut like the figure of the leaf of myrtle.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a circular incision is made, and a lunar incision: and similar to these are certain incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But for that which does not have a head, such as are the mild suppurative pustules on the surface, it is necessary to make an incision into it with a shallow or flat incision only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the pustule is large and has already collected much healthy matter, you should incise it so that you do not rush and remove all the pus at once in that hour, but rather remove some of it from there.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then leave the pustule alone until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this often gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak or feeble in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man: for the animal spirit often dissolves from the animal when the healthy matter comes out, and perhaps the weak one dies and you do not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore this chapter is to be approached with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you have incised these pustules, it is necessary to clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound is small or the incision is flat, then apply linen from flax, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the pustule is large and there are many incisions, then you should insert linen into every incision until they reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the pustule you have cut off a part of the skin, or you have concaved it around: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when a garment is sewn together, or the wool is removed from flax without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply it to him and take care of that with the ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if bleeding occurs during your surgical operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after he drinks it through the cloth: and place him on the location of the blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment and healing, and powders that I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of many pustules is full of newborns: then you must pour powders with wine, and warm oil: and place them on the locations.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the locations are meaty: then you must place powders soaked in water, and oil, or him with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when the third day will be, as we said, then you must dissolve the abscess, and cleanse him, and administer to his healing what is suitable for him, until he is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of universal healing of abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Indeed, according to the method of distinction, I have already said about every abscess, how is the way to its healing individually in chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	§ About the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Abscesses occur in the skin of the head that are small, and they are from the kinds of knots, which contain the tunics that are for them sacks: as if they were themselves washed hens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From these are the fat ones: and from these are those which contain moisture similar to lime: and from these are those which contain moisture similar to flour and porridge: and from these are similar, and from these are those which are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all, and their extraction is not fear, as long as it does not make opposition to the artery in its section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is, that you try them with an instrument, of which the form comes after these, which is called Intrumentum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that which contains moisture, then dry it with the section according to the length of the surface section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section of a line b to line g. And when the moisture is drained, then scrape the shell which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything from it entirely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For often it returns, if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian oil, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill with it the wound, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For indeed it will corrode what remains from the shell.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it the wound with Egyptian oil second and third, and if you lack it, until you trust that nothing remains from the shell, then care for the wound with oil until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fat knot: then dry it according to this form, with the section having the form of a cross: and place the needles between the grooves of the section, and scrape it from every part: and try your strength in extracting the skin which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If the artery gives you difficulty, then do as I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, if the abscess is stone-hard, treat it from the incision and cure it in the same way as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision into a stone-hard abscess is easier, since it has less blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes some of these abscesses in the head in certain people are completely without moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I have incised over an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid, hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with it when thrown, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses that occur in the head, namely those that occur in the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them is a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part of them, so that the course of the pus may be relieved towards the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is appropriate for their cure from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	¶ On the incision of Strophularias in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those that occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from each other; and every Strophulus among them is within its own tunic, as it is in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	The varieties of these Strophularia are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For among them are stones: and among them are those that contain moistures: and among them are evil ones, which do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one which you see of good disposition in touch, whose near color is to the skin, and moves to all parts, and is not annexed with the neck nerves, nor with the guidegi, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to cut it off from the upper part to the lower part of the body with a line, b. to the line, g. and scrape it from all parts: and extend two lips of the skin with a nail, or with many nails, if you need that one, as we said in head abscesses, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the precaution, that it does not cut a vein, or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let it be not very sharp: so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein, or an artery, and prohibits you from the operation, then place in the wound zeig ground, or some powders that cut blood, and bind the wound, and let it go, until the sharpness of the abscess is quieted, and the wound is softened: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut then. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger, if anything remains of the small Strophuli: therefore cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein in the root of the Strophuli: then it is necessary that you do not cut that Strophuli from its root: but it is necessary that you bind it with doubled strong thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with an old cloth that you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to gather the two lips of the wound: and suture them immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is still excess due to the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to bend the root of it and remove it: and then administer the suture that we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the Strophulas, pierce it with a shallow puncture: so that you can see its ripeness to you: and place it below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer after puncture a liniment with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains from corruption, until when you see the wound is already clean: then take care of it with a flesh-generated ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On cutting the Epiglottis from an abscess inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this cutting of the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have a synanche, it is necessary to avoid cutting the Epiglottis: because it does not allow the passage of air through it: therefore, because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both jaws, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use cutting of the Epiglottis, to avoid death from the danger that occurs from the prefocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do so, we should separate the epiglottis under three or four small circles, by cutting through its width, and in the space between two circles, by quantity, which is a section in the skin, not in the cartilage: and this location is convenient for section, as it is free from flesh, and the veins are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then he should extend the neck skin with a lancet.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he punctures the skin, until when it reaches the channel: he severs the veins, if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he severs the skin that we mentioned: and it is indicated over the section of the channel by the phlegm that escapes from it, with what is broken, and the cutting of the word.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound remain open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	Therefore, when it is removed at the hour in which fear of suffocation occurs, gather two lips of the wound skin, and suture it alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse that we mentioned is not complete, unless when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the throat of the sick person: and he was raised up, the sick person, above death, and wanted to be cut off from his breath: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person can breathe over the wound place, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered the wound to remain open, until the evil of the illness is consumed, and its duration is three days, and almost the same: then they ordered the wound to be sewn, and cured it, until he was healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I saw with my own eyes is that one maidservant took up the knife and put it into her own throat, and it struck against the part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, as is the groan of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore extracted the wound, and I found blood that had escaped from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was therefore suspicious that she had not cut her vein nor her artery: and the wind was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened and treated her wound, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant, except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned to me after days in better condition of her limbs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On cutting the hernial sac of the neck.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This tumor called hernial of the neck is a large abscess according to the color of the body: and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is of two kinds: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural kind, certainly there is no genius.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But in the accidental kind, indeed it is of two kinds: one of which is like little knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode, is like an abscess that is caused by the constriction of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary to make a presumption against it with iron, unless in that which is small: and you prove it and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a little knot, and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it off, as the knots are cut: and remove it with that which contains it from the bag, if it is in the bag: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place where what is necessary for the cure is from, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On incision over the species of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already said all the species of them in division: and it is necessary for me to tell here the difference between a node and an exit: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when an exit is hot and fever, and severe pain, until the boiling of excessive fluids, and completion of putrefaction: then the fever and heat are quiet.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But a node truly is not hot and fever, and pain, and contains them in kistis sifachin, which is their own bag, and is according to the color of the body: and is the beginning of them as chickpea, and becomes like beans, and greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either fat: or contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the cure of a node, you must try it and investigate it first with the instrument called the intromissus, according to its form which comes in the chapter that is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating the abscess and all nodes is, that you take this instrument and insert it into the moister place which you find in the abscess: and you turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscesses.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the intromissus, and consider what comes out at its tip.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, however, there is a running discharge of any color, then dry it off with a shallow cut, as I have mentioned for the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if the humidity does not run out at the point of insertion, then you know that it is fat: therefore dry it off above with a cut in the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with pins, and scrape the skin from all parts with ease: and if you can guard the kistin over it, so that you can remove it whole with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistis is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to remove it whole, often this happens, then remove it piece by piece, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if something remains of it, a little or a lot, the node returns most of all.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it pains you, and something remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp eroding powders: and bind the wound, and place above it what sits the abscess hot, and care for it with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	But if the node is large, then cut its two lips, and care for it with that which fleshens.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if the vein of the pulsatilla is contrary to you, or not pulsatilla: then hurry, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the wound rots, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to cutting that which remains of the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ Of the outer instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these are the forms of the intromissions, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these, there is a great one, and from these, there is a medium one, and from these, there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron, in the shape of a square, appropriately, so that they fit well into the opening of the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiments, and no, that is, puncturing: and one of them is called beris, that is, puncturing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from these there is a great one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are united, so that through them abscesses, and wounds, and fistulas, and boils can be investigated from what is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, clean, soft, like the large needles which have seats for them, of yellow stone, or of air, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those which are made of yellow stone.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are also made of black lead, which are united so that through them they can investigate fistulas, whose concavity is reflections, so that they reflect with their softness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from these there are long ones, from these medium ones, and from these short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of Uncinors, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from these there are simple ones, that is, which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from these there are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from these there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, by which Nodules and Abscesses are cut and scraped off: and they are of three kinds: because from them is a large, medium, and small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their ends by which the incision is made are sharp, their other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them a bandage may be applied for scraping off Nodules in fear of incision of the vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by it, and find a little tranquility from the burning which he found at excoriation of Abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magnifying Glasses, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of air, and they are like a Lens, with which is made Alcohol: and at the wide end there is a hidden Spatula point: and it runs to the insides and outsides as you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatulas which are hidden between the fingers at the puncture of Abscesses: and they do not receive them from the sick: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of Suction Cups with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of air, or yellow, round, to a certain length, as you see: and they are for delicacy.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of Suction Cups be with you both large and small: so that you cut off the blood through them quickly at need, and then when there is not present to you medicine.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But you will not use them in the cutting off of blood in every part of the body, and you will not use them except in fleshy places: as on the calves of the legs, and the hips, and the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar ones from fleshy places, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes such instruments are made of small pieces of tortoise shell, shaped like them: with which blood is drawn when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of human breasts which resemble female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the onset of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep), until they resemble female breasts: and they remain disgusting and filthy.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, if one wishes to avoid this, it is necessary for him to cover the breasts with a lunar incision, in this form from a line, b. to a line, g. Then he should scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with flesh-colored ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast leans towards the lower parts and becomes soft because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary for it to be incised on both upper sides with two similar lunar incisions, each of which contains the other at their ends, until one line contains a smaller one, in this form from a line, b. to a line, g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, he does not close the incision as it should be closed, because of the restlessness of the sick person, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary for you to fill the wound with a corrosive ointment submerged in cotton, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself until you are healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the puncturing of abscesses, which happens under the Titillus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the Titillus are of a hard species of Strophularia, which contains kists, and from them are those that contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those that are from them that contain moistures should be dried by lunar incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. And so, when all that is in the abscess is drained out of pus, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cotton is removed, and it is treated with appropriate ointment to that, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the species of Strophularia knots, then cut above it, as we said in the incision on Strophulas equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the wound extends so that it can emit pus, then apply a cauterant in it, according to what we said in it which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of abscesses that happen because of the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is ruptured and the skin that is above it is consolidated, very often an abscess occurs from this. And similarly, it happens to the vein also, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are because of the artery and vein, are: because when the abscess is because of the artery, it is long, collected in the depth of the body. And when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a noise to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	This is also for a surgical textbook, and it is talking about how a certain procedure must be done around a visible vein on the body. The Latin says: "And that which is for the vein, is round in plain sight of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision over this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and on the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great very much.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it must be avoided with iron, and what from them also is in the extremities, or in the head, must be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore over that which from them also is from inflation of the opening of the artery, find in the skin incision in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is stripped off.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between two ligaments with a lancet, until the blood that is in it all goes out, and dissolve the abscess.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for that with suitable ointments to it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess because of the incision of the vein, then it is necessary for you to hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with the same bandage as before: as I told you in the bandaging of a wound, from two sides with two ends of a strip.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the abscess throughout the incision: press and tie your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in the middle of it, until what is inside comes out: then cut off the excess skin and release what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place a piece of lint that you have dipped in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment, which is done with compresses and ointment, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ On the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess can occur in nerves: this happens in them from a blow, or from excessive work, and similar things: and it is most common in the places of supports, or calcanei, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a heavy abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it occurs in many positions without pain: and when it is tied with great force, the weak person feels in it a sensation similar to a stroke.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated abscess in the deep body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go to the front, or before, nor back to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, since it is in the joints, it should not be approached with a knife.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, if it is among them at the head or on the forehead, prick the skin with a blade.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is an abscess of small size, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off: then remove it, and cover the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the incision of abscesses that occur in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Often occur to men many times in their bellies and in the other bodies of them, tumors, which they call Mushrooms, by similarity of them with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and they are turned their lips.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is among them small: and there is among them which is greatly valued.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I indeed have seen a man, and in his belly were two tumors, which were more than other things like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, small root, and they turned their lips, and they were pricked, and moisture ran out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore pricked them, and I found in the weight of one as if X and VIII ounces and in the other as if VI ounces. And the operation in their incision is, that you consider then, if the sick is humid, and the color of the tumors is white, thin root: then prick him with a broad blade, and there be present with you cauterizing in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Often the blood is expelled from his incision much: therefore if he overcomes you with blood, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see an ailing and timid patient who is afraid of incision with a knife, then take a thread made of well-made lead and tie it around the affected part: as we mentioned earlier, and let him rest for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead thread.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not stop tying the lead thread, whenever you press on the wound, until it is cut off and falls away without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the wound is large and the root of the wound is thick, then there is a certain fear and trembling in incising it, especially in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware of not assuming to incise the wound that is of a foul color, little sensation, and ugly appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess: and I will return with a memory of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the care of the umbilical cord.
Caput LII.	Chapter 62.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The umbilical cord becomes prominent for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Either from tears in the skin, which is on the abdomen: and it goes out through it, or intestine, according to what happens in other tears.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows out of the vein, or from the artery, according to what was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the swelling that is tied up in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a tear in the skin and the outlet is thin: then it has a similar color to an abscess: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears to have a different location.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, then its location, along with what we have mentioned, is more diverse and severe.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you therefore press it with your fingers, it becomes hidden: then it returns, and perhaps it is with that sound: and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bathhouse, and it causes severe labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is mild, then it does not become hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears to be turning black from the slope.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to flesh that is born: then it is a heavy, thick, hard abscess, and it is shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to suppuration, then the touch of it is mild.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is such that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or suppuration: then it is necessary to be prevented from its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and fear, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or a mass: then it is necessary to order the sick person, as far as he can bear his breath, and stands extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then the signs with the cautery in the circumference of the navel throughout.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down supine between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then circle with a broad-bladed knife in the circumference of the navel over the place that you indicated with the cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess towards the upper parts, with a large needle.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around with a strong thread, or with a silk cord, and let the knot of the ligament be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then cut open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If indeed you find it already caught by the ligament: then remove the abscess, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly: and if you find a pus-pocket, then take it with a needle, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite is to you an artery, or vein: then encircle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which you make to pierce.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places on the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the place go until the extended flesh rots: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary from the ointments, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is from the flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with what is necessary to harden the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ On the care of CANCER (cancer).
Caput LIII.	Chapter 33.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said in the division of the species of cancer, and how is the way to its cure with medicines: and we must beware of it with the cure of it with iron, so that it does not ulcerate: and we said Cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	The ancients said that sometimes when cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, as in the breasts or thigh, and similar places, from the movable parts of the body, all of it should be removed, especially when it is just beginning to be small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But if it is old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from that, nor did I see anyone before me who reached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we said, is to go before and dissolve the weak part from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find it with manifest repletion, perform venesection on it yourself.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part with the preparation in which it will be located during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then introduce into the cancer hooks that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then hollow it out from all parts with the skin, according to probing, until there is nothing left of its roots: and let the blood run out, and do not cut it off quickly, but express the places and wipe off the thick blood entirely by your hand, or with whatever is possible there from instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the thick blood flow from the incision of the artery or vein causes difficulty for you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the Care of Hydropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 41.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have spoken about the division of the species of hydropsy, and how the collection of water is made: and the signs of all species, and their treatment with remedies.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are cured with iron are only the species of ascites alone, and it does not approach the species of tympanites: nor is the species of hydrops completely cured, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already been treated for this type of hydrocele with medications and your treatment has not been successful, then consider the following.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already been weakened by treatment and there is another ailment along with hydrocele, such as coughing or diarrhea, and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat him with iron, because there is fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see that the patient is strong and there is no other illness along with hydrocele alone, and he is neither a child nor an old person, then the method of treatment for him is to raise the sick person standing between your hands, and have a nurse behind him to press his lower abdomen with her hand, pushing water downwards.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sponge of thistle, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should be of two parts, sharp, long, and sharp at both ends like a sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should have some brevity gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation up to the intestine and damage it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydrocele is from the side of the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a cut from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards directly above the lower abdomen.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydrocele is due to illness of the liver, then your cut should be on the left side from the navel by the amount of three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of hydrocele is due to illness of the spleen, then your cut should be on the right side: and it is not necessary either that the cut be in the side where the sick person wants to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weaker place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate the skin entirely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert your hand into that incision, and scrape the skin and flesh with a spatula, as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount of skin removed be equal to the amount removed by a nail, or roughly that amount.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate the flesh until the spatula reaches the empty space: and this is the place for water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it, and insert the instrument into the hole, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or gold, which is thin and clean: at the lower part of its body there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other: and its tip is shaped like a pen, according to the shape of the incision, as you see: at the top of its body is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then the water immediately flows down onto the instrument, so you should drain off the water in the middle of the hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you drain off more than necessary from it, in an hour perhaps the weak person dies by the resolution of his animal spirit: or he suffers from syncopes which approach death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain off from it according to the amount of its virtue, and according to what the signs of the weak person indicate to you from its pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is because it should be retained immediately because the skin which retains the hole which is on the flesh: of which I have spoken, so that you can perforate it in that way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see the weak person bearing that: and also remove a small amount from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until only a small amount of water remains.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the weak, and let out a large amount of water: then cure him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait on his thirst: and cure him with dry medicines until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and epar, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have told you before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of children who are born in places where their urine is not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone of the children leaves the womb of his mother, and the head of his umbilical cord is not perforated, or is narrow, or in a different place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore one must help with the perforation of it immediately after he is born, with a fine spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the narrow opening a thin lead clamp, and tie it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to emit urine, remove it, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead, already possible is, that the urine which flows over the place, does not allow it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow, is cured with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening is in a different place, are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the virgin's hair: therefore he cannot mix to the fronts, until he raises the hair with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	This is not due to his generation, therefore, because the seed cannot reach the matrix according to rectitude: and it is a loathsome illness indeed.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	The method of treatment for him is that the weak one should be laid flat on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the girl with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut the head of the girl's hair from the place of the priapus, with a sharp knife, or a spatula with an acute point: as is the incision of a pen, or as you cut something like a root, so that the middle of it comes to the head of the girl: and that the hole fall in the middle according to what is proper.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of yourself during the operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore apply to him with that which cuts the blood, and care for the wound until he is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning white spots that occur in the prepuce and on the head of a girl, and corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These white spots often occur in a girl, and there is a disfigurement of the flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another is evil, and another is not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore the non-evil one should be suspended with a fine knife, and cut it off, until it is completely cleansed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on it a cotton soaked in Egyptian oil.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that oil after that with the oil of dyafinicon, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the white spot is evil, of foul color, then you should apply a cauterizing agent after its incision and its shaving.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, Albather is in the foreskin of a captive, not circumcised, and part of it is inside the foreskin and part outside: then it is necessary to remove Albather, which is inside first, until it consolidates, then care for it externally: because when you care for it simultaneously, the foreskin does not heal but protrudes.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now even in the testicles, and the foreskin blackness and corruption occur.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must scrape off everything that is already discolored or that wants to rot, and that is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line on top of it after that with honey that has been beaten with flour, the shells of cherries, and crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however bloodletting occurs, then administer a cautery with a crescent-shaped cauterizer, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is a jointed instrument to two positions at once, namely for bloodletting and wounds when they rot.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If however it bites the head of a virgin and destroys everything in an hour: then you must insert a lead pipe into the urethra of the penis to soak the weak one on top of it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In adherence however of the foreskin with the head of a virgin, and this adherence does not occur unless in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required above it: and sometimes adherence occurs because of a wound or abscess: therefore you must scrape it off with a Spatumili obtuse, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the virgin is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to precisely distinguish between them, then you must scrape off something from the head of the virgin and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the prepuce, when it is thin, might be pierced due to its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the virgin with a thin linen cloth that has already been made into water cold, so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with styptic wine until it becomes solidified.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of children and the treatment of them from error that has happened to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the solution to continuity, as are other wounds: nevertheless, since it is our operation, our will, and its use is proper in children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and a way that leads more easily to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found that the majority of artisans and phlebotomists use cleansing by circumcising with a scalpel and with forceps: and they use those who are affected, and ligaudo with thread, and incision with a needle.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already proved all these methods, and I have not found a better cleansing with forceps, and a binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a scalpel, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer is stretched: therefore it is necessary to make another incision and cause future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the cleaning is done by means of the affected part, that is, digitally, as surgeons use it, the incision of the external member's limb is not secured: because perhaps he may enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleaning with a claw, perhaps the iron may avoid it, and spoil your operation: and the skin of the child is short by nature, and often born thus, which does not need cleaning: and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in cleaning with forceps and ligature with thread, a good experiment has been shown to me: because the forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you put your hand on it, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they occur according to one operation at one time: and a compression of like figure is made, containing the skin of the maiden from all part, with which not at all an error falls.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of your own operation is, that you make him to suspect, especially the child, if it is of those who understand a little, which you do not do, except that you tie a thread in its own: and you let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him to enjoy and rejoice in every way possible for you that he may receive his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him to stand between your prepared hands of stature, and not be sitting: and hide the forceps in your arm, or under your foot, that the child may see them not at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his maiden's skin, and blow in the skin, and draw it upwards, until the head of the maiden comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from that which is collected in it dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked location with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie the lower part of it with a secondary ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb, and ensure good retention of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly elevate the skin upwards, and extract the head of the woman.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and place powder above: and above the powder, a cloth in which the expanded vein was spread, boiled in rose water, shaken with rose oil. With recent good: and let him lie on it until another day: and care for the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But the form of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be sharp and inclined: so that a branch of the crippled one does not exit in them: and let the length of the two sharp parts be as the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But the error that occurs in cleansing is: because perhaps the internal skin has escaped entirely, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary, that you extend it from your hour with your nail before the formation of the pus in the location: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a needle, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed, and what remains under the wound is inflated, an abscess: then let it go, until the abscess sets warm, and scrape it with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the woman.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat that with the powder that consolidates the wound from the powders which we mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it occurs above the skin and reaches the upper parts, it does not harm him even that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat that with what we said until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the extraction of a stone retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an operation done with stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar to those we mentioned from methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the stone does not dissolve, and you see the retention of it to be due to the stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he should be lying on his knees cared for.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet will be placed on his back, and he will extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and bind his weak breath as much as possible to him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	He is therefore pushed towards the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone: hence the retention of urine is relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not dissolve with what we said, and the matter is strong on the weak: then it is necessary that the assistant of the extraction with the instrument which is called the sling, whose form is this: It should be made of silver, and be thin, light, concave like the cannula of a bird's feather in subtility of the ray, long in the likeness of the palm of one and half: it should have a thin cannula in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie a piece of linen, or cotton, a good ligature at its extremity: and introduce the extremity of the thread in the lower part of the sling: and cut with forceps if there is any superfluity from the linen, but introduce into the cannula with force, as an eel.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the catheter with oil or butter and chalk, and make the sick person sit on a seat, and brocate the urethra, and the penis with moist oils and oil of olives, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the catheter into the penis with ease until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it from the upper part near the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the catheter into it until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person feels that it has already reached the empty place: and this is not done in this order unless the channel through which it goes is where there is twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the string will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw it, and make the string run through the urinary channel: and repeat the catheter, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of the bladder with Chlorphydrate.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood is congealed in it, or pus is contracted in it, and water and medicines are desired to distill into it: then make with an instrument called Chlorphydrate, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And a hollow place, where the thing that pushes is according to the amount that fills it without addition until when something is drawn with it from moisture: and when it is pushed, it expels it far away: as Chlorphydrate does, which throws naphta, that is, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you want to draw out moisture from the urethra, insert the tip of a syringe into the moisture and pull it upwards with what is being pushed towards the top, as the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the syringe.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its tip into a needle, as we have mentioned in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the moisture with what is being pushed, for that moisture has already reached the bladder immediately, so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a fine catheter by which the bladder is catheterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gold: whose head is higher and similar to a small camel's hump, and under which there is a pouch in which the string lies.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram and place it in the moisture with which you want to catheterize the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two pouches with a strong string and double thread, and warm the moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the tip of the catheter into a needle, and then tie your hand over the bladder with moisture with a proper string, until the weak one feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however there is not a bladder present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they unroll.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, like a roll of parchment: after you place it in it what you want from the moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and make with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have spoken of the division of the species of stone, and of its cure with remedies, and I have mentioned the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys, and bladder, and the signs of that disease; and I have spoken of the operation of stone in the bladder, with hand and incision: and it is a stone which is formed in the bladder properly: and that which is adherent to the lancet: and I am narrating this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone formed in the bladder most often occurs in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its fineness: and there appears in it white sand, and a weak man scrapes his lancet with it, and struggles with it, and often hangs on to it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he rises up, and passes with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure of boys is easy, from which they follow up to fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	And in young people it is medium, in that which is between the two: and of him whose stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if small, its cure is opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all to cleanse the sick man with enema, which draws out all the feces that are in his intestines: for often it prevents the discovery of the stone at the inspection.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick man should be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved to the lower parts: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or jump from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his buttocks, so that the bladder is entirely inclined towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then seek him out, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hurry immediately with a cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary for you to wipe the index finger with oil of your left hand, if the boy is weak: or the middle finger if he is a complete young man, and introduce it into his anus, and seek out the stone until it is under your finger: and turn him gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it towards the external opposite place of the incision: and order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand towards the upper parts: and with the other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce a probe with the following shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be on it, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that it is external wide, and internal narrow, according to the amount that is possible for the escape of the stone from it not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger which is in the anus stones against the incision, and exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone are those angles and margins, why its escape is difficult because of it.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, similar to a gallbladder, and round: and its escape is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	To those who have angles and margins, add in the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thusly, then it is necessary to place the ingenuity above it: or to tie above it with a belt that is worn properly, whose end is like the moon, which ties over the stone, and does not slip from it: or to insert an instrument under it, with a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot do so above, then slightly enlarge the opening.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from blood pinches you, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push the first large one against the wall of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push a little after that one: and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is quite large, then it is better to separate above it with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to a weak person of two things, either that he dies, or that he experiences constant drip of urine: because the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it exits: or use ingenuity in the fracture of it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tie it, and place on it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that the abscess remain warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the weak person on his back, and do not untie the ligament, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you untie it, rub the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with diaphenine ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, a hot poultice is added to a boil, and it is corroded, and similar things happen: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from coming out of it: and this is known by the escape of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and remove that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it will cause the bladder to rot, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply whatever is appropriate to it from the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of the entire cure, to bind two buttocks, and apply a poultice, as the reason for the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the virgin, and it is stuck in it, and prevents the escape of urine: then cure it with what I will tell you before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Often you will be saved from the incision by this cure, for indeed I have proved it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a Perforator from ironwood, whose form is triangular at the extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with that wand under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforator into the wand with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone: and revolve the perforator by your hand in it slowly: and try to make the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon what remains of the stone from the outer part of the wall.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	Indeed, it is broken, and exits with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a rope under the stone, and another rope above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the wall between the two ropes.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards dissolve the rope, and clean the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the rope under the stone unless it does not return to the bladder: and the rope above, unless when the rope is dissolved after the stone exits, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for this reason you must raise the skin when you tie the rope above, so that it returns to its complement, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ On the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are not formed much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if it happens to some of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prevented because of many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who hides herself from the doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity calls for it, then it is necessary to take a woman as your doctor, one who is well-versed in medicine and not easily found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you are unable to find her, then seek a chaste, clever, and present female midwife who is well-versed in the art of childbirth: make her present, and especially instruct her to do everything that you command her after examining the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary for her to examine whether the woman is a virgin: then she should insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she finds it, then she should cover it with her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the weak bladder and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then it is necessary for her to gradually move it from the bladder opening towards the lower parts with great skill, until she reaches it at the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cover it over the bladder at the middle of the urethra and at the root of the thigh, from whichever part she prepares it and feels the stone in that part: her finger should not be removed from the stone, covering it underneath: and the incision should be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the radium over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision an amount proportional to the size of the stone that has emerged from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these, the small and large, gentle and rough, long and round ones with branches are to be distinguished.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kind, as it is indicated to you by this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore it bleeds, then add at the place of the wound ground zegi, and hold it for an hour until the blood stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and make, that you prepare with you from tools, which I said in extraction of the stone in men, that you assist by those in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If therefore it overcomes you the flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which is cut: then put dust on the place, and bind it with dust with a decent binding: and do not remove it: and let go the stone, and do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps indeed the sick woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then heal the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood is calmed after days, and the place rots, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On the cutting of the hydrocele.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Hydrocele is not, unless the collection of moisture in the white bag, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called white.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own pouch, which nature prepared for itself in the part of the eye, until it is thought: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white, which we said: and it does not make that rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation indeed of this hydrocele, is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from the blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For its color is inclined towards yellowishness, or it is red bloody, or filthy, black, or it is watery white, and that is the most.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where there is an accumulation of water, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the side white, which we said, then the abscess is round to the length somewhat like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own cloth, then the abscess is round with part of an egg, and therefore the man fears because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white side, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you want to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the abscess with a square instrument, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which issues from the end of the instrument, judge of that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with the iron, then it is necessary for you to command the sick person, that he be bled if possible, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie on his back on a high bed somewhat, and put under him many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you sit on his left, and command the servant, that he sit on the right of him, who extends his rod to one of the two skin of the testicles, and to the part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide-mouthed bottle, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle by length, until near the nipple: and make the cut according to the straightness of the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white side containing: and remove him and observe, or beware that you remove him from this, so that your excoriation is from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly scrutinize with the excoriation according to the quantity that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then perforate the sponge full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the sponge to the upper part, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut the sponge however you can cut it, either entirely or in pieces, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine, there is no safety in the incision, so that the water does not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if it proceeds out from its own skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sponge, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find one that is corrupted from another blackness, then it is necessary to bind the vessels, which are the supporters, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its supporter, and extract the one: then care for it with that which we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if the water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two roots: therefore cut off the other part according to what you did in the other one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is balanced for you, so that the operation is one, then do: and then wipe off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections immersed in oil, or in rose oil: and place a different wool that you have immersed in wine and oil over two testicles, and stretch it over the belly: and place double cloths above, and they are swabs: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, wash them, and fill them with carminative la na, according to this similitude: and make their extremities which are pressed from the cot, or wet wool: and they are gathered together with a binding in the loins of the beasts: and one extremity takes above the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the part of the comb: and two extremities above two hips inferior, and two extremities other on two groins, and it is gathered together all the binding in the loins of the beasts.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this instrument is artificially medicated with a cautery at the place of the cut with iron: and it is, that you take the cautery surgical knife, and you separate with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have told: until when it detaches the white containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The letter Greek is imitated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that sifac, and it is ignited, until the whole moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sifac with hooks, and scrape with the surgical knife ignited, and cut it according to what is possible to you, until you remove all its roots.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware from the egg, lest it touch it fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and farther from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if contradiction to you makes in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of cauterization abscess hot, or flow of blood, or other thing: then it is necessary that you cure what contradiction to you makes from that with the cure which corresponds to it, according to what was previously said.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is timid and does not await this operation due to its horror: then perform the puncture as I have described it, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by that which we have said about the signs, which is a watery ram's horn: then you must make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the abscess in its lower part with a narrow-bladed knife: and place the incision according to the length of the body, and let it be a wide opening, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place on the warm place, and bandage him, and let him go to let out the remaining water: then care for him until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is resistance to the outflow of water at the hour when you are puncturing it: and this is not because of any other reason, but because the white cloth causes contrariety in the wound's opening, and prevents the exit of the water: then you must insert a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydropsy is drawn out, whose form has preceded: or add to the operation of the wound for a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it collects, then repeat the same method, and the sick person will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of fleshy rams' horns.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the cut on this ram's horn, there is often a danger of harm due to fear in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its release should be saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of abscesses.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies of people, from which the testicles are composed: and this is caused by many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	either from an excess of sharp, or sharp, which is poured out towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	or from impact.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscesses is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found for it: and it is a heavy abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sense for it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as has already been mentioned: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, what is caused by the swelling of the arteries is known by the position of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which is caused by the swelling of the veins does not spread at all from it when pressed with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a cut be made on this kind, and on the remaining flesh: and it is to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the wound upwards, and extract it with a white sponge: and free the suspenders from the vases, and tie the vases: and cut the suspenders after you have freed it from all parts of the parts of the wound.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the wound is solidified with those fleshy parts, then it is necessary to draw the wound, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something from the sponge, or in that which is between the vases: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round cut.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however the birth of the flesh is in a place of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When however the operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose-scented oil and wine: then care for it with the rest of the care, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Regarding the care of Rambis, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A boil is inflamed in a certain inflammation, similar to a bubo, with the softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for an infirm movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the care of this sickness, there is from fear, because of that which preceded the remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary, that we say the operation in it according to what they did first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that you should do make sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the support of the testicles to the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with vessels which are near the virgin: and another servant holds them, and extends them with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad flat sharp crosswise section in a straight direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off from all parts, as we said to you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them a needle in which is the double thread, and tie it in the first place where the Vites occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what gathers from the humidities putrefying.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then, care for the wound and the healing of other wounds, in which the intention is to generate health, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the grape occurs with all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove them for this reason, the testicles with the vessels: so that the egg does not lack nourishment, because of the incision, and it rots or dries up, and it is not a remedy with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this intestine is from the incision that occurs in the siphon extended over the belly in the part of the groin from the bladder.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the siphon or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species occur from many causes. Or from a blow. Or from a jump. Or from a shout. Or from a heavy lifting and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the siphon.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which occurs gradually over a long period of time, and it does not occur suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in breadth to depth: therefore, because the siphon compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the incision of the siphon, because it causes to occur from the beginning of its severe pain suddenly: and it is an abscess different, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the external siphon.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with the intestine of the small intestine: and this is called the ram's horn intestine, and the small intestine: and sometimes it forms with moisture.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine of feces, and it is retained there: and it is with it a sign of weakness, because it causes a slight pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this sickness's symptoms with iron, there is fear: therefore it is necessary to guard against such a case.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you order the sick person, to reduce with his own hand the intestine to the inner concavities of its own, if it does not return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should lie down on his chest between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testicles all along the length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix two hooks in the lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the section should be according to the amount, that it is possible, so that an egg can come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin of the testicle, and what is under the skin of the testicle, until when the egg is detached from the albumen, hard from all parts: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white egg, which is under the skin of the ovary, and between the white egg, and complete with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the ovary.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicle: and when you do this, extend the white egg upwards, with your left hand: and raise the egg with the white egg to the part of the incision: and order the servant, to extend the egg upwards: and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind the completed solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And be careful with your fingers, so that there is nothing wrapped around the unfolded intestine in the white, hard sphincter.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something from it: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it at the last sphincter, that is, the tunic, which follows the section of the testicles: then cut off the protruding ends until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them on top of some with the figure that is in the form of a cross: and tie them with the sphincter, of which we have said, because it is under the skin of the testicles by a strong ligament, until it cannot send anything from the vessels that nourish them to them anything: so that nothing hot inflammation comes from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the ligament according to the outer ligament, far from the first ligament by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments let go from the sphincter, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut off the rest of it all according to its roundness, and take out the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut off in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus flowed, as we have mentioned in that which was previously mentioned.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a wet bandage in oil, and place on the wound: and apply the ligament that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sphincter that we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For often this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament until it falls off on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then apply hot water and the same thing we mentioned earlier until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the wound treatment until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	¶ On the Fuzzy Caterpillar
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this fuzzy caterpillar, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat its wound with a knife.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said that it happens just as we mentioned in the fuzzy caterpillar that is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to tie the wounds after cutting with something below it: then dry in the middle, and care for it finally with what opens it, until the wounds fall off: and care for the wound as we mentioned earlier until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	¶ On the Disruption that Happens in the Groins
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture happens in the groins, as we mentioned earlier, and the location is raised, and nothing from the intestines falls down to the testicles: but if it does fall down, it is only a little, and it returns to all hours: however, if that time prolongs with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines fall into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we mentioned earlier.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach is extended: then it is softened, and the location swells, and it rises up.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with the cauterizer, as we mentioned earlier in its story.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with a knife, in this way: and it is, that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the area of the burst abscess and protruding wound, across its width, according to the measure of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the alsifak and those under the skin, until when it tears the white sifach, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the probe and place it on the protruding area from the sifach, and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then tie two protruding areas on the end of the probe from the sifach, and connect one with the other with a stitch: then remove the end of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifak at all, nor stretch anything, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat that with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	So when you cut the thread, clean it and restore the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For alsifak contracts, and no protrusion of the burst is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because the flesh that is between them is softened, and it disfigures its appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about its treatment to make the sick person lie on his back, and cut the skin that has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should join two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, use three or four stitches on the first excess of the softened skin, and a strong stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then, cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then, care for the remaining wounds until they heal, and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	About Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of this, it was allowed for me not to mention it in my book: and it is not necessary to remember it, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when asked about it: and that he know its cure for those to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other is that we often need castration of certain animals for our young, such as cattle, goats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that Castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by abrasion.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by making a cut and a tear.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is as follows: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles are softened and soothed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in Castration by a cut and a tear, it is necessary to hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory, and seal over all that section with one, until when the two eggs proceed: then cut them after you have scraped each, and do not leave on them any of the scarfskin except the thin scarfskin which is on the sacks.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of Castration is better than that which is done by abrasion: because abrasion perhaps leaves something in the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the care of Hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is of men according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	Their male organ is because it appears to follow the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the breast like small male testicles projecting to the outside: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of three species, two from men, and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut the added flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for those wounds with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there its care at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the tenting, and flesh projecting in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tenting is perhaps added to the natural thing until it becomes deformed and ugly in appearance: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much, that it expands like in men, and reaches even to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold the excess of the tenting by hand, or with a knife, and cut: and do not end in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that is born, is flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and for this reason some call the sickness caudata.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore we must cut it as we cut the umbilical cord, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ About the care of Alratica, which is a wound of a woman not punctured.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is a wound of a woman not punctured, or it has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from the sickness that preceded it: and this is made either from flesh born added, or fine spider webs, or thick ones: and it is made in the deep of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents sexual intercourse and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made by the sight of the midwife, if the opening is visible nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not visible, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the opening is from fine spider webs, and it is near two lips: then hurry, and tear it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place on two lips cotton.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers of your hands at the same time, and the woman is on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force, until the fine spider webs are torn and the opening is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and the woman should cover it every day, so that the spot does not become hardened by another substance.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the pus is thick and foul-smelling, then it must be separated with a wide flat leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the pus is made of flesh, then hang it with needles and cut it: and let there be medicines with you that sedate the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle aggregated with white lead.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not harden quickly, hold it for several days: and then administer dry linen from flax, and then care for the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes the birth of flesh from the womb will occur: therefore it must be cut in this way: until there is no cancerous pus, for the cancerous pus that is in the womb, there must not be any contradiction with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor red in the wounds of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the veins, until blood flows from them frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids are removed, they become Athehelil: and I have already said in the division of their species, and signs of them: and I will say here what can be received from them for treatment, and what cannot.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to sense: then there is no cure with iron for it.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	These among them which are above the opening of the womb upon which the sense falls, are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the athyhelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them on them at the flow of blood from one powdered cuts without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thou, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards lay her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and the shells of pistachios, and of hens, and similar.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, good: and if not, make it stick to her back windy, and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossae, or the juice of the bark of alder, that is, in white wine, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	But Albarth red is similar to the heads of alhaa, and is rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary to cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the lil equally: and care for it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ Of the perforation of the exiture which happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	In the womb, various types of abscesses occur, such as cancer and stone-like abscesses, ulcers, herpes, aestiomemus, fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, and hot abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	Indeed, I have already discussed all these afflictions and their symptoms, as well as their treatments in this work. Now, I must mention the hot abscess that occurs in the womb when it is caused by abscesses that collect pus, and you want to know how to make its opening with a knife.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then, if the pain from the abscess in its beginning is sharp with percussion, flame, and fever: and you see it reddening: if it falls on it, then do not rush with its piercing: and care for it with it so that it helps to mature, until when the sharpness of the accidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then, you should make the woman sit on a seat that leans back, and recline, or be placed on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and her hips should be expanded, and she should place her arms under her knees, and tie both convenient ligaments to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then, the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument that opens the uterine opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Its form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument, that you bend with a rod deep into the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than deep in the uterus, and does not hurt the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is deeper than usual, you should place cushions on top of the roof of the uterus to prevent the entire instrument from entering too deeply into the uterus. Then, you should place a rotating wheel, which runs in the instrument, on its upper side. The assistant should hold the instrument and rotate the wheel until the depth of the uterus is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the exitura appears and is touched by hand, and it is gentle and soft, then you should separate it from its head with a flat spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus is drained, then you should place a piece of lint soaked in rose oil or green oil (which contains some hemostatic properties) on the wound and apply it to the wound and remove the cut in the deep uterus.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place it outside on top of the uterus, and on top of a clean sponge soaked in water containing chamomile flowers.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the uterus and wound are washed with a clyster made of water and honey: then with water containing the root of lily or long-stemmed aristolochia, and then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the uterus, then you should be prevented from treating it with a knife, but treat it with what we said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	® Instruction on obstetrical knowledge, how to treat fetuses that are born alive but not in a natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know the natural form of childbirth first.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs of this (childbirth), you know that when you see a woman being pressed down towards her lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and is relieved by what is above her on account of childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you know that this birth is according to its natural form, and its exit is above its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed down, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended above its head, the afterbirth also goes with it, and is cleansed of those superfluous matters by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But whoever is other than this birth, is unnatural, condemnable.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when sometimes the fetus comes out above its feet, and comes out of its body before its own head, and its legs, and one hand, or one foot: or comes out of its head and one hand: or comes out of its belly: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar things from uncondemnable figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the obstetrician to be wise, subtle in all these things, and to guard herself from error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how its nature is in it, and what is signified by it, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out above its head in its natural exit, and it becomes strong upon the woman, and difficult for her to give birth, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or women hold her: and vapor with a poppy decoction, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert a small, flat instrument between the fingers of the woman, and rest it with the second instrument, and cover it with her nail until the moisture is removed from it: and press the belly of the woman until the child descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then the woman must be enema'd with mucilage of fenugreek, with oil of sisamine.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the enema to be squeezed: and make her sneeze with the conditioned one, and hold her nose and her mouth at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The child will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If however two hands of the child come out first, then the noose must be used to bring them back gently.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upwards: then shake the seat on the ground: and hold the woman, so that she does not fall at the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	Therefore if however the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then cut them, and remove the remaining child: and tie its hand with a cloth, and remove it with equality: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the child comes out on its feet, then it must be pushed upwards: then turn the child gradually: afterwards balance it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then receive one of its feet, and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When however they come out up to the hips, then order her to be squeezed, and make her sneeze with the conditioned one: it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then reduce the child gradually, until you place it according to its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will then easily go out.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if he is prevented from doing everything we have mentioned, then take some mucilage of the marshmallow root, olive oil with sisalin, and dissolved gum: and grind all of it well in a mortar, then use a line with him to draw out the intestine of the woman below.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she has an erection.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that his lower parts are already heated, then make him a poultice of myrrh and apply it to him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he holds the poultice for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and press her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her belly gently.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the stone will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the stone is on the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then he should gradually introduce his hands into the opening.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then she should be bent over her neck, and her feet hang down to the lower parts: and she should lie on the bed, and intertwine her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly gently.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the stone does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypocondria gently, until the stone rises to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce his hands and balance the stone gradually: and tell the woman to press herself, until the stone comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus hangs out laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The method of reducing his hands is employed.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce them, then elevate the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a violent shake.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from the mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if she receives him in childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in reducing the hands, and equal the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to press herself, until she exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus exits on his neck, with his hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of his mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn him, and equal him with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore he is equalized, then place on its blanket what we mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you do that, then make her sit on a seat, and order her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to be pressed: and make her sneeze with the prepared mixture.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus exits prepared on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until it is evacuated from its moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if it hangs on the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not held back, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the insides, until you have positioned it as necessary: and instruct the woman to press herself several times: for he will exit with ease.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins often give birth: and sometimes three, and four are born at once.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is unusual, and it rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed is a thing outside of nature, and they do not live completely: and it contains them, although they multiply, one secondary: and they are separated by the membrane, distinguishing between them tied in the umbilical cord of each of theirs.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out at a natural exit, easily: and they come out with an unharmed exit, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult to come out at birth, and they reach that which we said from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have said: and let it be for a midwife who is subtle, and make it so that it does what it does with ease and delay, and fit it according to every figure with that which is prepared for it from the leading to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembering that what is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb from embryos, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has already been verified to me that a woman aborting gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be in the knowledge of the midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps she will encounter something similar: therefore, let her place that which is necessary against it.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are caring for a dead fetus and it does not exit after the division as I mentioned in the section on medication, and you must perform an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue and is not with any of those accidents from which one fears for her life: then it is necessary that the woman should be reclined on the bed, on her back, and her head should be lowered below, and her legs raised: and the nurse should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the mother with warm oils mixed with honey, and with the juice of the poppy, and with the seeds of flax.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and moisteners: then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with her the place where she can hook nails from the fetus, and suitable places near it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Then consider whether the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then hook nails into its eyes, or into its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its beard, or in its ribs, or in nearby hypocundria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon its feet, then into its shinbone, and in the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the nail with her right hand: and place the curvature of it between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand with ease, and hook a nail in one of those places which we mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should fashion another hook, or a third one if needed, in opposition to the first one, so that the contraction will be equal and not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then the extension should be applied evenly, not just along a straight line, but moved towards all sides, to facilitate its exit: as is done with a tooth when it is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that there be something between them to soften the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained from that, then the midwife should apply some fingers with oil on them and insert them from one side, to turn back what is being retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the baby is born, then they should exchange the hooks to a place that is higher: do this until the whole baby is born.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand is born before the other parts, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it until when the whole hand is born, cut it at the joint of the finger or the elbow: and thus you should do in the other hand and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the baby's head is large, or contraction occurs in its exit, or there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary that a sponge with thorns be inserted between the fingers, and press on the head, and remove the water: or break it with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly he should do if the baby is naturally large in head: then it is necessary that he cut off the afterbirth: or remove it with a misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head protrudes and is tied at the fork, then it is pressed until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it does not become entangled and does not obey the exit, then cut the head bit by bit, as much as you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the abdomen is an abscess or there is hydrops in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above its feet, then its attraction is easy and its direction to the mother's womb is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is tied at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to draw it out with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and press the abdomen or chest until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the other limbs are taken away and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mother's womb is open, then insert your hand deep into the mother's womb and seek with it the head and draw it out with your fingers up to the mother's womb: then insert a hook or two hooks into it and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's womb is closed, because of the abscess that has happened to it: then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather at that time you should administer an ointment of moist things, greasy: and administer plasters: and let her sit in baths that will soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then you should administer what we said about the living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do that, then cut it bit by bit and draw it out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	It is necessary not to leave anything of the second matter inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore, when you have completed your surgical procedure, then administer what we mentioned about hot abscesses that occur in the matrix.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flow occurs, then descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus: then she became pregnant with another man on top of it, afterwards the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore it happened to her after a long time that an abscess formed in her own navel, and it swelled until it was open: and she began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I placed on it some strong attractive plasters: and the bone came out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then she passed several days, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore I was amazed from there, since the bone is not in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought that they were bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Therefore I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better conditions: and she lived thus for a long time, and emits a little pus from it.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not firm this foreign one, except because in it is knowledge, and help to that, which the skilled physician administers with his hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	¶ On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Tightener, by which the levers are equalized, with two pivots on the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vertigo should be more subtle than the strictor: and it is made from either ebony or buxus wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of the entire wood is almost like two fingers: and the edge of each of them is almost one finger long, and the length of each of them is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been attached to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is almost like two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother, so that it opens with them when you turn the two Vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Vertigo that opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another shape similar to that one, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or buxus wood, according to the similarity of a pair of tongs.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see above: and the length of each addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then let her sit on the bed, with her feet hanging down, with what is open between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions connected into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with tongs, equally according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the mother's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of the other Vertigo that they said the ancients called the Form of Impelling, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which a large head is crushed: and it resembles a pair of pliers, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes lame, like pliers in this form, as you see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncinus having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncinus having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of pliers with saw teeth, by which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas and also holders.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used and the more varied their species are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are in their operation and higher among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not look down on any of these instruments as if it were not prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the extraction of the second tooth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second tooth is retained at birth, then you must order the weak to hold their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a conditioned: and hold your hand on her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	Then take a pot and drill a hole in the cover: and put in it opening herbs of the matrix, such as calamint, rue, and aneth, and chamomile, and savory, and lime tree bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and boil them with water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed bulb on the opening of the breastplate pot and at the other end on the bone of the mother: and hold it until steam reaches the hollow of the mother's bone.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For Secundina will exit with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if she remains after this treatment and does not exit: then command the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or marsh mallow.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert into the uterus and seek for Secundina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds her, then take her and stretch her slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however she is attached deep in the mother's womb, then she should insert her hand as we said until when she finds Secundina and slowly extracts her according to rectitude so that the matrix does not fall during a strong attraction: rather it should be changed with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For she then obeys and is kept and avoids adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mother's mouth is tightly closed, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and from the remedy of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if she does not exit with all that we have said, then beware lest you weary her with repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what exits from the mother's mouth to the bone of the mother be bound around the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then smear her with TetraPharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will indeed rot her after days and dissolve and exit.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it rots, the bad smell is lifted from her stomach and head and harms that weak person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate incense should be administered for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients were already familiar with the use of mustard and dried fig incense.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument used to smoke a woman during the retention of Secundinae and menstrual periods is as follows:
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a similar vessel be made of clay or brass: and place the wide end of it over the fire: and the smoke should be placed on the burning coals: hold it until that smoke is consumed, and then repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	¶ On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which have already been narrowed by a sharp spicula.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce that spicula with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp, pointed instrument: and she should be careful not to touch the testicles.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place on it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will become narrowed again, then place a lead tube with many holes in the opening, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And sometimes anus narrowing also occurs from the consolidation of the wound, or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it should be incised, then treated with what we said about the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	¶ On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodosities and Grossness which occur near the anus, deformed: or in the space of one part: and it is a fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that ancient bandage is removed, it reveals a flow of watery, white liquid or thin pus from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas penetrate through them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, those that penetrate are known by what exits from them due to diarrhea and softness, when an infirm person has diarrhea: and perhaps it exits from them worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas when they extend up to the bladder and the vaginal opening.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating up to the hip joint and the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that, however, from which it is known that the penetrating fistula extends up to the anus, even from one that does not penetrate, is to insert your finger into the anus and insert a thin probe of air or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or a horsehair needle until you feel the probe or the needle in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it entirely, nor does anything exit from the opening due to diarrhea, nor softness, nor worms as I said: then you know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or the urethral opening: then its meaning is the exit of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place may consolidate with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint or the thigh bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting up to the bone: and the discovery of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus exits from it always: and that medication does not hold in it, nor consolidates with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas that penetrate everything, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vanity to him, from which they are formed by foolish doctors.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, there is hope of healing with a probe: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven: and it is, that the sick person lies under your hands on his back: and lift up his legs up to above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then he will insert the bent end of lead or air, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it has reached the probe.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the sick person feels it around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	So if you feel that the probe has already penetrated itself through your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and him, or flesh: then you certainly know that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor in it, since there is no healing in it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	But they said that in some men flesh is healed, and from the medication by which it is hoped to be improved, it is, that you burn a thin cauterizer according to the width of the fistula, as it preceded, and insert the burning one into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times, until you know that all the flesh added with filtered ashes, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for that with unwrapped linen in butter, until those flesh that have been burned come out: then care for that with ointments generating and consolidating flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if he exits, try again, and if he does not reach up to your finger that is in the anus, and it is between him and the tenting cloth, which is thick and slimy from flesh, or puss: and you see a fistula following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you go drying with the tent that is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the tent's extremity reaches, and the tent is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered fleshy parts, which are similar to the feathers of a bird's quill, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood binds you, and dissolves between you and the operation so that you can cut those fleshy parts: then it is better to do it, and faster for healing, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cauterizer with fire collects good relations, it adds burning of those fleshy parts added, and removal of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with unrolled linens in butter, or crushed cabbage leaves, until the place emits pus, and those burned fleshy parts come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for that wound with solidifying ointments, generating hard flesh: and they are medicines in which there is stypticism and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then he is already healed: and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already reached up to the depth of the anus, and is extended away from the excess of the body: then put your finger into the anus, and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If you feel a pull and there is between you and it a cloth from silk, or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation in that unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, because it is administered in it one of three ways: either to cauterize it as we said, or to separate it, until you reach its concavity, so that it may be possible for you to insert linen and cure it from the nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the cutting, so that you may not cut the muscle containing the anus, and it happens above the weak outcome of defecation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cure that with what we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it may be healed: or lengthen that cloth, and cleanse it after you have separated it almost to the anus, as we said, or with another sharp-ended tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those fleshy parts which are in the cutting, until where you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try the healing of the wound with the cutting, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes it will follow the fistula in this way: and it is, when you insert the probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take the probe with sharp-ended, which is like a needle, that is, preparing leather, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a rolled thread from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, however, the penetration is in the inner margin of the anus near the edge, then remove a thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and remove the end of the thread, and gather both ends together: and tie them, and release it on one day, or two days: and as much as the thread enters into the flesh, tie it well, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread fall off: then care for the wound, until it heals and becomes healthy.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate however you are prepared for it, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have to do it so that you do not cut the tendon.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spiculum of the fistula, in which it penetrates, whose curvature is very sharp and pointed, and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows from the incision of them: and care for the fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For indeed they are inside the anus, like coal or plums: or rather they are like the grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows clear water, or little blood flowing constantly: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	The treatment of what is inside the anus is, as you advise the sick person to sit on a stool: and it is expressed until the anus opens and the ashes appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold in them the hooks, because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a coarse cloth from double-woven linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder some hot powders on them after the incision, so that they remain in place as a cauterizer.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the other treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not obey the egressions, then enema the sick person with a small-mouthed enema in which there is a bite, so that it may be washed out with what is in the anus, and it may obey the egressions quickly, when the sick person expresses himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the ashes are outside the anus, then the matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And those who abhor incision with a knife, then it is necessary that you administer a suture to them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an unwound thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the ashes to the upper part, and make it penetrate with the needle from the other side of its root: and unwind the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and they should be horizontally: and tie the ashes with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then draw out the thread, and remove the splinter.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the splinters, and let one of them remain: do not remove it so that excess blood does not flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a rose-scented or pitch-soaked cloth on the buttocks, and place it on the buttocks: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it go, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the splinters fall out, take care of them with ointments, and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the Treatment of Wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For many times it happens from the dryness of the dung, and the constraint of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they are dry and do not respond to medicine: then you must scrape with the Spatula of the lancet, or with your nail, until they become moist, and remove the upper skin that prevents them from healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they heal according to what is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not heal: then repeat them with a stronger razor than the first, until they bleed much, and then scrape them, and take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	¶ On the Treatment of Wounds that are inverted and not inverted: and Splinters of Bristles, and Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that Almirmar is not other than a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a claw: and it is found in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain occurs from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary to follow what is around the claw, and to be held with forceps, or with a hook, and to be removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then, follow this care: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the dry ones, there is one prominence that is small, rough, poured out, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often happen in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is, that you stretch the dry ones, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now the dry ones will be eliminated, both those that are not, with the instrument that I say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And a formica is also a small prominence that is poured out, coarse, on the surface of the body, bending deeply into it: and when it finds it, cold is felt in it, similar to the sting of an ant, and it becomes in the whole body: and much of its effect is in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is, that you take a needle from the feather of a goose, or the feather of a strong-winged bird: and place the needle on formica, until the circle of the needle is contained in its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the needle, until you separate what is in the circumference of formica: and place it in deep flesh, and eliminate formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with the needle of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the needle be pulling the uncovered sound, so that it alleviates the apprehension and its rotation on the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize formica according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	The forms of instruments that are used for lancing in intestinal ailments, and for the solution of the belly, and the colon:
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the lancet is made of silver, or of gold-plated metal, or of bronze, or of hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made small and large, according to those in which it is used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is used for the treatment of small children, should be small: and those whose bellies are weak, or painful, likewise their lancets.
Clistere magnum.	Large lancet.
Cistere paruum.	Small lancet.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The handle of it, that is, the upper part in which the sheath is attached, should be wide according to this manner: and there should be a distinction on it so that the sheath can be tied as you see, and the lower part which enters into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, gentle, sharp, drawing to subtlety: and in one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the holes should be according to the thickness of the needles, and a little less, and the sheath in which they put medicines from the bladder of an animal: or from paper which is according to the form of a small asafetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced through the holes as it is turned, and there should be a space which is the thickness of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about that, and gather with it an utrem like asafetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is put in that sheath, it should be tied in the head of the lancet between two distinctions with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then apply a poultice with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	This is the shape of a circle drawn here, and the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of applying the poultice with it is: to fill a jar, or bladder, with medicine, which should be warmed according to the amount of tolerance of the sick person: and beware that it is not very hot, or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person should be laid on his back, and raise his legs to the upper parts: and place under him an inthaan, that is, a skin on which men lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity of the poultice with oil, or with white lead, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the attendant should take the jar with both his hands simultaneously, and squeeze it with force, until all that is in the poultice comes out into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the poultice, and raise the sick person's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine drives him to the end, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you apply the poultice to him in the sicknesses of the solution of the belly, and hasten its exit: then repeat the poultice, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are hemorrhoids, or painful abscesses in the anus, then the poultice should be thin, very soft, from the poultices with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the shape of a thin poultice on top of which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ On the healing of head wounds without breaking the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken of the division of wound treatment in the book, and now I will explain their cure by hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are divided according to the way they occur and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things that often cause wounds are like the throw of a stone: either an impact from a sword or a knife, or a blow with a lance, a stick, or an arrow; and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that occur according to the parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or back; and similar things from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the cures of some wounds, so that I may place this reasoning and rule on the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the memory of complex ones will come at the beginning of Chapter 3.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of bone: consider if it is from the throw of a stone or something similar, and if it has already broken the skin only: and it is a large wound, and you fear for the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay this: and remove from him according to the amount of its power: if there is nothing prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if it is little blood that flows out of the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak person beware of overeating, wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prohibits a purge, then the food should be reduced, and one should not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if it happens to him an abscess hot, a lotion infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is a styptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from an abscess hot, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed its air, the powder that I will tell you about a little later: and if it has already changed its air, then place on it some ointments, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from a cut of a sword, and similar: and the lips of it are not gathered together by swabs, then gather it with stitches, according to what I will tell you about wounds of the belly about their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already detected from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in the place of the skin, and command the weak person to be fed on foods in which there is coarseness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like a paste: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	But if you find in the skin a putrefaction, and it does not stick to bone: then cut the whole putrid thing, and throw it out: then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which flows blood: and it is not cut by medicines, then examine over the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you cannot find it, then cut it off with a sharp knife or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity provokes when it does not provide what we said, then cauterize it until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then the matter is easy and light: so that you sprinkle powder on them with this powder, because it hardens them before they change them into air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of Powdering for Flesh Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe a piece of bread, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburned lime: grind it all thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good binding, until it sticks well on top of it, and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with bandages, and let it go, and do not dissolve it while it remains, so that it does not stick.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For that medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does that alone, when you do not have bread and dragon's blood with you in the presence, and lime also makes the same operation in many from great wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not changed into air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if it has already changed into air by some alteration, especially when it is in the time of summer, then there is no intention of this powder's position: therefore take care of it with that which we said, so that you put on top of it some digestive ointments: or put on top of it some pastes made with barley flour, with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if indeed it happens with a wound fracture in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with a probe: and I will now tell you about the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	But if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ability to avoid its treatment with what causes strong hemostasis, such as styptic powders, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because nerves are harmed, and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything very cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is higher than the members: and let that which is used to cure it be from medicines that are mild, such as chalk lotus with sweet water frequently infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a suture: or cut its lips with cotton.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or it occurs in the sinuses in the lower part of it, where already pus has collected, then pierce it in a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery has already been cut in the wound, and blood flow from it follows: then separate, or dry it, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if necessity requires it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the spinal cord has already injured the throat, or the entire throat, and the patient's life is saved: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture over the cannula of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather keep it even, and reduce it back to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then apply a suitable constriction, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then remove it: if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as much as you can from them: and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound rots, and separates and heals its exit.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder on it that I have mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it seems that the bone is in the wound and a fistula forms: then care for it with the ointment that I mention in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	About wounds in the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a blow of a lance or knife: and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore a draft escapes from the wound when he is breathless from it, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is recent with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor apply a constriction to it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returned to the heart, and kill the sick person: but place in it an attractive ointment, and dissolve it in the day twice.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed you do not have oil present, then place an old cloth in the wound opening to absorb what is coming out of it due to moisture: and make sure the sick person sleeps over the wound, so that what is collected in it may be drawn out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three or more days have passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor trembling of the heart, nor stricture in breathing, and you see other aspects of his condition good: then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore care for him and with liniments, and with other treatment, until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed his healing is excused, and he always opens, then know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore care for it from its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision of a sword, or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then care for him with that which preceded from the stitch, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has cut out pieces from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to remove those pieces, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, for the extraction of them is eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of other wounds happening in other members the judgment in treatment is the same as that which we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ Of wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their excretions.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly is great, and middle, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	When the intestine sometimes escapes from a great wound, or when there are many intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why is it more difficult and challenging to insert them and suture them back in place.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	Even a small rupture becomes difficult to repair due to another method.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, if you do not quickly insert them back to their original place immediately after the rupture, it becomes difficult because they swell, open, and expand, making the insertion difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, a medium-sized rupture is better than a small one, as the insertion and reduction of the intestine are not difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that there are four ways to perform the suture of the wound.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are used for the wound of the intestine and for other wounds of the body, while two other sutures specifically communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper for the wound of the intestine, and I will tell you each one with an explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say that when the wound is small and something escapes from the intestine through it, making it difficult to reduce it, then it is because of one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either due to the smallness of the rupture, as we said earlier, or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	Therefore, when it is like this, you should heat it up by soaking a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with vinegar, pepper, and salt, and massage it with that until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine with its strengthening property helps in resolving the swelling better than water alone.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the inflation is already resolving, then moisten the intestine with the water in which it was boiled, either hot or warm.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this, its entrance is soothed with a small amount of salt.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is excused after this treatment, then cut a little in the rupture, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than cutting: and no force is made to cut after need and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be curved, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and its tip should not be very thin with Spatula's thinness, but rather a little blunt: and that is what resembles a hook, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged, and enters the intestine, then it must be reduced to its natural form in its own place, if possible over it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then you must make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then put his head, and the chest of that person higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if it is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your attention, and always your consideration in this, that the part in which the wound is higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it must be, that you administer it to great wounds, and to medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, put it according to how it is prepared to you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a faithful servant stand present between your hands, who holds the entire incision with his hand: and bring together his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then gradually remove from her what follows the stitch, bit by bit: and this is the common method of a single stitch.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the incision a length equal to a digit's ring, that is, the length of a doctor's finger: and fix the needle on one side, and insert the thread in both ends of the skin, with both ends of the sifac which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other part, and now you have gathered together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the sifac: and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both sides at once, until two lips of the wound are gathered together by proper aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle on them: afterwards, tie it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Then do not cease doing this with that which you need from the needles, until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be of medium thickness between thickness and thinness: because thin needles very quickly pierce flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be of medium thickness in thinness, and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary, that the needle be fixed in both ends of the skin nearby much: so that flesh does not quickly pierce, and the wound open before its consolidation, and they do not lengthen even with the stitch, so that the wound be not hindered from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then incise the tip of the acum, so as not to wound the weak one while he is sleeping; and place on them pullovers made from cloth from all sides, which will hold the tips of the acum: and let them go, until you know that the wound has become consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitching with acum is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because it is sufficient in their stitches for one needle, or two, or about those.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second stitch is common, as it aggregates with the stitch the extremities of four: extremities, two skins, and extremities two sifac in vice one, with a needle in which is wrapped the thread equally in fineness, and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, reduce the acum from the part from which you began, so that the thread wrapped from the upper part of the wound falls: so that it is a stitch, just like the stitch by which they tie the cloth together, and place between every stitch an amount of thickness equal to the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	But this stitch men know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I healed the wound of a man which had occurred in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a tear in the wound of about one palm: and it had exited from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore reduced it after it had stood outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in the space that it was for about 15 days: and I cared for him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, returning to his dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And by a miracle, I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Since I was in a place where ointment was not found, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed on the wound an old rag twice a day, and frequently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	However, two kinds of sutures are called proper according to the account of the story.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And there is, as you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and the flesh going according to the length and width of the whole body: let go the end of the thread in the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate in the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same end from the outer part to the inner: and let go the end of the thread which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate in the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make the needle penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate in the end of the thread, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same side, and follow it with the end which is from the other side out of the thread in another side, and draw out the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back to that skin, and follow it with the end of the thread which is in another side with this end: and draw it out from the skin which is from the part of it, and make it once and again, and make it thus after thus, until you have drawn it out entirely outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the main method of this suture is to suture the pelts of sheep in such a way that one edge of the skin meets at one end, and you let the other edge meet at the other end until it is completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This method is described as follows: to make it similar to the way some doctors treat them, so that they gather all parts to their corresponding part by nature: and they apply one edge of the skin to its other edge, and the other edge of the mirror to its other edge.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done as I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should shape the needle into the edge of the mirror near you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that place only: and let go of both edges of the skin.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part in both edges of the skin.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them and also make it penetrate both from the inner part to the outer part in both edges of the mirror, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than a common easy suture, and it is the suture that precedes the memory.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is also the saying of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly with two needles is corrected.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	This means that you should insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, which is at your disposal, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the way those who suture the pelts equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than those of the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment indeed of the treatment of wounds, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Because when you seek the recent wound with its own blood, before it changes itself by air: and reduce the intestine, and its own, and prepare it: then place on top of the powder of the flesh of a man.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already changed the wound: then place on it some ointments which are present to you, until they make pus: and fall the threads, and harden the sinew, and the marl.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is the cure of the other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have the medicines present to you, then place on it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, old wool: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other treatment in many positions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound communicates to the main members in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse old wool in oil of tempered warmth, or in rose oil: and place it in the circumference of the places which are between the groins, and under the ribs.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	Because if it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens): then enema it with strengthening wine, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and made a penetrating hole up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the thick intestine is easier for healing: and that what is from those which are from the thin, more difficult for healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine known as the Jejunum does not heal from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is made up of veins, and the size of them, and due to the delicacy of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is pus, and you are able to extract it: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed a certain time, and it has become green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place where the discharge came from it, in order that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in pus there are veins and an artery.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: in order to relieve the pull on you, and the extraction of it at the case of pus, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembrance of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible to be restored in some men: because I saw that he was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a lance, and it was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and it had become an old wound: and it became a fistula, and there was emission and flatulence from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore placed the cure, until I was not confident in his healing: and I did not stop to delicately care for him, until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the place was already consolidated, I feared for the weak, that something bad would happen to him on top of what had happened in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, copulating, entering the bath, and exercising in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenter said, because when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small: then it is necessary to bind it according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take large ant heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two wound lips, and place one ant head with an open mouth on top of the two wound lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when it sits on them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and is not dissolved.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant head near the first, and do not stop doing it with the ant after the second ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it back, and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those ant heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and healed, and no harm is caused completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to bind the intestine even with a fine thread: which is scraped out from the intestine of an animal, and attached with it when it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and scrape off a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind the fine thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and with it heal the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it back to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except cauterization, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the Care of Boils and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic and develops into an ulcer, does not heal, and always emits pus, but is not cut out: then it is universally called a fistula in any member, and we call it by this name.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula in reality is a filtered constriction, hard, white: with which there is no pain, and no concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it by the name of Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in some hours it emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much and little: and it is coarse, and it is delicate.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and does not grow flesh in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, because of the lack of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because there is hard flesh between him and his lips, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is very dirty and filthy: or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter that is put into it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inconvenient in its cure: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by the property of the region, as it happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of difficulties is difficult, and healing of the abscess is delayed by nature: or because there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already demonstrated all these causes and signs of them, and their cures along with their medicines in division: and it is necessary for me to teach you the cure of Fistulae and Zuken, which is done through the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these are the Fistulae that reach to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the spine of the back, or to some jointed compositions: such as the hand, and foot: and from these are those that approach to the proximity of the principal member, and similar.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, of these Fistulae, according to this method, is difficult to heal from afflictions, and does not receive a cure, and the treatment with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from some Fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to approach to the knowledge of it, then receive a probe from air, or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and seek it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is crookedness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead with its own body is soothed, and cured around crookedness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, clean out from it one opening from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture by which you cleanse itself goes towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully examine in what manner it is possible for you: to know whether there is an opening (os) or a nerve, and whether the fistula has a long or short concavity, or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stands over the entire area, with great strength of your hand, with questioning of the patient, and feeling of pain upon compression with your hand on the spot, and similar signs and causes of an abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when you stand over all those places truly, then go to the cure according to your confidence: and it is, that you consider then, whether the fistula is near (propinqua) appearing, or far from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula according to what was previously said by me, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh, or thelul, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is far in depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupt flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer liniments uncovered in sharp medicines: and put them into the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with the knife: do it with her several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have told you.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is an opening, and it has been confirmed to you that this is the case, then inquire about it and dry it according to what I have told you. If something prevents you from doing so from a vein, nerve, or main member, as we have said,
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If the opening is revealed to you and there is something decayed and discolored within it, then scrape it until all of its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what covers it until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and still discharges pus as it did before, then you will know that you have not completely removed the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then reveal it again and carefully make a cut in it and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, that is good; but if not, then you will know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not for you to reach it unless you are willing to let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the opening is small and it is possible for you to do so, then draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for that purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something resists you from the moisture and there is no fear or mistake in the incision, then cut the moisture and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at that moment, then place on the wound something that will putrefy it and leave it until what is around the bones from the flesh and moisture putsrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the incision that you have made in your surgery.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	But if you fear, place on top of it, soaked in crushed sulfur with oil: or soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green herbal ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot and separate the bones from them, their removal is relieved, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, such as the thigh bone, or the hip bone, and similar to them, and that which has rotted from it is a large part: then shave it with the last razor, until that darkness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if that which is in it rotted is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely until the place where corruption has reached: then care for it, until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you of Zuken, which happened to a man in his thigh: so that you may place that example and aid on your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years, to whom it happened pain in his thigh, from the cause which moved above him inside his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh, and there was a great abscess: and he did not have an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, with him time passed with the error of doctors, until the abscess was opened, and many matters converged with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his cure was postponed until the thigh was fistulated, and there were many openings made in him: which all emitted pus, and moistures of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians had been treating him for about two years, and there was not among them a wise one in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters that were flowing out from those openings with great speed: even his whole body was already gangrenous, and his color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore attempted to probe one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they all opened into each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore hastened, and closed over one of those openings, until I uncovered a part of the bone: and I found that it was already rotten, and discolored, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated as far as the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore sawn off what was discovered to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I ordered that there should not be in the bone anything but that corruption which I had cut off and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I was already eradicating it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the healing of the wound with solidifying medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed again, and uncovered above the bone second above the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed off what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted to heal it again.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not healed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I uncovered it again, and did not cease to dig into the bone separately, and try to heal it: and it was not healed, until I dug out about a span of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored him with medicines, and it healed quickly and was cured. This repetition of the operation and incision was not necessary for him, except due to the weakness of the patient, his intolerance, and my fear of causing his death, as he was experiencing symptoms of syncope from excessive evacuation at all hours.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore, he was cured entirely by the cure, and a solid piece of flesh was formed in the place of the bone, and it was made good in his body, and his strength returned: and he returned to his usual dispositions: and he did not cause him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the bone is already broken in the place of the body, then it must be bound like this: take a bandage and bind it at the end of the prominent bone, and order someone to stretch it upwards: and put another bandage of thicker wool first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone, and stretch its end so that you can pull the flesh downwards: and you cover the flesh over the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Then place a piece of wood or a board under the lower bone, because when you do this, it does not prevent the flesh from decaying.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it must be that the cut is over the place of the decay a little, so that there is no decay in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear to his senses, and forces him to another sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	But if the bone is decayed and not prominent, but continues with its part: and the decay is in the middle of it, or in that part: then cover the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the lower log.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	After that, use the saw on the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing is completed from the second side: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption by a little, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and use the saw from the second side where it continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if indeed the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill in it except for scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If indeed the corruption is in the claw of the hand, or in the claw of the foot: then the matter is quite difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary for you to investigate the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it off, and clean it in any possible arrangement to you, and with whatever skill it is corrected for you: when it does not cause you contradiction of the vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the teeth and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their roughness, and their subtlety, and their size, and their proportionality, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary for you to prepare every kind of suitable tool for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the kind of tool you need, when you have with you the study of a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of this art is a witness of the ways of diseases: for then you will already find through yourself that which suits it from the tools for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you in the last number of this chapter's tools, which you will set examples on top of which you will cut, and proof by which you experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Another form of the saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Another form of the saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Another form of the saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw should be made properly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arc be sharp and its edge from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be made properly pyramidal.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the razor's blades.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be in the form of a star-shaped cap: and its points should be in the form of the points of an eagle.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit, unless they are rubbed with this razor when they are rotting, or a large mouth and it is big.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor with a hollow.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the other curved-end razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the small fine razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are shaved.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form of the large razor as well.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a chisel, and its end is like a saw: it will be shown in many places from the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that suits its reason for shaving bones that are pierced.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, and its ends are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from indigo.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it should be made from razor blades, and cutters, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About cutting the ends and sawing bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either due to an external cause or an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicines and the cure does not take effect: and you see the corruption spreading to a member, which nothing stops: then it is necessary to cut off that member up to where the corruption reaches, so that the sick person may escape from death, or from the greater evil that is the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	The sign that this happens is, that the member blackens, until it is thought to be burned by fire, or putrefies after a gangrene: until the corruption reaches up to what follows that member, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when you cut off that member, and also if the cause of the corruption is from the impact of certain poisonous creatures: such as the sea scorpion, and the viper, and the rattlesnake, and the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or the impact is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so that it may reach up to the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut off that from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches the finger of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it attacks that, then cut off the arm at the elbow, in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then the sick person will die.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides that from the cure, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when the corruption attacks in the finger, then cut off that at one joint: and if it reaches the toe of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it rises up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for the release and leaving behind the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting the member, or of sawing it, is this, that you bind the ligament below, which you wish to cut: and bind the ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And the servant should stretch one ligament downwards: and the servant should stretch the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you should separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the flesh is completely exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut, or it is sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place cloth on all parts of the body, and not touch the sawed place with the saw: and an additional wound should not occur to the weak, and a warm abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood flows inside while you are operating, then you should cauterize the place quickly: or place on top of it some powders which absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medical treatment, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with a suitable ligament for it, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing happening to him which I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because blackness occurred in his foot, with a burn which resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his finger, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man removed himself from himself, after he saw the corruption occurring in his member with its violence, which he found from his pain, and burning of it: and he cut it at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in his own index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I attempted to restore the excess moisture with the medicine I placed on his hand after washing his body: but the excess did not rebound, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut off his hand: but I refused to do so, hoping for the return of that excess moisture: and I also feared for him during the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the power of man was above that case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Then, since he had lost hope in me, he returned to his own land: and he came to me from him, because he rushed, and he cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story, unless it be an aid to that which falls under this kind of sickness: and so that there may be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	¶ On the care of wounds, and the quality of cleansing with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the time of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and that which is in it from the pus exits, and there remains a vacant place as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is above it is like a fabric which has become thin: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor does it touch the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: but if the time of its existence is prolonged until it touches some of these members, then it is called a fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is that you incise the entire skin as it unfolds: and especially when it has been thinned out and made like cloth: and you trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and there will be no decay from that final contact: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then care for it with Clisteri: and it is, that you consider to the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that emits from it has a foul smell: then treat it with Egyptian medicine, which is acetic acid, oil, and zinc, equal parts receiving, they are gathered in a jar: and they are boiled over fire, until the medicine turns red: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Sinus with it: and bind its opening, and let the medicine into it at a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: make it for days total, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is treated with water of ashes, when you do not have this medicine present: and it is, that you take charcoal of vine wood, or charcoal of ilex wood: and throw it on it water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then wash it, and treat it with it, until you trust that the Sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor water of ashes, then treat it with water and honey, which has already mixed with some of crushed zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	1. Either apply honey mixed with wine and water to it, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing: and the wine makes it adhere to the wound, especially when there is an excess of its astringent and drying properties.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	1. If you do this repeatedly and trust that the wound has already been removed of corruption, then apply honey with that which makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	1. And there is, that you take from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or apply honey to it with certain medicines and other ointments, of which I have written their properties in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	1. But if the wound is narrow, in which the catheter does not fit: then enlarge it slightly with a small iron: or place in it a lint soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	1. And similarly if the wound is also large, then gather its lips with a suture: and leave out of it as much as will enter the catheter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	1. And similarly if the wound from which pus is flowing is elevated to the upper part: then dry it in a lower part which is in it, so that the pus flows out of it downwards: for when pus is compressed in the depth of the wound, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	1. But if it is not possible for you to dry the wound around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the limb with a preparation so that it can drain pus from it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	1. Try to make sure that nothing at all from the pus is retained in it: and take consolidating remedies which are placed on the sign, corresponding to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them upon a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it may cover the entire wound.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the opening of the wound, a little beyond the opening of the wound.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread on the opening with a soft ointment on another cloth, according to the size of the opening: and place it on top of it at a long distance from the opening of the wound, so that the exit of pus is eased from it: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one that is over the opening of the wound is the one that you remove every hour, so that what has accumulated in it from pus may come out: and so that you know whether that which runs out from it is much or little: digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you have again considered the place of the wound itself, whether the master feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it: and whether there is an abscess in it, or whether there is no abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is applied in this way, and you see the matter that comes out over the opening of the wound, then you know that the wound has adhered, or is approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you heal the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if after a long time virulent matter runs out from the wound, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are people who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds: and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if after many days undigested pus runs out from the wound, then you know that the wound does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If the adhesion of the sinuses is delayed and its duration is prolonged, then in the drying of medicines, the physicians should make them such that they are in the substance of their moisture and in the power of their dryness, just like the addition of excess from zegi to the unguent of diaphinicon.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most recent that is cured, it is, that you take the unguent of diaphinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and rub it on top of equal old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it with that.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it performs a similar action to this when you do not have the unguent of diaphinicon present for you, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it with that.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind everything, and powder it on top of honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then draw a thread over it on the cloth, and tie it over the sinus: and draw a thread with the honey that you cooked, until it thickens: and powder it on top of it, and put it on top of it, and tie it on.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered in the long-leaved aristolochia, and the roots of the heavenly lily, and there is a lily: and the flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple or mixed, grind them, and the mortar itself: and powder it on top of the honey that I have cooked, and use it with that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the duration of the sinus is prolonged and it is not healed by this treatment: then know that there is corruption in its depth: or already it has made an impression in the bones, or in the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what was prescribed before.

Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Paronychia is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb, or foot: and perhaps it may arise in the other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When, however, the condition persists and is neglected and treated with a hot abscess, or it rots and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it may corrupt the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is an odor of putrefaction: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore, when you are treating it, since what we said about the division does not apply to your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with a knife all the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, a cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If, however, the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh to the interior, and they begin to prick it, and they wound it: then it is necessary that you place a thin radium under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise the flesh with ease, and place on what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn, corrode, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, the corruption has already pressed into the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and remove it: for it never heals while the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see signs of corrosion and decay spreading in the finger, then cut it off at one joint, according to what was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the remaining part until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if a nail is injured by wear and tear, or by a blow: and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the affected part.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula from below upwards to the sight.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard against the cut reaching the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain and it will be a cause of additional inflammation in that location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the affected area with what alleviates pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	Indeed, the finger that grows in some people's hands may be entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail: and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or its growth is in some of the joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that grows in some joints of the finger does not move: and the one that grows at the joint of the finger may move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the cutting of the one that is entirely fleshy is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, you should cut it at its root with a flat spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of the one whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, avoid cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in the one that grows at the last joint of the finger, then you should cut into its flesh roundly up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then use a saw with one of those suitable saws for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for yourself until you are healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that occurs in the fingers is often due to birth, meaning it is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you must separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly and separate between them, or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place is consolidated as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	§ On Incising Wounds.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are veins that are not covered, thick, full of superfluous melancholic humors which occur in many parts of the body: and their greatest effect is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and suffer and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, the administrator should give a strong shaking of the body from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then bleeding of the patient through the basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron is indeed in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are dried and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other way is that the vein is raised and the whole is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The incision of it is indeed in this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, rub the leg with hot water many times until the thick bloody feces are dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the weak leg from its upper part of the hip, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then remove, that is, draw the blood out of your hand from the lower part of the leg, upwards, and from the upper part, it is necessary to bleed the sick first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail with it down to the lower part: until enough blood comes out that you see is sufficient, and as much as the strength of the sick can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and tell him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat evacuation and bleeding when the veins are filled, and it harms this sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, his bleeding is done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in a bath: or foment his leg with hot water on it, until it reddens, and the veins are full: or exercise strong exercise if there is not present a bath, until the limb is warmed.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in a straight line across the vein: or at the last of it by the knee, or in the lower part of it by the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape the vein from all parts, until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, which you see is reddening downwards to blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it goes out of the skin, you see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then immerse under it Radium, until when bled and goes out of the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then clean it with a brush and hang it up with another peg as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section or several sections if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then clean it and cut the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you remove it from the section that is above or higher with all sections until it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you in removing and cleaning: then insert a needle with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and remove it: or insert a brush under it: and turn your hand to all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, do not cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to clean it greatly, and it will cause harm on the weak from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have removed it all: then place it on the wound with a moistened cloth in wine and rose oil or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the grape is contracted, having a twisted shape to which there is an unrolling to all parts and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary to cut over it to all part of its twist and the places of its unrolling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it up with pegs until you clean it all: and beware at your cut on it that you do not cut the vein or wounds: for it will be difficult for you to clean it or remove it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, use your wisdom.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of Incision for Healing a Vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of Incision for a Blind Eye.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have curvature like other eyelids, nor is it sharp at the edges, so as not to wound the eye: and it is thick and flexible, mild: for if it were subtle, it would pierce the eye with its subtlety: indeed it should have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Leg Vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs on earthly hot lands, such as Alizaga, and the Arab lands, and in dry, hot, and few-tending lands, that is, where there is no grass or tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just like what happens inside the body with snakes and worms of ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which happens in the leg, a severe inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place is opened up.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that place of its opening, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore it appears from that end of it, then you should roll over it a fragment of lead, whose weight is from the drachma keil, up to two drachmas and the knot: and let go the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something exits from it to the outsides, roll that in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged too much, then cut off a part of it and wrap up the remaining part.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off at its root before it has fully emerged.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it off, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing an abscess, putrefaction, and a bad ulcer in that place.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently and gradually removed until it fully emerges from its last part, and nothing remains of it in the body. In some people, this vein exits in a length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it has exited from a man after twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If it happens to you during your medical treatment: then insert the needle into its opening, and pierce it through the hole with the body, until all that is in it from the matter is evacuated. And administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the wound with the treatment of the abscess.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and exits from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore care for it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ On cutting out worms that are generated under the skin, and it is called "Bouini's disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called "Bouini's disease" in a certain land among us because it often happens to worms, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the entire body, ascending and descending: and it is shown to the senses during its walking from one member to another, until it breaks down any place in the skin where it exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	Its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as it happens to worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and tapeworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from its malevolence.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it walks in the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches the place: then perhaps it opens in that, and exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done unless during its walking and appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is sunk into the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a hot iron on the place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing that is feared, is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind under it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And you must use a weak cleansing of his body, with dissolving medicines that remove foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he must guard himself from foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	§ On cutting for pain in the jaw.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This affliction is called by us in our land as "Nakir": and it is a pain that affects certain limbs, then passes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen it myself, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to an ill woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she extended her arm, and I saw inflammation of the small vein in the tendon of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for an hour, I saw one inflammation moving with a stick, like a snake, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it is like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place, and fixed itself on her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was turning around her whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed at the swiftness of its change from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed I had not seen this affliction with my eyes in that way according to this manner before that.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	But indeed I have seen many who find the pain changing from one member to another: and I have not seen it with my eyes as I saw it in that woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is, except that it is because the woman was from those who are from dry bodies' veins detected: hence therefore it appears to sense that swiftness changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate, and bodies humid, hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure her pain, and the patient feels it: then if it is appearing to you with your eye, as we said, then bind above it, and under it quickly: and dry above it, until that swiftness confined exits: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your own eyes: then care for it with body massage, and with that which expels worms, and rub it with foul-smelling powders, and powders of sappor, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows vary according to their kinds, and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	However, their variety is such: because there are some that have large and small, concave, and deaf points.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are some that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And there are some that have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And there are some that have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those that are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For indeed the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you after, then it is necessary that you follow the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For from the signs of the brain when the arrow falls into it, and penetrates the mouth, and exits that which is above the brain, is: because these things happen from it strong soda, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and permixtion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may issue forth from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white fluid like pus issues forth from the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And a similar discharge of flesh issues forth from it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from healing, and extract the arrow if it does not issue forth.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	But the signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and it feels with it as if it were itself fixed in a hard thing, not in a void.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow is similar to the motion of a blow: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And there follows a chill of the extremities, and cold sweat, and shortness of breath.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death is approaching without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is: that foamy blood runs from the wound: and the wounds following the neck swell up, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a deep, cold breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the lung, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is great panting with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food issues forth from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the bowel and sticks in it: something of feces issues forth from the wound, or a mass, or an intestine that is already broken.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope of healing him, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out from it, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the weak person: then you will know that it is a mortal wound.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, ribs, backbone, hip, and leg, and similar parts from the limbs are saved according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these arrows, to signify for your healing.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell to a man in the lacrimal duct of his eye, in the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the ear fat: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted the arrow from a Jew, which fell to him under the fat of his eye, under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not follow it except its small tip with which it sticks to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the arrows of Turks, with a weak iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no harmful event came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted the arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I followed over it between two ribs: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was subtle with her until I extracted her, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore three days had passed over him, and nothing was changed on him from his dispositions, I followed after the arrow: and I probed it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was hardened over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore it was after seven years, the arrow came out of the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was hardened over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing was changed from her dispositions, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw a man another, on whom an arrow had fallen on his face: and the wound was hardened, and it remained, not finding much pain: and similar things to these many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's principal officers, which had fallen on him in the middle of his nose, and it was already slightly declined to the right side: and the arrow was hidden entirely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called for healing after the fall of the arrow up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found the wound of the arrow very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore probed it with a thin probe, and I did not find it: and he himself found pain and pricking under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this prick was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I placed the plaster with the plaster that had the power of attraction and digestion, trusting that the abscess would form in that place, and it appeared to me to be a sign of an arrow, so I cut above it: and it did not happen that the arrow followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days: and it did not happen that the wound became worse, and the wound healed in the meantime: and he remained weak from its extraction for a period of days, until he felt the arrow inside his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore, I placed on that wound an acute and corrosive medicine for many days, until it was open: and when I probed it, and felt the delicate tip of the arrow that stuck to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the open wound that medicine, until the tip of the arrow appeared visible to us: and it passed by me with him for a period of time, approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey its exit: then I did not cease to sharpen, and invent on it with ways of ingenuity, until I began one day with well-made forceps, according to the form that they will have at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose will not be healed.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I healed it again, and the wound healed, and the sick man was healed with complete health: and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the method of extracting certain arrows: place that rule and meaning on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this craft and their distinctions are not comprehended in narration: nor does that book understand it, and a wise craftsman compares with little above much: and with what is present, he finds on that which is absent: and he discovers a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of external things of this craft when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or from the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place and is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	But if it does not obey the exit from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you let it go for several days until the flesh which is in its circumference rots: and its attraction is alleviated and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it sticks to bone, and does not obey you for exit, then let it go also for several days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not obey you for exit after days: then it is necessary that you bore through the circumference of the arrow in the bone from all parts with a fine drill until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull, and it has already proceeded into one of the cerebral ventricles, and some of those accidents appear which I said: then abstain from the attraction of the arrow and let it go until it is equal to its after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow has reached the liver, then death will not be prolonged for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow has not been fixed, unless it is only in the body of a bone and does not penetrate to the liver: and he remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents: then use your skills in the attraction of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed very firmly, and does not obey you for attraction: then give a counter-poison in the circumference of the arrow, as I have told you: then care for the wound, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow has already hidden itself in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then search for it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then draw it out with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot touch it, due to the constriction of the wound, and due to the length of the arrow in the deep place: and there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then cut over it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if there are ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh that is fixed in them from all parts, with every skill that you can, and skills, if it cannot be removed over the flesh in the fracture of the ears, and the twisting of them, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you are administering the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you make it come out: and subtle last subtleties, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot apply it to her within an hour, then let her go for several days until the affected parts around her decay.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the application: it will heal the wound. However, if it causes opposite effects on your blood flow, then administer what we mentioned in the chapter on treatment, and guard your virtue from incision of vein, nerve, or string.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer your skill in every possible way that is possible for you to avoid the arrow: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, it should be weak according to its form, as it was at the time of the arrow's wound in the same place.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	However, if it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that comes out from the other part, or already proceeds from it to the exterior: or makes stiffness of the extremity of the arrow through sense from the upper part of the skin near, and you see it projecting: then cut on it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the pincers can take in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	However, if it retains in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow hits the bone, and enlarges itself: then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let her go for several days: then repeat it until she exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	However, if the wood of the arrow is in her, then push it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however a log has fallen and you wish to administer an impulse to it, then introduce the concave instrument into it so that its concavity enters the tail of the Arrow: then strike it along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the Arrow is concave, then strike it with the entering instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The Arrow is relieved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If however the Arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to hollow out the entire flesh in which the poison is: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it with that which is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If however the Arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close to that which you touch with the thread, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and avoid from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then care for its wound, if you see it, and heal that, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the shape of the Forceps by which Arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let their extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they take hold of the Arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many shapes are made from them, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the quantity of the size of the Arrow, and its lightness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the Striking concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the Striking deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the deaf extremity like a Radius, so that its entrance into the concave Arrow is relieved, and it is struck with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this striking concave is concave like the feather of a bird: so that its entrance into the Arrow is relieved, and its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins that are customarily bled in the body are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins that are located behind the ears, called "the herbs"; and two arteries that are visible in two temples; and two veins that are located in the two lachrymal ducts of both eyes, called "the spectators"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the end of the nose.

Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins that are bled in the arms are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the cephalic vein, and it is located on the sulci side; and the people call it the "vein of the head".
Et Fusca.	And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And the middle vein is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic vein; and the people call it the "vein of the body".

Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	The people call it the "vein of the belly".
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the "brachial string" is located above the elbow; and it is the one that is bled, and it is the one that appears above the wrist with the palm facing up.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And Saluatella: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And there are three veins in the leg and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is the vein that is under the pollicis curvature from the side of the sylvestris.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphena: and its location is at the calcaneum from the side of the domestic.

Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the leg there are other three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	¶ On bleeding from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Bleeding indeed from two veins which are after the ears is a remedy for ancient catarrhs, and hemigraine, and sahafati, and old head sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bleeding it is according to what I say.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is, that the head of the sick be rubbed: and the back of his head is rubbed in the place of two veins with a rough cloth rubbing well.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the sick person will tie his neck with a string, until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are after the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel them being pricked by your finger, there mark with caustic.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a bleeding lancet, and it is the one that is called Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the bleeding lancet reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then wipe your hand with the vein and skin to the upper, and cut the vein with the Incidens cutting.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be an amount equal to two fingers of a scribe, or about that: and make it bleed as much as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with cotton, and let it go, until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now at the beginning of the book, the incision of them, and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	On bleeding two arteries in times.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Of the two arteries which are in the two times of bleeding, is a benefit to the ancient hemigram: and bad salt, and frequent ointment: and the course of the flowing sharp drops to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of bleeding them is according to what I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The sick person ties his neck a lot, until two veins appear to the sense of appearance manifest: and shows the pulse of them under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	For then the signs with the cauterizer.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein to the upper with your index finger, and insert the bleeding incoming from below, and lift the vein to the upper.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in two other veins: and make it flow out of the blood according to the amount of your need.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Regarding bleeding from the vein under the tongue after bleeding from the cephalic vein.

However, bleeding from the two veins under the tongue is beneficial: it is because bleeding from the cephalic vein is for conditions that are in the throat, and pain in the neck, and conditions of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Regarding the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are bled from in the elbow, are in which bleeding has become customary in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bleeding from them is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either pricking with a flat-tipped myrtle bleeder: or oilily to the fineness of decline: or cutting with a knife bleeder, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are species wide and fine according to the size and tightness of the veins: the shape of the myrtle bleeder should be wide, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, apparent, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	This bloodletting lancet is of lesser width and more delicate at its extreme tips.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is suitable for the vein bloodletting of delicate needles, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the bloodletting of the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basilica, which is one of these three vein bloodletting, is its jewel.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the chin and neck, from the chest and abdomen, and follows this, as a bloodletting physician with a lancet, he should be cautious and have fear of it, as under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs and adds to the bloodletting puncture, he will cut that artery, and an accident of blood flow will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary, not to bloodlet it with a sharp lancet, but to cut it with an alnasil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If it does not appear with a clear appearance of the basilica, then you should exchange it with another one, or seek some branch of it: or bloodlet in place of its arm brachial.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear and cut it with an alnasil lancet, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you wish for the bloodletting of its own, then you should before the stricture of the arm, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then sign over the place with a cauterizer, then the arm, and cut the vein with a hollow cut with an alnasil lancet, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the impact does not fall over the distance from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, with you tighten the bandage, inflation in the place that you signed with a cauterizer, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood gushing out from the phlebotomy, like a child's urine, and it is thin and red, then you know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore rush, and place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (often indeed it is cut off), then tighten the arm, and let it go: and let the weak one be cautious of its motion: and let him be on guard against his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not cut off, and it overpowers you: and there is no medicine for you present in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the boxer's corticem, and press him: take half of it, and tie it over the place of the vein neatly, with a bandage and cotton until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with him whose memory preceded from the place of dust abscinding blood flow: and cutting of his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound location, and possibility of bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On phlebotomy of the vein Black
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the veins Black phlebotomy is a benefit, which draws blood from the upper part of the head, and lower body: because it is composed of the branch Basilica, and the branch Cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to have fear of her, because beneath her is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds to the puncture and discovers a nerve, it may cause stupor in her, making her recovery difficult, and perhaps she will not be healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then you must place your phlebotomy where the phlebotomist makes the cut, with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	About the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	However, the phlebotomy of the Cephalic Vein is a remedy, because it draws blood from the head, and brings it to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, to puncture it with a phlebotomy oil lamp, or with a phlebotomy myrtle: because it is safer than all veins, since it is not beneath an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is appropriate for you with the phlebotomy to avoid with the phlebotomy the tail of the lizard, and seek a gentler spot: and it does not harm him, if it is not found with the first blow, to repeat the phlebotomy on her several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess forms in some people when it is not punctured in the first blow, but it does not harm him that abscess in some place.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	About the Usefulness of Phlebotomy, and Precautions to be Observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of bloodletting and its accidents depend on the correction of which you must think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Therefore, the first thing you should know about bloodletting is that it is not administered unless for the preservation of health, its continuity, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that bloodletting may be performed on one of the three veins in the arm, namely the cephalic, fusca, and basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that bloodletting may be performed at the beginning of spring on fasting, in the spring, and in summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, bloodletting that is administered in illnesses does not have a determined time; but when convenience and necessity prompt it, at night or during the day, and in every hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not proper for children to undergo bloodletting until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman undergo bloodletting, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And the elderly who have already crossed sixty years should not undergo bloodletting.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to undergo bloodletting for any reason, it is proper that they clean their intestines before bloodletting with a mild enema if there is much feces retained in them: so that the veins at the time of bloodletting do not draw out from the intestines harmful superfluities which are noxious to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient with toctina, that is, nauseous satiety, undergo bloodletting, nor one who has overeaten, nor one who is trying to avoid drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor is the weak one with hydrocephalus.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bleeding should be avoided again after colic pain, vomiting, diarrhea, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, and sleeplessness, and fasting, and everything that dissolves strength from the body or the animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to have that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should take a bath, if nothing prohibits him: or he should be exercised with some exercise, so that the blood becomes subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place bleeding on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and try to evacuate his chest that day from all animal misfortunes: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily misfortunes, such as labor, and punishment, and superfluousness, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his seat be made to have the presence of those things with which he became accustomed to use from the custom of men from aromaticity, and perfuming, and dancing and similar things by the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bleeder should sit on a litter, which is higher than the litter for bleeding: then he should draw his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie a ligature with a bandage, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be temperate, because when the binding is unequal, or by excess in the binding, then it prevents the course of the blood: or in the softening, then also it prevents the course of the blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding, it is necessary to rub the bleeder with his hands simultaneously, until the veins swell, and declare themselves to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then, the phlebotomist washes the phlebotomy site with a little oil, as is proper and ancient.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then, he places his index finger of his left hand on the vein, under the spot where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the vein does not escape, and the blow is contained.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For since the veins are like a slippery cord when you find them at phlebotomy: and from them is what is full of pliability: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is tight: therefore for this reason it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should lay down the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein opens from one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that side in another place slightly, or above it with haste: if the spot does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it becomes inflamed, or the patient is weak, then let him go on the day, or in two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the abscess will attract heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And he should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the phlebotomy, if he likes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly: and you fear that not enough blood will come out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste, before the spot becomes inflamed, for an inflamed spot is in many people at small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that it is already suppurating, then do not press on it at all, for nothing excuses it in your eyes.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something oily on it: for it will soothe the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the oil in all your phlebotomies, where the phlebotomist prohibits the course of the blood: and they make it tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when it is placed on one of them on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if an abscess occurs in the place of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to those who are not phlebotomized except at that time, or is a small opening of the vein, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt on the spot, heated for a while: and bind it for an hour: for it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its own supplement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	But if something remains in the spot after a few days, black or green, it does not harm it: and if you wish, place something aloe, or myrrh solutes on it: or something from the juice of menthastr, that is, calamint or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	But often indeed abscesses and boils occur at the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand on it, then if you find softness at your compression on it, then that boil is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore beware, so that you place something from what we said on it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But apply a plaster to it with the one that has astringency, so that the wound is hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the other cure until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract all blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color staining on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out, until it turns red: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out, until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, to increase the venipuncture, and to be on the left side: and in him who is weak, the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it at certain times, and that there be a narrow opening: and better what is administered in bloodletting from the vein is that it be transverse section, not puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to arrive at bloodletting with syncope, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting a little bread soaked in water of pomegranate: or secaniba if he is hot: and extract him from the blood in three times, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then he should take before bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of myrrh, or in syrup of honey aromatized with species, or in aromatic syrup fragrant.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If a case of syncope occurs among phlebotomists, and the cause is the escape of blood, then it is necessary for them to take a drink of meat water and odoriferous syrup: and they should use aromatics with algalia, and bandage their chest with that: and they should use the other things we mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But if someone wants to evacuate their arm and dissolve their blood secondarily: it is necessary for them whose phlebotomy is for evacuation of much blood, and whose virtue is weak, that they dissolve the blood gradually by the amount of virtue in consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But if someone wants to evacuate their arm and dissolve their blood secondarily, and their body is strong: then they should do it after seven hours, or nine from their first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But if someone wants to draw blood from their body towards the opposite part of which they lean: it is necessary for them to evacuate on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and makes fever to happen: it is necessary for the blood to come out of it in one draft, and a large amount to be drawn from it: and the opening should be enlarged until syncope happens: after you have been preserving all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand on the vein during the course of the blood, so that death does not happen in the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often this happens when the phlebotomist does not know, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to evacuate the arm, and dissolve the blood secondarily, when the opening of the vein has already been closed, and difficult exit of the blood is made, that it be applied with force, and extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, but let it go until he is bled again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the bleeding needle that which has coagulated from the blood in the vein opening, and place on it something dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it something from the Tyrian alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with gentle compression until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if indeed the vein has already become an abscess, then let it go, and do not cover it until the abscess is formed.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity provokes to solve the blood again, and there is no excuse, then either with the bleeding needle above that place, or in the other arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the arm's vein is bled at the place of the Fuscus and Basilica, when they are not found, and they are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its bleeding is that the sick hand enters into hot water, until it reddens easily, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is tied above it with a small bandage in the middle compression.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the bleeding needle is done according to transversal, not latitudinal, nor according to the length: and it is a wide opening, and your bleeding is above the joining of the hand for a moment.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the exit of the blood is forbidden, then repeat the hand in hot water, and let the blood run in the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you will be excused from repeating the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Indeed, very much is placed on the course of the blood in hot water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	This bloodletting from this vein is safer than all other veins, since there is no pulsating vein nor nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Indeed, the bloodletting from the Salute's right hand is beneficial for the liver's ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this bloodletting is such that you should tie the vein with a ligature or with your hand, after you have inserted it into warm water, until the vein is filled and the sensation is very strong.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, the bloodletting is to be performed by puncturing.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you puncture it entirely, it will not harm her in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And save, do not use your last hand with the bloodletting instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat with your hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise, you must do with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The remedy for this bloodletting from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for the ailments of the spleen; and likewise do in its bloodletting, as you did in the second one, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The remedy for the bloodletting of the saphenae is: for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments, retention of menstruation, kidney weaknesses, and old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar from ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of the bloodletting is such that the sick person should put his foot in warm water and perform friction on it until the veins are full, then tie above the ankle with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	The veins are indeed located at the heel, visible towards the big toe, and branch out from there into many branches in the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, perform bloodletting in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its collection, as it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If bloodletting is performed on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your bloodletting where the bloodletting comes out of the transuvers, as if you wanted to cut it: and let the bloodletting be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the exit of blood is forbidden, then repeat the foot in warm water: and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the bloodletting needle misses the vein in the first attempt, then repeat the bloodletting with blood to the upper part for a little, as it is a safe place, and you do not fear harm from it when you avoid the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the other equal Saphena of the foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the veins of the Sciatica are, as we said, located at the heel on the side of the wood.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the relief of bloodletting from it is for pain in the ankle, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of bloodletting from it is that the sick person should enter the bath quickly and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, with a thin long bandage, for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it is apparent, then perform a phlebotomy on it according to whatever method is possible for you, or by transection: and it is better, or that you cut it with an incision, or separate it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is hidden greatly in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it is not apparent at all to the senses: then perform a phlebotomy on some of its branches, and that one which appears in the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and make it bleed a quantity of blood as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then dissolve the constriction, and place the skin on the location of the phlebotomy, and tie the location.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it is healed quickly there.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ Of Ventilation, and its quality of use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilations are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation is indeed made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without scarification, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it is indeed with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And those ventilations which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen locations of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the ventilation of Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the ventilations of Alhagdahim, and they are two layers of the neck from two parts at once: and the ventilation of the mind, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the ventilation of two spatulas: and the ventilation of Alachosos on the end of the tail: and the ventilation of two forks, and they are in the middle of two arms: and the ventilation of two legs: and the ventilation of two wings.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And wind suction does not draw blood from your wounds that are spread thinly in the flesh, and for this reason its power does not remain, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to apply wind suction whether with fire or without fire in any ailment that arises from overfullness until the entire body has been emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity provokes wind suction from the ailment or because of custom, we apply it at every hour in the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Which is because there are people who when blood multiplies in them until they need its extraction by wind suction, find heaviness and pain in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them is found overfullness and redness in their face, on their head, and on their neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them is found itching in their face, and on their forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them is found sweating at the place of their wind suction.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them is found whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them is found whose tongue has a taste of blood: or their tongue swells and vomiting blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them is found whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them is found who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and killed people, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something from them, and if it is properly in the middle of the month: we command then for wind suction to be done after they have passed two or three hours past midday.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The bandage for ventosation of the ankle is as follows: since it contributes to heaviness in the head and that which is poured out affects the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	Indeed, it should be after complete evacuation of the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed a place for cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it for those who are of cold constitution or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for that reason, it is not allowed to use it for the elderly or in whose head there are cold ailments.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But those who become accustomed to it, become drowsy on it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason, you should command the ventosator to lay his hand with the ventosa briefly on the lower parts, fearing the generation of drowsiness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel is a place for phlebotomy of the femoral vein, and phlebotomy of the basilic vein, and for that reason it brings asthma, and constriction of breathing, and cracking of the instrument of breathing, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be pushed slightly upward, because if it is placed lower, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation of alhagdahim brings pain from accidental headaches, and obtalmiae, and hemigraneae, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is a place for phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should command the ventosator not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not pierce the artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventilation under the chin, applies alcohol to the mouth, and prevents corruption of the jaw, and similar things from discomforts that are in the mouth: and it stands in place of phlebotomy, which are in two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventilation with spoons, applies to the alchefachem, which is made from folding and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	True ventilation of the two internal parts of the forearm, applies to the bandage of phlebotomy of three veins, Basilicae, and Fuscae, and Cephalicae: because it attracts blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins attract from other larger veins, until the attraction reaches three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you command the Ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification: because the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The ventosator that ventilates on the buttocks, applies to hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you command the Ventosator to be large and made of air: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the thin ventosators are broken: and scarification is done with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The ventosators of the legs reduce the manifest diminution: because they attract blood from the whole body, and apply to old pains in the kidneys, and matrix, and bladder: provoke menstruation, and apply bothor, and ademenul: and stand in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenar veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body a lot, and cause syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The remedy for the wound of a horse's neck is close to the remedy for the wound of two horses' legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position for the wound is that you should place the horse in a first empty stall and suck the wound with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the wounds, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal advent: and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already red and inflated, and the appearance of blood redness: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the position of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For if it is a person of tender flesh, of rare pore, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: so that the place does not hurt.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the horse to enlarge the scarification and to puncture a little: and regulate suction with ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first juice indeed the way is opened to the subtle thinning of the blood and its moistening: and in the second indeed the thorough investigation of the exact extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then make the third scarification: so that it follows the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract blood gradually or a little, one scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want many extractions of blood, we will scarify with multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that you scarify with deep scarifications: and the end equal in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that thing that must be administered from oils at the position of the Wind-pipes, and what should one be cautious of when applying it?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is rough, hard, dark, and its pores are tightly closed, it is necessary to anoint the Wind-pipe areas with oils that are open, gentle, and resolving: if it is in the time of summer, such as the oil of alkermes, or the violent oil, or the oil of sweet apricot kernels, or the oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of camomile, or the sarbatinum: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if the excess is rough, cold: then the oil should be myrrh, or the oil of balsam, or the white oil, or the oil of anise: and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	But if the Wind-pipe is of large pores, and of tender flesh: then it is necessary to prohibit oil, and it is necessary for them to wash the Wind-pipe areas after application with rosewater, or with cold water, or with water of the comforter, or with water of cucumber, or with water of portulaca: and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But that person whose blood is of much moisture, they should wash the Wind-pipes with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumach: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But that person whose excesses are rough, they should wash their Wind-pipes with old wine, or with water of sambucus, or the decoction of anise, or of chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be cautious of Wind-pipe application in the bath, or at the edge of the bath: indeed it is necessary to administer after exiting from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	It is not necessary for someone to sleep after a nosebleed.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What should be done before a nosebleed to control it or to have it bled by a phlebotomist?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	Then, after the nosebleed, it is important to consider whether the person was bled or had a nosebleed beforehand. If they were choleric, the sharpness and inflammation in their blood will be increased. In this case, they should take cooling substances such as pomegranate rind, and also eat aceto (vinegar) with lettuce, secania (a type of herb), and julep (a sweetened drink) regularly.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And give them foods such as chicken eggs and cooked meats, and condiments with agreste (a type of herb).
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	If their constitution is cold, they should drink a syrup made from honey, almonds, or secania seeds, and also take a medium-strength aromatic wine that is between old and new. They should also be advised to eat little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And give them foods such as chicken eggs and canebir (a type of herb), and also small birds, that is, sparrows, and the young of doves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And they should drink more than they eat on the day of the nosebleed and bloodletting. In some people, it is recommended to give them a drink made from tyriaca alfaroch (a type of herb), or a medicine made from musk (a type of perfume), or aleselith (a type of herb) before the nosebleed, or after bloodletting, to strengthen their main limbs and thin their blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	They should not drink it hot.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On nosebleeds without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Ventosae, which are without incision, are placed on the parietal, spleen, podagra, abdomen, umbilicus, and renal areas, as well as the perineum and anchored peg: because these parts do not tolerate incisions made upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought through these, except for attachment of blood from a limb to a limb: such as we place a ventosae on the breasts in the case of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to dissolve the cold ventosities that have formed in a limb due to freezing: such as we place a ventosae on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For indeed, they rarefy the limb, and warm it, and remove pain because they have dissolved that ventosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	They are also placed on the kidneys when there is a stone or rock in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For perhaps by virtue of their attraction they may open the obstruction, or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly, when it is placed on the parietal and spleen in both places where ventosity needs to be drained from them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventosae are administered empty with only a small incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleurisy: and this is that the ventosae be filled with warm water alone, or with water in which herbs have been boiled that are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a ventosae administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its mouth be two open fingers, according to how we have shaped it: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side in the place that is approximately in the middle of it, a small hole, according to the size that enters it: let it be made of air simultaneously, or citrine, coarse margin, linen, equal, clean: so that it does not hurt the limb at its position on top of it: and let there be in the middle of it a transverse rod from air, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this sponge becomes very large and much larger than we have described, and somewhat smaller than the one we mentioned, according to his illness and age who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For boys and those who are thin, other sponges are used, which are not as large as those for men and people with thick bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of applying this sponge with fire to a limb is that you should light the linen with fire from flax cloth properly, or a small candle from earthenware: and place it on the middle of the transverse strip which is in the middle of the sponge, so that the fire may be applied to the lower part of the sponge, so as not to burn the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the limb: and the finger is on the hole that I mentioned, until we hold the sponge: while we need it, we remove the finger, and the steam comes out through that hole, and the sponge dissolves immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then again with fire according to its proper amount, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the sponge that is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse strip, nor hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this sponge, the larger it is, the better it can hold much water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the hanging of Sanguisugarum.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae are not administered in many places, except in those limbs where it is impossible to place the sponges, due to their size, such as the lip, and the gum, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and the nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	The quality of their use is: that they come from bloodsuckers which are in sweet waters, clean from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be released during the day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body will be evacuated first with phlebotomy, and with ventosis.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe away the weak member, until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, they will be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled and fall, and suction of the location with ventosis is possible, then it is more appropriate for healing: and if not, then wash the location with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rub, and express it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood continues after the death of bloodsuckers, and it is dripping: then pour cold water into linen cloth, and place it on top, until the dripping is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder on top of it zeig tritum, or galls, and similar to them from stiptics: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they are placed on top of the location of peeled beans: and they are released, until the beans stick in the location, because the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if necessary is repetition of bloodsuckers, when it is possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if bloodsuckers are prevented from suspension, then wash the location with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or put clay in locations, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, because they when feel something from the blood, stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall out, sprinkle some powdered aloe, salt, or ash on them, and they will fall out immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on the restoration, dislocation, and cure of sprains, and similar cases.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones that have occurred by accident.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that fools among physicians and the common people, and those who have never examined an ancient book nor read a letter from it, boast of this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is private in our earth's sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never benefited from it at all, and I have not acquired that which I have acquired except through the length of reading ancient books, and the study beyond their understanding, until I extracted knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to it by experiment and study throughout my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you in this chapter all that it contains of my knowledge: and on what my experiment has passed over, after I have abbreviated it for you, and relieved it from the burden of length, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections from the fact of bone fractures, from those that are necessary to be mentioned before we begin the memory of the limbs of the broken and diverse, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary for us to say in the prologue of this chapter, the main terms and headings, about which understanding requires the craftsman to be at a position above their truth: namely, so that you and those who are ready know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to someone a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or accident: then it is necessary to go quickly in the first place to bleed him, and to solve him, or both at once, if something does not prohibit it, such as weakness of strength: or he is that to whom something happens from those boys, or old man decrepit: or is time of very hot heat, or very cold cold greatly.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cool herbs, and meat of birds, and sheep: and prohibit wine, and coarse meat, and filling from food and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the hot abscess, and does not fear the effusion of matter to the member: then the sick one should return to his first regimen with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore when he begins to restore his broken jaw, then it is necessary for the sick one to be fed with nutritious food in great quantity, coarse, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of suckling animals, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar to those.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the fracture is coagulated faster, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that it is impossible for broken bones in men who are in their prime and the elderly to always be united and consolidated according to their natural form, due to the dryness of their members: and those which are from them at the end of the period of healing are consolidated and united like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature connects something similar to glue to the broken bone from all parts, in which there is thickness, which adheres and binds it, until they are united and bound together again, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until something does not prevent it from performing its functions: and for this reason it is necessary to place nourishment for the weak foods, in which there is heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the appearance of fractures is different, according to the diversity of the members: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull: and the fracture of the ribs is different from the fracture of the backbone: and similarly all other members exist differently one from another: and I come with the remembrance of all the species of fractures exposed in their respective chapters, distinct from one another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of fracture of bone are also diverse in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is broken into a curved shape, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes the fracture of it is according to the length of the bone: and its splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with a wound and tearing in the head: and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own proper talent or instrument for its restoration, according to how it will come back into memory, distinguished in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that a bone fracture is known, its twist and elevation are also known; and its appearance to the sense and the sound when you grasp it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no twist apparent in the place, nor a sound at your touch when you grasp the bone with agitation, and you do not find a weak great pain: then it is not a fracture, but possible that there is a twist or small fissure. Therefore, it does not need to be moved with your hand and completely compressed, indeed put on top of it from the medicines, of which its memory comes after the moment that fits the place: then it is bound tightly with a thin bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is bent and split into two, besides what happens to it, indeed all part is removed from its comparison: then you should begin with your hour to correct it, equalizing it before it happens to it hot abscess.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for several days until the abscess is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whatever manner can from alleviation and talent.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than bone in which happen afflictions.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what comes to you memory of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are afflictions in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if hand is, or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be where you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the member are extended: then try, that you make those additions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever manner you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest any pain or injury occur through your operation, and try according to your strength, that you apply one of two bones with its partner, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that hour, you must attempt and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and make it equal by the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of strong extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often they cause to occur through that operation of theirs a hot abscess, or contraction in the member: as we have already seen that often from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then after the equaling and decent operation, and the binding of that member, and its quietness, and tranquility: and warn the weak one on it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware, that he not move it in his own hours of wakefulness, and his sleep at its revolution, and its agitation, and its excretion, and all its movements with his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware, that the position of the member be not a position with which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain in the position of the member, or injury: then it is necessary, that he change it to another position from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And beware with him, that that position be equal, straight: so that no twisting occur in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	The quality of the constriction of the broken limb, as I have described it.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken limbs vary in their size, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, for those that are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the little finger, and similar to them, it is necessary that the wrapping of the soft cloth should be thin and delicate.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But for those that are large, such as the thigh, and the leg, it is necessary that the wrapping should be wide and hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligament connects the large limb and binds it from all sides evenly, so that it does not enter it with a stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation, you should place a suitable plaster on it, in soft wool over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then you should wrap the ligament over the place of the fracture itself with three or four bandages, according to what the limb deserves: and press your hand slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and press less than your previous binding, which you bound the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the bandage away from the place of the fracture slightly, and soften the constriction gradually, until you take out a large piece from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another clean bandage, and wrap it again over the place of the fracture with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the bandage to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation should be in the constriction of the bandage and its softening, according to what we said in the first upper bandage.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the folds of a soft cloth or cloth, with which you will equalize the crookedness of the fracture, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, you will not place anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then fold over another cloth on top of it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, quickly place small, well-made stars on top of these folds, if there is no inflammation or heat in the wound.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflammation or an abscess in it, then place on top of it what will sit on that abscess and remove the inflammation, and let it be left for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie over it then the stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the flat parts of a cane, smoothly shaped, wisely formed: or they should be made from the wood from which brushes are made, that is, from pine, or gerade, that is, from the branches of a palm tree, or calingi: and the size of all stars should be according to this form, and the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star that is placed on top of it should be a little thicker and wider than the other stars: and the length of the star should be according to what can be tolerated by the limb from its size and strength.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie over the stars with another cloth, according to the first tie.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over it with threads wisely, as we said about the first tie: and it is so that your tie should be above the place of the fracture more: and the further it is from the fracture, the less the tie.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of foolish people who use their own threads made from twisted linen ropes, there is a great mistake: because the tie falls off with them outside of quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads no longer come together: for you will not obtain through a narrow opening that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	It is not necessary for it to be between the stars and the stars less than a finger's width.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	But if the weak one is injured through the extremities of the stars after the narrow opening in healthy places: then place under them from the soft wool, or the dyed wool, until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption occurs in the skin, I will come with remembrance of it in the chapter according to singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Which is, because the limb when it is large, does not need to be placed above it stars, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of hot pus.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, which the ancients placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ The common method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children: because it is from that which does not bind with heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the dust of the mill, and is the marrow of the flour which hangs in the walls of the mill near the moving millstone: and make it thus, except that you grind it with the shell: and place the confection of it not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	¶ Another method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take ammonium, and laudanum, and acacia, and enulae, and mugath: and suc, of each ana ʒ X myrrhae, and both aloes ana ʒ V and alethil ʒ XX they are all ground, and ground with the shell: and mixed with water alethil: or with the shell if the constitution of the weak is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it heals broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also heals fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, mess, and tall white lilies, of each ana ʒ X myrrh, and both kinds of aloes ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX, they should all be ground thoroughly, sieved, and made into a paste with water, or egg white: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of plaster for joining broken bones and separating them from their places: and it soothes the pain caused by them, and the crack in the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take shredded wool, and immerse it in vinegar, and boiled oil: and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	In this plaster there is no power of healing, but it is good for soothing hot abscesses: and it expels pain properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of plaster, which heals a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of wild figs and sycamore: and grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of shortened plaster, administered for the healing of broken bones: and when you want the resolution of remaining abscesses.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of tall lilies, and chamomile, and flowers of violets, and flour of herbs, of each ana partem unam: they should all be ground, and made into a paste with wine, if there is not a heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If indeed it is heated, then make that with water of coriander wet, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	This is another method of preparing a plaster for the more forceful resolution of a hard abscess that occurs during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for the roots of althea, and the seeds of linseed, and balm, and melilot, and savory, and violets, and chamomile, all in equal parts, grind them all, and mix with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the member, and the peacefulness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that a poultice should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, unless it is made of a clay and oil: nothing else: and he said that it should be between the thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, saw that things should be placed on the broken member during its restoration, in which there is a drying out of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	This is the method of preparing a plaster that brings together an injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for mugwort, and chickpeas, and human hair cuttings, or the feathers of a bird, and althea, and equal parts of salt: grind them all, and sift them, and make into a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the amount that is necessary, so that it remains a bandage, then dissolves, is such that you should consider at that time, if there does not occur to the sick pain, nor itching, nor moves the broken bone from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however it happens to him in the place of intense itching, or pain that does not quiet down, or inflation: then hurry, and dissolve it in the hour itself, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth, or a mild sea sponge, wet: and immerse it in warm water, and wash with it the place, until the itching is quieted, and the pain sits.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it a piece of linen soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and tie it overnight, until you are secure from the hot abscess, and let the inflation of the member rest, and the pain be removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to the tight bandage and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first tight binding, and the thin ones with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflation, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you need a plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did in the first place equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of those things happen to the member that we said, then do not unbind it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is unbound for twenty days all of that, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as we said, until when the fracture sticks, and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: also add at that time in the bandage more than your first binding entirely: and also add at that time in the feeding of the sick, according to what preceded the remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already dried up, and wasted more than it should be: then know that nourishment is prevented from coming to it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore foment it with warm water at every place where you unbind it, and let it be in all three days, and slightly loosen the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation nourishment comes to the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the stupid restorers do from the fracture of the member, when it is not restored in the first place, according to what ought to be, and is restored according to its tortuosity, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, they would say that in their books, and have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of that among them at all, and it is indeed better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the formation of an accidental deformity in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fractures are diverse, and their shapes are many, and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For a fracture is that which is caused by a blow with an axe: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone, just like an ax in wood: and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a sword cuts off something from a bone, and it cuts its face, and the cut does not penetrate to the very end of it: and this type of fracture is called Kalgan, that is, Luxation absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And a fracture is that which is crushing or grinding: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or something similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the periosteum, which is beneath the bone: or it is in the face of the bone: and this wound is of two fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And a fracture is that which is hidden in the bone in its fineness of hair: and it is a small crack, and because of this, this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture that is caused by an accident, or by a blow with a stone, and similar things that make the lamina of the bone enter into its interior, and it becomes a hollow in that place: just like what happens to copper pots when they are hit, and part of them enters into their interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	This is especially true for the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	All these species of fractures have separate treatments, and I will return with a remembrance of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these species of fractures by examining them, and inquiring about them with probes, and removing the rotten flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of capillary fracture is known by this, that it is scraped over the bone, and cleaned, and smeared with cauterizer on top: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, first consider the symptoms of the infirm person: then if you see from the symptoms that it clearly indicates great fear, such as vomiting cholera, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and exit of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar symptoms in many positions, undoubtedly he is not cured: and if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for salvation, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if he comes to you wounded in the first place with his wound: and this is in winter days, then it is necessary for you to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every position.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary for you to quickly remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the bandage rots, and those symptoms occur that we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached the bandage touching the brain, and it is with minutiae, and attraction: then it is necessary for you to cut the part that is broken and worn, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, to cut the head of the wounded: and uncover over the mouth as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If however it happens to you at the detection of bone bleeding blood, or hot abscess: then place it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, to fill the place with infused cloths in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess sets, and you are secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, to cut the bone with a strict-bladed incisor: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Another method is, to administer another incisor after the first one a little further: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer another incisor even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of incisors of different kinds: some of which are wider to some, and some of them shorter to some: and they are in the last extremity of their sharpness, and they are made of iron, or fuled: and use ease in percussion on the incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and it does not hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary, that you pierce in the circumference of it, before you administer incisors, with drills called Terebra not deepening: and they are not so called, because they do not pass beyond the end of the fleshy part to that, which is after it: because Terebro is the round extremity on top of it, which is under the sharp head, similar to the edge, and a small circle prevents submerging, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to receive from these drill bits a large number, each of which corresponds to the thickness and density of the bone, until you have in your possession every skull drill: whose sharpness in length and brevity should correspond to the thickness and density of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	This is the form of three kinds of drills, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around a broken bone is as follows: you should place the drill on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another location, and place what is between all the holes in the thickness of the radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisor that is between all the holes from the bone: and make it as thin as possible above that from the end of its lightness, as we said, until you remove the roots of the bone, or by your hand, or with some other instruments which you have prepared for that: such as delicate shears and forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to guard the eyes with every caution, lest the drill or incisor touch anything from those.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you are drilling the bone and it has been separated from those, if it is continuous with that, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to cut, and equal the extremity of it which remains in the bone with another similar incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything small and brittle from the bones, then take it with facility, with that which is at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with bandages and ointments which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of surgery is easy and very far from fear: which Galen spoke of and praised it greatly: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you to first begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and more obvious: until when you have uncovered that part, and have placed the extremity of this lens-shaped incisor under it, whose form is as follows.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part does not cut anything: and the sharp part of it on both sides of it advancing in length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is leaning against the bone, with its sharp part facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the incisor from one side with a small mallet, until you have cut through the whole bone with ease, as it revolves: and you will be secure from the cloth, that nothing accidental will happen to it, which you fear absolutely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the doctor were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, and not asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off from it with the extremity of this lens-shaped incisor, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its face, and there remain in it roughness and fine scratches: then you must smooth that roughness, and eradicate those fine scratches with fine rasps from which you prepared a variety of different quantities, so that it may be possible for you to apply to them in every suitable place and more rectangular and rectified forms, according to what leads you to the operation, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that administrators in your ratio, where in the first place the root's mouth, more widely than those sharpeners.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after him with a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you reach administering thinner and finer than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining cracks, hair-thin, and fine fracture, it is necessary that you administrator care, according to that which leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a matter which does not hide over all, to whom in this art there is anything study, and it has stood above that which we wrote, and showed in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if the cloth is detected to retain when you eradicate the root: then it is necessary that you take the cloth linen, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it on top of the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled, or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first cloth: and make it as easy as possible on top of that, so that it does not weigh down with it.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above it the wide bandage: and do not tie it, unless by the quantity which holds the wound only: and let it go with this care on one day, or two days, until you are secure from hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after that medicines with which is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lilies, and flour of herb, and powder of turpentine, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is, that you make from these medicines powder, which is powdered on the wound as are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	Universally apply this medicine to that area for its property to soothe and not to bite or cause pain.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And cauterize according to your skill, so that the wound in your treatment is clear: neither is there any dirt from the ointment, nor filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not release the virus to gather in that area at all: for when the virus gathers on the brain cloth, it corrupts it and rots it, and brings great harm upon the weak after that: and now it happens in the head, when the mouth is cleaned by it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if such things happen to the weak as we have said, know that it is certainly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then you must take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and linen cloth with it.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the head: afterwards care for it with the species of cures that come together, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of the nose when it breaks.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except from its two upper parts at once, or one of them: because it is two bones: for below it is cartilaginous, it does not break, and nothing happens to it except wear and tear, and twisting, and swelling.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert a small finger into the nostril, and equal that break with your index finger and thumb bent, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with skill and ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest that pain of yours occur through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach that finger: then it is necessary to equalize the end of the radius, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in two parts, then do the same as that: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the heat of abscesses, in quiet.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the end of the nose a linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two linen cloths if the fracture is in two parts: and let the swelling be of such quantity that it fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient healers said that linen cloths should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	But that does not seem to me, rather it is necessary, that the linen cloth be soaked in white of egg, completed with flour of mill.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go the linen cloth, until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes hard.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose quill is introduced into the place of the linen cloth, after it has been covered with a soft cloth: and it is made that it holds the nasal fracture more strongly, and that it does not hinder the sick person from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this matter is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, make linen cloths.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if it happens to the nose again while you are operating on the abscess, nose plasters with lead, or with cotton dissolved in rose oil, or with a little from dayquilion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a plaster made with flour of sesame, and a powder of frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft bandage on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary to cut through them and remove them with the tools that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then close the cut with a suitable ointment or plaster to heal and solidify it.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If, however, a wound occurs between the nose and the nostril, then it is necessary to close it with lint and give a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	CONCERNING THE RESTORATION OF THE LOWER JAW, WHEN IT IS BROKEN
Caput V.	CHAPTER 5
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe whether the fracture is deformed only and not broken into two pieces, and treat it to the interior: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right jaw, then insert the index finger of the left hand into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push the roughness of the fracture outward with your other hand from the interior part of the bone properly and evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply extension from both parts according to the straightness until it is possible to make an even match.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, the teeth have already been moved or broken, then tie them with gold, silver, or thread wire.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a broken leather bandage on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double piece of cloth on top of it, and place a large well-made starry (asterism) shape on the cloth: or an equal piece of skin from the sole of the foot, in the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how the bandage of that is prepared for you, and its application suits him, until it does not destroy: and instruct the sick person to use it with tranquility and quietness: and place his drinks gently.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you estimate that something is already changing the shape by some means: then hurry, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been changed from it, and make plasters of it from the flour of the millstone, with egg white, or with sisami flour, after you have removed the leather bandage: and place a soft cloth on the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore it remains attached to that plaster on top of it, and the disposition of the bone is not changed, leave it, so that it does not dissolve, until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For often this fracture is bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if meanwhile a warm abscess occurs, then administer what we said often in the sedation of it, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now the fragment is separated from the bone, or from the splint: then carefully remove you in this, so that you take those fragments of the splint with it which suit you in the removal of them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the wound opening is tight, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed that stitching, and nothing remains from it, smear the wound opening, if it is large: and if not, place on top of it an emplaister that is suitable for that, and let it heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the breastbone, when it is broken:
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The breastbone is most often broken from the front part on the side of the arm, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways:
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For indeed it is broken and separated into two, except that some stitches may occur in it: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or rather, so that something happens to the bone of the stitches: and it is more difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or rather, so that there is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And operation in it when the fracture is without a wound, is, that you make present to be two assistants, that one of them holds the instrument that follows the broken breastbone, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equal the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what it should be: and there should not be in it prominence, nor concavity.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the weak sphere of the infirm a ball from cloth, or wool: and its size should be according to the amount of your necessity: and extend, and raise the breastbone, and cut the ball by your hand, until it is equal the fracture, according to what it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the breastbone to the outside: because it reaches deep: then it is necessary that the infirm be bent over their shoulder: and place under their arm a pillow in size, and press the assistant's arm to the lower parts, until the breastbone that is in deep is raised upwards: and then correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a fracture in the coccyx and it moves, then it is necessary to make an incision over it and extract the broken coccyx with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use your skills in making an incision on it with one of the prepared incisors, after you have placed the tool that will hold the fracture under the coccyx. This tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is shaped like a spatula without a hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	Its width should be according to the size you need from the size and shape of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	It should have two ends, as you see: one wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the wound that you cut when extracting the fractured bone is wide and you want to prevent infection, then gather two flaps of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	If the fracture is small and you fear infection, then fill the wound with cloths and powder according to the size of the cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If infection occurs, then pour cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stitching of the bone when there is no wound and no cut is made by placing a plaster made from flour and egg white on the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft bandage over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its tip if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the reamer, that is, the drill used by the Saracens, which should be long and wide: its width should be the size of one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled-over sponge on the gauze and apply the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thin, flexible plate, whose width is three finger widths, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the plate in the location of the injury that falls over the fracture and the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bandage over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it around his neck, and under the healthy tongue, and under the unhealthy tongue: and reduce it to all parts, and as you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly: and this is what should not be hidden from you, and everything, so that the gauze does not move above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you should look at the unhealthy one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, when the ligament is softened, and you see the gauze is already moving: then correct it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's pillow on his back, and place under his tongue, in his sleep at night, a small sponge, so that when he is lifted up, his helper is raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the backbone is therefore raised by the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not release the ligament, if it does not occur in the place of accident from scratching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then reapply the plaster, if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in the bandage, and let him go, until he is restored and congeals.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the backbone is indeed bound and strengthened as much as possible in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some men in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Translation: "Of the Restoration of Fractured Spoons.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	It rarely breaks the spoon, and not in its wide place; and only the edges of it are not broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when it breaks from that place and in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then according to what is the figure of the fracture, try its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it back to its natural shape in every way possible, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place it on the millstone's floury place with egg white, and with wool, and place above it a thin layer of cloth doubled over.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on top of it a wide shallow dish from thin board according to the amount of the spoon all over, or a little larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if indeed there is a hollow in any place of the spoon under the dish, then make it equal with soft wool until the dish goes down according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it above with strong adhesive tape, with a proper constriction and strength of the dish, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage on every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage is softened, bind it, and make the dish equal if it is moved from its place: and let the weak one lie on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spoon indeed will be restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	Therefore when this number is completed, then dissolve the bandage: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from the bones whose union is not to be feared, nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, it proceeds from the bone fragment and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the break of the collarbone from the suppression of abscesses with heat, if anything comes from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a broken chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed break very much, and are crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which inclines to the lower parts, and pain and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps vomit blood, and the concavity in the bone fractured is not hidden from sensation, Its restoration is that it should bend itself weakly on its back: and place between its spatulas a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press its shoulders, and gather its ribs from both parts or sides with hands: and adjust in its balance, according to every mode as much as possible and it suits, until it returns the shape of the bone, according to what it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place on it a plaster and bandage, and place above it a star from thin board of willow, or of cherry, and from them similar in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust in binding it above the broken bone, so that it is not removed: and go with the bandage according to its roundness several times, and bind it tightly with a suitable tension.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage in every hour, and as often as it becomes soft, bind it: and if necessity of it provokes its solution at pruritus, or corrosion which happens in place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and solve it, and remove the plaster, and correct what happens with mode of cure of it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster if you see that face: and attach it to a bandage until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the Restoration of Noses, When They are Broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that the fracture of the noses does not occur except in places that follow the back, and from the ends of them from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them, except for that reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense with the fingers in examination.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is made so that the same fracture with fingers according to the possible mode, until it is equal to the figure, as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plasters, and bandage the broken bone with a splint, if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the noses is inclined to the insides: then it happens to the weak pain, and puncture, as that puncture which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also to him it happens difficulty of breathing, and cough, and vomiting of blood: and this is difficult of cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have been skillful in that with many ingenuities: and from them are those who say, that you should place foods of the sick which generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is inflamed, and extended, and impelled the fracture to the outsides.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we indeed abhor, that no cause quickly be made to do pus hot, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then you add in it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: it should be placed on the place ventosa, then it is sucked with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the roughness may draw excessive fluids to the site, due to its weak positioning.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the site be covered with wool that has already been immersed in warm oil; and they place cotton between the ribs, until it is filled: so that it may be a ligature equal when rolled according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the weak one is treated with the cure of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the resistant thing hurts the weak one, whom he cannot bear, and the mouth presses the bandage with a puncture wounding, and we fear for the weak one: then it is necessary that we tear over the site, and remove from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place an instrument on it that preserves the siphon, of which the memory preceded: and we cut the bone with ease, and we cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we gather two wound lips, if it is large with a stitch: and we treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If an abscess occurs in the meantime, then hurry, and pour cotton in rose oil, and place it on the site: and the weak one is treated with what is appropriate for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also it should be bandaged on the side over which he sleeps, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, the bones of the neck sometimes suffer a fracture, and rarely they are worn out: and likewise the spines of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not healed: then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see that his hands are already softened, stunned, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then you know that he is not cured, and is in many cases mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them, and feels contraction in his fingers and the prick: then you know that the neck of the bone is saved, and that the sick person will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If he has a similar softening of the spine like that, and you want to know if he will also be cured or not: then look at his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and that what happens in his hands also happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion without volition come out: and when he lies on his stomach, excretion without volition comes out: and when he lies on his back and wants to defecate, but cannot: then you know that he is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to him from that, the condition is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure for what happens from that is, to try to reduce the heat of the abscesses: so, to place on the worn spine only rose-colored oil: or with unguent saturated.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on it several times a day, until when the abscess of hot heat is sedated: then place on the one plaster strengthening, drying, and binding over it: and order the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And he should not sleep on the side where he found pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens during the fracture of the scaphoid bone, or anything that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to withdraw from the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some flesh, from the ointment, until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last of the carpal bones is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and equalize the fractured bone with your other hand, as much as possible, and with the second equality.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top of it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the previous cure, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then the fracture of them is not, except for the comminution at their extremities: and they are broken in length, and incline to the insides: and a painful point occurs in that place, and a pricking: and it amazes the leg that breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed, the restoration of it is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand on the fracture as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at their extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the equality, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or it already inclines to the insides: then make the weak one lie on his belly, until preparation for the restoration of that fracture is made for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have set the bone, apply a plaster to it: then place a splint on it, either of wood or of leather, and tie it up securely so that you do not fear the breaking of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And when you have set the hollows of them with what will fill them, until the bandage covers them equally: and then command the sick person to lie on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if an abscess should form on him, hot: then cease from extending it, and his restoration, until the abscess forms hot: and place on him what will sit on him, according to what preceded, then return to his restoration: and tie him as it is fitting.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if indeed a splinter has entered into the bone, or it is broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the humerus.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If indeed it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied on both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick person sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm on the wood, until it reaches the titillum of it, in which is attached the curve of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then something heavy is hung over it, so that the servant extends it towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician equalizes the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns, according to what is fitting.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	Another method is to place the weak person in a supine position over their shoulder: and hang his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants to hold one of them with the part above the fracture in their hands: and for the other to hold below it, and each of them to stretch towards their part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind under the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and each of the two assistants will stretch towards their two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then it is necessary to place one bandage under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to place the bandage on that spot, and on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then level the fracture with ease without labor, until when it is equal to the fracture according to what is necessary, and applies good application: then bind it, if no hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But indeed if a hot abscess occurs, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil, until when the abscess is quiet: then bind it: and the method of binding it is to place a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an involution from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then attach the arm to the assistant himself, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind over the assistant's arm, so that the arm stands in the position of the stars: if nothing prevents you from him anything, nor anything is changed on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something will be broken off from the bone and fall upon you, then use the stars (astrology): and it is that you place the broader and stronger star over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every star's width the width of a finger, and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie over the stars with the binding that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding should be over the place of the fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture extends, the less the binding should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the binding as we said, at the hour when you restore the limb, then do this: and if you fear a boil hot, then release the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage in all three days, so that it does not happen in the place of itching, or inflammation, or prevent the food to reach the limb, because of the excessive positioning of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Correct therefore all that, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are of trust, so that nothing happens from it: then do not release the bandage, except after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the sleep of the sick person be on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and put under his support a cushion full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider in every hour of the night or day, so that the broken limb's figure is not released, or the bandage is softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct therefore all that by your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And put the food of the sick person according to the order that we prescribed, so that the food is subtle in the first place, until he begins to close his mouth: then it is necessary, that you make his food thicker.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	The custom for the knee and leg is to be bound for forty days. Therefore, it should then be dissolved, given a bath, and treated with ointments that heal it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is ugly and worn down, then do not dissolve the bandage and splints for fifty days and two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of the arm fracture:
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13:
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearms.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small and is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large and is that which is placed under the small part from below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps only the larger forearm is broken, or the smaller one: and perhaps they are both broken at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the larger forearm is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse it is, when both bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm above, then it is fitting for the doctor at its restoration, to place a small extension with ease, until it becomes even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the larger forearm is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to place a stronger bandage very much.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand at its restoration, and its extension extended over the sandbag.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers: and the joint below all the fingers, or the rest, and the weak one sitting squarely on itself, and the sandbag in front of it, or directly against it, in height, so that the weak one does not suffer labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend his arm from the lower part, either with his own hand or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend from above in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should equalize the jaw, until he reduces it to its best possible form.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then try to reduce all the fragments to their proper place by your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it appears to be a separate splinter, and pierces the skin, and there is no hope of its restoration, then cover it over and remove it according to the method we mentioned for those things that were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already treated that chapter, therefore take the treatment of that from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then make a linen cloth with a thick and thin layer of rose oil, and white chalk, and it should be medium between thickness and fineness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine binding, until when the abscess is calmed down: then remove the chalk, and place a prepared plaster made from flour millstone with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you should know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements, whether it is a fracture in one fossa, or in two fossae at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your binding over the stronger and more forceful place of the fracture, and a little more with the binding to the upper part of the fracture, or to its lower part: or place a softer binding for a short time, according to the previous mention in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, smooth, moist cloths: and not rough, harsh ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is used to tie it from linen, a medium between thin and thick, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to rub the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and do not constrict the limb until it is calm, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already been made soft and the bone is already removed, and similar things have occurred: then correct that whole with your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess of bandaging, then it is necessary to make it soft for a short time, and leave it for several days until the nourishment reaches it, then bandage it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if something does not happen to the sick person among those things that we have said, then it is not necessary to dissolve it, unless after twenty days, or about these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then hang the hand of the sick person around his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and guard it with its own virtue from being moved.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of that is according to the dispositions of the humors, and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	¶ On the restoration of fractures Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV: On the Treatment of Wounds Caused by Arrows and Spears
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it rarely occurs that the hand's blade and the fingers' knots break.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And this does not happen to him unless by frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when the fracture of the foot or rubbing occurs, it is necessary for the invalid to sit in a chair: and there should be a seat in front of him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant extends the broken bones, and the physician adjusts them until they are united by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage, if there is no hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint above according to the size of the wound, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is towards the lower part of the plantar arch, then make a similar sphere from linen: and order the invalid to cover it with his own foot: then it is bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot: and bind it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	But if the fracture is towards the outside, then it is necessary: to place a splint above, and another from below in the foot: and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a strap, as the hand is turned over: and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	But if the fracture occurs to some of the finger's knots, then if it is the thumb, it will be adjusted according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is bound with the foot: and if you wish, place a straight splint, small: so that the fracture may be raised, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, auricular, or anular, then it should be treated and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all should be bound according to continuity, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or a small splint is placed over it, as we mentioned in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after its arrangement with hot fomentations: and place it with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to how its story repeats.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the Restoration of a Fractured Hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks, and is indicated by sensation: because it turns to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done so that the ligament is bound above the fracture, and another ligament under the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person lies face down.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the assistant stretches all the ligament to its part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be to the part of the comb, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And thus similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament near the knee should be, so that the extension is to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician equates the bone with both of his hands, until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and joins the bone with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then you should place a plaster and bandage, if not an abscess happens to the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an abscess occurs in him: then let him be left for several days until the abscess becomes hot, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its situation should be as follows.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to wrap the broken lower jawbone, that is, the bandage: and double it twice, or three times: and the excess should remain from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the base of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long rope between the hips and leg near the knee to the lower parts, and the ends of the rope come from the upper parts of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the leg and hip that remains excessive from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip in the place of the fracture itself small stars, and place an astella from them on the knee joint.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage is equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle of the place of the fracture with three wraps, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend from the place of the fracture with the rope, your bandage should be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then tie to the two ends of the rope that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind therefore with both three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then walk with the two ends of the rope to the lower parts, until it reaches the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both tie also the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the rope is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let the bandage remain on it while it is there, so that corrosion does not occur to the member, nor abscess, nor inflammation, and similar things to them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, immediately with the solution of it, and correct that which has happened from it all, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if indeed a piece of bone is from a bone that pierces: then it is necessary for you to make it even, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over it, and remove it: and care for with him whose place it preceded, until he is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this hip fracture is bound, besides what is added to it, as we said in the support and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of a fracture thus broken, the lame does not occur.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what is applied to him the other leg, then it is necessary that he who owns it always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is subtracted from it: all of this is according to the diversity of the constitutions, and the other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee joint rarely occurs fracture, but it often occurs to him wear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if indeed it happens to him fracture, then not unless either a crack, or a hole in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with wound, and without wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over all of this with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is so, that it is made even what is broken from his parts with fingers, until it is gathered, and joined according to what is possible from the equality and facility, and the making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster made from sisami flour or milled grain with white egg on it, and place a round star-shaped piece of cloth on top if you have it: and tie it above with a suitable binding.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in the other fractures: as boils hot, and similar to them: thus, you should place everything that is appropriate for it with each accident until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Chapter on the Restoration of a Broken Leg
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and called the leg bone: and the other is thin and called the tibia.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of these from the species of fractures that happen to two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at once, the leg is turned in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thin bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it below: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equality, and tying of the stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the broken leg is a dirty fracture, having many splinters: that extension be less and gentler relief of yours.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself is something from the operation of the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the stars, and complete all your operation, then you should take two bands made of pine wood, which is used in the making of sunshades that are placed under tables: and they are made from the fingers of the hand: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and are not from small pieces: and its length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee down to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then, fold each piece of cloth twice along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg bandage on one side and the other on the other side: let them extend from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then, tie two strips of cloth in three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when tightening is forbidden, the leg leans to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	Indeed, a support will be provided from the wood according to the length of the leg, and it will be placed in it, so that it will keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	Indeed, it is especially important to do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound along with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then, consider the leg every day, and work hard to prevent it from developing an abscess or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If something happens from those, then apply to it what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture does not occur completely in the heel.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, a fracture does occur in the bones of the foot and fingers, and it does not occur to them unless there is wear in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones rising above each other, then place the weak foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up, and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones: then press it or step on it, and make it even again until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster and a bandage on top: and place a small board under the sole of the foot, which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it with a proper foot binding, after you have washed it with cloths and other necessary items.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	Therefore, when three or four days have passed, then dissolve the ligature.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones evened, whether they are broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even as I have told you in the restoration of fingers by hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a sponge according to the length of the finger, and make it a little wider: then place under the foot this table which I have told you, and tie it with a proper foot binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is of the bone, two or three or more, then place over all the finger a sponge of its quantity, wrapped in linen cloth: and tie the table in the lower foot: and let it stand on one end of the table outside the belly of the foot, to hold it well.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, not to forget, but to consider all that I have told you in the other breaks from accidents which we have said: and apply each accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ On the break of the vulva of a woman, and the bone of the beak, and the virgin of the man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back of her own body, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife will fill her vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it be made into a sphere from that in the vulva.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be gently shaken, and her back slowly elevated.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that is how the child comes out, until it is born before the gate of the womb as a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wants to urinate, she should gently remove the child with ease, then urinate: and reduce it back to its original position, as you inserted it first: then return to her pillow first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	She should do this for seven days, or about, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a catheter, and tie it over the opening of the bone, and insert the entire catheter into her womb.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the womb, for the broken bone returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with the child, and she should stand for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the penis, or woman, is broken, then administer in its restoration, and its equilibrium that we have said in the bone of the anchor.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And it should not be hidden in these fractures that are nearby, which barely touch, especially to him who has some study, or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book, for the fracture itself means to you in many arrangements the straight way in its restoration, and its tightness: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the penis of a man when it is broken, take the neck of a goose: and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrapping of cloth on it, and wrap it, and let it be released for three days, or about those, and it will heal, if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a fractured bone when it is accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate for the one who has suffered a fracture along with a wound, especially if it is a large one, such as the thigh bone, or a similar bone, to have the limb set and to undergo a bloodletting immediately: if the conditions for bloodletting are attested to you, as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	However, if the wound is bleeding, then you must hasten to remove it, so that you can sprinkle powdered zegium on it: if there is no other available powder.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, unless an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	However, if indeed an abscess occurs, then postpone the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess has settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would be causing it to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	However, if the fractured bone is prominent above the skin and exposed: then you must attempt to reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with gentle extension and slight force.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	However, if the extension of it is not prepared, and its equalization with your hands is not possible: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take from them three, or four according to the quantity that he needs for that from the treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have a small bulge, so that it is not doubled upon itself in compression above it in the hour of the operation: and it should be sharp at its ends, with a margin on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above it in thickness from its middle to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it should be placed with its sharp end curved over the projecting end of the bone: and it should be pushed with it with equal force until when the bone returns and is made even by some equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the ends of the fracture equal again.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of it are thin and do not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary, that I cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them with what we have said, then cut it with the instrument that suits it from the ones we mentioned: or with a saw in any possible way that is best for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth that which remains in the bone from roughness and small bone fragments.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and finds a weak person after its reduction suffering severe pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you give a great support to the weak person, when your restoration is completed which you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in cold, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is in summer, use warm wine.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place on the wound a poultice, nor anything in which there is oil: so that it does not cause rotting and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer asthma remedies at the time of your completion of the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound be healed: so that I cut with forceps a hole in the folds according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with great caution, lest you tie a wound over a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many a time have these foolish physicians done this: and they caused harm to their sick patients, either death, or corrosion, or zuchum, that is, gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your dressing be soft, gentle, different from the dressings of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is an evil, or a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have mentioned, and find pain in the hanging part: then it is not necessary to put stitches on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them wrap-ups from hard cloth in the place of the stitches, and tie it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove the cloth which you placed on it with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply lint, and ointments with which it is customary to heal wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it comes to you, that you loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it becomes solid and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way, that the pus flows down from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass by, and it does not solidify, nor the pus is not separated from it: then you know that there are small pieces of bone in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those small pieces of bone are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And of those that are not separated, and which puncture the member, and cause pain, attempt to cut them off and remove them in any way possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that a wound becomes infected, such as a fistula, or some other form of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each of these, with what is appropriate for its cure, which was mentioned in its previous chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary for me to stand and which you should direct your present mind towards when a bone is broken and protrudes above the member, such as the thigh bone, and the hip, and similar bones from large members, it is, so that you do not presume to pull it out, for often death results from this, indeed let it alone until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore cure the wound, if it seems to you: and otherwise, let it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ On the Cure of Notching at the Stump of a Broken Bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This notching often occurs at the stump of a broken bone during healing.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints: and it defiles the form of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider then, if the notching is recent: administer in it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarsaparilla, and acacia, and similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, you will take some or all of these: and mix them with astringent wine, or with albumen, or with vinegar: and place them on the notching in cotton, and bind them over it with a good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the constriction, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie a lead strip properly over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is the property of removing everything that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the constriction has already turned into stone and is tight, and urgently calls for removal: then cut off the excess part from the top of it, and shave it with some razors until it is removed, and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ On the treatment when restored, and the member remains after that delicate, not according to its natural form.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the bone fracture is restored, and the member remains after that delicate, weak: then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the excessive loosening and tightening of the ligaments and their binding, not according to what it should be: or because of the excess of the constriction of the ligaments, until the nutrition is prevented from flowing to the member: or because of the excess of unnecessary embrocation at an inappropriate time: or because of the lack of blood in the weak body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is to feed the weak person, and make their body tender, until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And give a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And let joy and gladness be introduced to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch on the member: so that the pitch attracts much nutrition to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And it should frequently be embrocated with warm water, until the nutrition flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are being realigned crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member which has already been restored after its healing becomes crooked, and the bone is prominent where it was broken, or twisted: and it is disfigured by this, yet the member is not prevented from performing its natural function: then you should not listen to the opinion of someone who says that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed, this operation is very shameful, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and twisting are recent: then it is necessary to apply a warm water embrocation in which the soothing herbs have been decocted, such as high elder, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let an ointment be made for it with a soothing plaster, such as dyachilon made properly.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or the mucilage of the root of high elder is taken, and it is beaten with chicken fat, or with sesame oil: and it is made into an ointment with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or ripe figs are taken, and they are pounded with the dust of dove's dung, and similar ones which are called from medicines decreasing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the twisting is solved with frequent and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And motion of the member is given to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the crookedness has already preceded, and it has become strong, and it has turned into a stone, and necessity has been provoked for its cure with iron: then it is necessary to follow above it, and to solve the continuity of the bone, and to cut off what superfluous is from the twisting or the bone with delicate knives: and ease is given in that with effort and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	In the case of dislocation, the patient should be placed in a comfortable position and given some food and drink. After a short time, the surgeon should apply a bandage around the affected joint to provide support and prevent further movement. The patient should then be taken to the operating room for surgery.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24:
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the separation of a joint from its normal position.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is forbidden to move the affected joint and the appearance of the limb may be deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pain and injuries to the weak.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when dislocation occurs, one should act quickly to restore it: do not delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if delayed, the affected area may become infected and possibly even the reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to move or extend the affected joint during the hour of its infection.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	However, when this happens, one should act quickly to perform bloodletting for the weak patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he should be dismissed until the abscess has healed.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the entire limb should be cured when it returns to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	Indeed, I have already arranged the chapters of dislocation according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapter on the Care of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw:
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25:
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The lower jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either they are moved slightly from their positions and become somewhat softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	If the dislocation is complete and whole, until it softens to the chest part, until the salt of the sick one passes, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is covered with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when his dislocation is small, then it returns to many positions by itself with a little bit.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed the dislocation is complete and whole: then it must be administered reduction of it quickly, and not to wait entirely: and it is, that the servant holds the head of the sick one: and the physician inserts his finger of his one hand in the root of the jaw dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts two fingers of his at once, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick one, that he clean his jaws, and make them ready for eating at every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician balances the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are at once: then administer steam with hot water and oil, until it becomes easy reduction of both: nor delay entirely the reduction of both, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and balance, and the mouth of the sick one is closed, and they are not softened: then put on them bandages of cloth, with wax which is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then he will be bound with ease with soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the sleep of the sick one is on his back: and his head is standing between two bandages, so that he does not move him to his right and left: nor will he attempt or be forced to chew anything: rather let his food be soft soup, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then he eats what he wants, and it is administered to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	The patient should not exert himself over the operation of his own mouth during eating and drinking, and during yawning, until the jawbone is healed, and he is cured.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jawbones is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their original positions, then fevers and constant sweating often occur from this. And perhaps the belly of the sick person is solved, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, then you will know that it is a loss, and often that person dies who experiences this within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of dislocation of the sternum, and the extremity of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The sternum is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outer side: and this is shown by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, that the sick person should lie on his back, and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your strong ligature, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place on it a plaster, and poultices, and bandage it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	In fact, the extremities that follow the elbow, and are connected with it, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If however it is dislocated on any day, then it must be reduced and adjusted according to what we said, and that which is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place on it a plaster, and poultices, and bandage it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to stick to calmness and quiet, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when this same cure reduces the extremity of the arm, even when it is separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the Reduction of Dislocations of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of these is that it dislocates towards the titillus, or lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, but this is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	It does not dislocate towards the back, because of the spatula (scapula).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate towards the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most commonly dislocated and displaced downwards towards the titillus: especially in those whose flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it exits them quickly, and enters them quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is much, it is the opposite of that, namely that it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that the humerus becomes an abscess due to a blow or accident, and is filled with hot pus, and is thought to be because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you must first try this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part of the titillus: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a manifest difference, and you will find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the titillus, at the touch of the head of the humerus, as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	If it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then a clear touch is found, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that he should raise his hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the handle of it, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the helper should raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it below, for it quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by what we have said, and the days are many since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the weak person be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation is given which softens and soothes, as if the roots of a tall fern, and foenugraecum, and melilot are boiled in water, and is given.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak person should lie on his back: and a sphere and wool are placed under the handle of it, which is equal between softness and constriction.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere, and raises the head of the arm with strength, and pulls the hand of the weak person to the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another helper holds the head of the weak person, so that it does not move to the lower parts: for it quickly returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is, that you make there be a present man who is longer than the weak person, and stands on the side, and inserts his arm under the handle of the weak person: and raises the handle of it upwards, until the weak person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another helper pulls the hand of the weak person to the lower parts of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light: then it is necessary to hang something else with him, which weighs, because the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is, that a long piece of wood be shaped on the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the arm of a mortar: which is not thick, nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it is placed under the patient after they have been laid on top of the head of the wood: and the patient stands according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is stretched out towards the lower parts on the other side, and his body is stretched out from the other part with strength: for the joint returns to its place with swiftness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If however his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two biceps, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance may be eased into the depth of the mortar, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then smooth cloths are laid on top of the round head, so that it may not harm the wood of the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it is placed under the mortar of the patient, so that his hand, or arm may be stretched out over the wood up to the lower parts: and the wood is tied on top of the support and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed on the step of the ladder across its width, and the hand is stretched out towards the lower parts, and the rest of the body is hung from the other part.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entrance is completed as much as possible in any way: then it is necessary to place under the mortar a ball of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from mill flour with benzoin, and egg white on the shoulder entirely, as it wraps around above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie under the tunic with a decent bandage: and wrap the tendon above the plaster: and attach his hand to the neck of himself, and let it be dismissed, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place food for the weak person, until the member is strengthened: because it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then it is placed larger after seven days or five, and exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to him, or for another cause: then it is necessary to administer a cauterizer with three holes in it, according to what was prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if this is all done, and the tendon is dissolved after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are placed on him again several times, and it is not strengthened, and he falls, and cannot raise himself to the superior: then know that his nerves which are to the head of the arm, are already cut, or extended, or softened: and know that the joint will never be in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But of the dislocations which are made towards the chest and the mammillary glands, or to the backs, is made with impulse and extension with hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care are administered to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if it happens after healing that there is severity in the member, and slowness in its movement, then the weak person should use the bath many times, until that severity is alleviated, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Translation: On the Treatment of Dislocations of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty and also returns to its place with difficulty. It can be dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it falls under the sight and touch, according to whatever shape it is dislocated in.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint becomes concave and cannot double the arm, nor can he touch his own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must act quickly to reduce the dislocation before heat abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it does occur, the reduction of the abscess becomes difficult and perhaps he will not be cured at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all kinds of dislocations and more painful to them; and often death accompanies it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is from those that can be reduced, is to extend his hand with two hands; and the arm is stretched, and the hand of the doctor is above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with his fingers or the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand until he strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply strong and very powerful extension; and it is to have two assistants stretch the arm, and they also hold him so that he is not moved during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then, the arm is rolled over to every part after it has been covered by a long doubled cloth or broad bandage on his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it may be one of those things that help in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should strike the joint with a strong blow, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it should be placed on it a plaster, in which there is astringency, and drying with albumen: and it should be bound with a proper bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the weak one: and let it be released for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint is strengthened in its place, then loose the bandage from it, and let it be released.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster, and the bandage, and let it be released for several days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loose it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if it happens to him gravity after the reduction of the joint, and its position is in motion: then administer humidification in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is bound, or put on the joint, that is, a fat tail of a lamb.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bound, and let it be released on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it away, and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then friction the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on it the fat of a lamb once, and twice, and thrice with entering the bath, until it is made soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place wool soaked in warm, buttered vaccination on it, and bind it over the top.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	Indeed, it is soothed, and returns to its original condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of Almahassem's dislocation.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the reduction of its dislocation be quick in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the wound closes: or an abscess hot may occur in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place Almahassem's weak hand on a table, and extend his minister's hand: and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already retreated to the wrist: then place the weak back of his hand on the table at extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be intrinsically on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand on the table should be placed, so that the doctor's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, good: and if not, then bind it with plaster to suppress the abscess: and let him go, and do not repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot exceed the reduction of it, after the days have passed, indeed the joint remains according to its crookedness: and nothing harms the weak one, except that his hand is softened, and he cannot bind anything: then know that the nerves are cut, or worn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no skill in that, unless it is tied with a cauterizer near the wound.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not bring anything together.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Since then Albucasis does not return, then place a plaster on him that we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is tied up and let go for five days: afterwards it is dissolved and let go, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if the movement of it is lost, and something heavy happens to it: then soothe it with hot water and frequent friction, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from all of them, or a finger from the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your fingers, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it against the part to which it is dislocated, and let it go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight on its day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Since then it is night, tie it according to the same story: and do not cease to dissolve it in the day: and exercise it with movement: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days, until it is tied.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it, if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand: and tie it to the same part, and do your operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ On the treatment of dislocations of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spine of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or when many spines are displaced from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the weak one.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of that is, that the discharge of the sick goes out without will, and he cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs are made soft from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them: or one spine is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, which often happens to be removal of them in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore that which is removed to the back, is called Humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure for it is, that you consider then, if Humpback happens from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens by chance, or by blow, or by similar things, the ancients have already spoken of methods of cure in long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have already abbreviated from that, of which little excuses it from much of its cause by my proximity: and from my explanation which I exposed it, and formed an instrument of it in a different way than they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in Humpback which happens from the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is made to both sides even.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, except that which happens in the back properly, with that which I tell: and it is, that the sick be stretched out on his face over an equal podium near the wall: and a wet cloth is spread under him, so that it does not hurt his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then place a straight, fixed wooden pole in the fork of a tree on the ground, near the top of the leg, around the head: and another piece of wood near the feet, at the other end of the leg: and the assistant should hold the wood, and it should not be firmly set in the fork.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other assistant should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then roll over the head of the sick person, and under his tongue, a loose but strong ligament, and extend its end to the wood that is near his head: and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another ligament above his ankles, and above his knees, and at his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments together, and tie them to the other wood that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the assistants should extend to the part of the wood where the ligament is tied, and the two woods should not be moved from their places where they are fixed: but they should not be firmly set, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his hands on the sacrum with force, until he returns: or place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should connect his feet to the board, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And place it on the wall from which we said that it is near the sick person, the place where the end of the board should enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the sacrum.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tie it well, until the sacrum is compressed, and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the chisel that is rolled up with your hand: and it is, so that you shape two pieces of wood near the head of the sick person at the end of his leg, whose length is the arm of one person: and near the head of the sick person at the end of his leg.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be such that it is between every wooden palm one: and already made is in every place a hole, through which runs the tongue: and all the wood is secured firmly on the ground much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let the round wood be inserted: and it is the tongue in which the ligament is rolled up in two holes of two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is secured, whose length is a palm with that which is rolled up: and in two other woods there is similarly of it.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you tied in the chest of the weak one, which is at his head: and the ligaments that you tied in his legs in the tongue which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand at every tongue, the one who turns his hand with the ligament, with which the tongue is rolled up: and the doctor adjusts the Spondyle, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tongue that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the Spondyle returns, and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary to put on a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then bandage.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then put above the plaster a star from the board, whose width is three fingers, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that will take the place of the Gibbus, and on the side of the healthy Spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And he should use the weak nourishing food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains of the prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to give medicines that soften and ease, with the administration of the board that we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a piece of lead is administered on that plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	Sometimes there is a prominence in the last spine of the back: and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not appropriate to make an assumption with this remedy: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the joints of the ankle and the elbow do not occur except for dislocation alone: nor does it happen to them that what happens to the other joints from a slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is most dislocated towards the inside: and a little dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of dislocation towards the inside is because when you join the injured leg with the injured one, it is longer: and its knee is higher than that of the healthy person, and the injured person cannot double their foot near the groin: and there is a location following the groin which is suppurating with heat, therefore, because the hip joint has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign that it happens to the outside is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign that it happens towards the front is because it stretches the healthy leg according to its complement: however, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step on that towards the front: and it retains its urine, and the groin of it suppurates, and at walking it is calloused on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of this dislocation is that it does not extend the knee, and cannot double before doubling the inguinal region: and its thigh is also shorter on the other side: and the inguinal region is softened, and there is a hip joint at the place of that.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	However, the reduction of this dislocation is a matter of considering whether the dislocation is old and has already existed for a long time in the person having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer reduction to it, and it remains in its original position, then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, one should not make a complete assumption about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case of a recent dislocation that is one of the four types of dislocations, then act quickly to roll it back into place, extend it both internally and externally, and move it with your right and left hand: perhaps it will return to its original position, and will not require any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return to its original position in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the thigh from the lower part: either with his hands or with a bandage that is tied above the thigh over the knee: and another assistant extends his hand above, so that his hands can be inserted under the tissues.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie a loose bandage over the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And there should be extension from either the front part of the inguinal region to the back of the ribs, or from the back to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And there should be extension of all of them at the same time, until the weak one is raised up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this is the common type of extension among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, however, the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to use any kind of the treatment that I will mention for proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, in its own reduction when the dislocation is to the insides, it is necessary for the sick person to lean over their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the ligament on the root of the thigh, in that which is between the hip joint and the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the ribs.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong-armed assistant should take his arms, and reduce the large space of the sick thigh, and extend it to the outside with forceful extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it is returning to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind of treatment is easier than other kinds of cure for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, it excuses you and does not obey you at all with this kind of treatment for cure: then it is necessary to bind two sick feet together with a strong ligament, gently, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each be equal to four fingers from its companion in quantity: and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then hang the sick person over the top of the beam, which is in the house: and let its length be from the ground equal to the quantity of two biceps.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order the young and strong one to protect the hip joint: and hang the sick person with another young one: and push the other young one, protecting the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in its own reduction when the dislocation is to the outsides, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on a footstool, as we have mentioned for one having stiffness.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a ligament is tied across his leg, properly weak, and across his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden splints will be placed, one by his feet, and the other by his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a wooden splint will be placed in the middle of his foot, firmly fixed: above which they will be wrapped in moist cloths, so as not to hurt the weak one: and it should be a splint between his thighs, so that it does not pull towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant will extend to his own part, and the doctor will equal the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place on top of him the board, and press him as we said in stiffness, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick one lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the sick leg be extended quickly: and it is according to this same narrative on the foot: and the doctor places his right hand palm down on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he encloses him with the other hand, and with this enclosure places him extended towards the lower parts to the knee part.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the sick one be extended towards the lower parts, and be raised on the ground: but it is necessary that he be placed on something hard, as it should also be if his ankle is dislocated to the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two ankles: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are stretched: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be given with the board also on the place from which he exited the joint, when the reduction is completed according to what should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the infirm one: and when you see them equal, and the infirm one stretches his leg, and expands it without excuse: then you know that the member has returned, according to what is necessary: then join two coxas, and put on a plaster, and bind with an imemati, that is, wheel: thus, so that it does not move towards any part of the wound: and let the infirm one stick to it for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then dissolve the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other one: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore complete the infirm one for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and let it go for three days also.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then dissolve it and make it slow in walking on both sides for several days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated to the outsides, to the insides, and to the lower parts, that is, to the posteriors.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate to the fronts.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is, that you order the infirm one, that he apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not stick to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all its dislocations is, that you make the infirm one sit straight, so that he can extend his leg on it if he can, and stick his back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then press your knees together with your hands, and place them straight between your fingers on the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your palm to both sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant will extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of return is when the leg sticks to the hip in comfort, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply the plaster to him, and press the leg against the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then tie it together with a bandage for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should not use walking for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses to return it to you, then apply strong extension with the ligatures, of which the previous description was given in the cure of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ On the cure of the dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone sometimes moves slightly away, and sometimes dislocates completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either to the inside or to the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone inflated, protruding to the part to which it dislocates.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But its cure of removal is easy return: and it is that it is extended with ease with the hands, and adjusted, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its cure however when it dislocates completely, it is necessary to do that the sick person sits upright: and the strong assistant holds him from the back part of his back, in the middle of himself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold you with your right hand the foot of him from the upper part of his leg, and with your left hand the place of the ankle from the lower part of the foot.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the patient's foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, using two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and push the sole of the foot towards the leg with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg in the third finger, and you pull the tendon.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to the first or second finger in this manner, and you see the foot even, it is good; but if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it does return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is prohibited to you to reduce it with what we have described, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a firm staff on the ground so that he falls between his buttocks; and you have already uncovered him above it, so that he does not hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take his thigh: afterwards he extends the assistant's foot, or with his hands, or with a bandage that ties around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant extend against the extension of his companion: and the staff should be standing between the two thighs of the patient, holding him, so that his body is not drawn to the lower parts during extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and the assistant holds the healthy leg to the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore when the dislocation returns, and its health of the return is declared to you: then place a plaster and bandage, and bind it firmly with bands, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you guard or fear the hollows, which are above the heel posterior, so that there is not a strong bandage over them, and they do not hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him rest for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the tendon becomes softened, bind it up; then dissolve it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the weak person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he tries to walk before that time, there is no safety that the joint will not be dislocated on him, and corrupted, and not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if he gets a hot abscess: then it is necessary that the caregiver in the sedation of which our previous narrative was in another place from the cure and ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and the cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that the dislocated one be put back in place with extension a few without labor: and this indeed is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in certain bends of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that he make the weak person sit with his foot on an equal level with the earth, or on a board: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then you tread on it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see that it is now equal, and does not appear in the elevated place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under his foot a board which catches the whole of his foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then dissolve it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound up and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the kinds of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to someone and you try to cure it and restore them, death often follows: and because of this, one should not presume over their cure, which is such as this, unless they are wise in the art with long experience, merciful, pious, slow, not rash, nor presumptuous: and that they use hot medicines which settle ulcers in the beginning of treatment, and let the sick person go by divine judgment for a long time.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for health from deliverance with the mitigation of pain, and in which something appears to be a sign of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before an ulcer hot occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns as we wish, then administer the regimen which settles the ulcer: and care for the wound with it which suits him from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If however the dislocation is with fracture, and they occur in the separated bones of the shoulder, then try to remove them, and do in it what we said in simple pains from that which preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your skill, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: as it preceded my preaching to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more saving to your body among them in your time.
