of the abscess in the throat
When an abscess forms at the root of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, it becomes putrid, round, old, and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; afterward, place it on the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the back of the place; do this once or twice, afterward treat it with what we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed; and if it is healed this way, it is good; if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
