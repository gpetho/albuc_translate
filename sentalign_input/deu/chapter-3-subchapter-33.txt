Chapter 33.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated, either inward or outward.
The sign of dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen towards the direction it is dislocated.
The treatment for a slight displacement is a gentle reduction, extending it easily with the hands until it returns.
For a complete dislocation, have the patient sit straight, with a strong assistant supporting their back from the middle.
Hold the upper part of the foot with your right hand and the lower part near the ankle with your left hand.
Pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and then extend it with the left; push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.
Do this twice as we have described.
Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg a third time, focusing on the ankle.
If the foot returns to its place once or twice in this manner and appears aligned, it is good; if not, repeat the procedure until it does.
But if you are unable to reduce the dislocation as described, lay the patient on their back on the ground, secure a block firmly to the ground, and place it between their thighs, wrapped with cloth to avoid injury.
Then one assistant holds the thighs, and another extends the foot with their hands or with a band tied around the ankle; each assistant pulls in opposite directions, while the block between the thighs holds the body steady to prevent it from being pulled down during the extension.
The physician aligns the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the healthy thigh downward, allowing the dislocation to return easily.
Once the dislocation is reduced and confirmed, apply a poultice and bandage it tightly, binding the foot to the leg.
Take care to avoid compressing the nerves behind the heel too forcefully to prevent damage.
Leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it.
Remove the bandage on the third or fourth day, and prohibit walking for 40 days.
But if walking is necessary before this time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, preventing proper healing.
If an abscess occurs, treat it as previously described in another place with appropriate care and embrocation until it subsides.
