On the treatment of broken bones when they heal crookedly.
Chapter 23.
When, after healing, a crookedness, protrusion of the broken bone, or a knotting occurs in the limb and this distorts the shape of the limb, but does not prevent it from its natural function, then do not follow the advice of anyone who suggests breaking the limb again.
Many foolish doctors and restorers in our land have done this.
This procedure is indeed highly blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as it is potentially fatal.
But if the limp and knotting are recent, then they should be massaged with warm water in which softening herbs, like marshmallow leaves and root, and sweet clover, and similar herbs, have been boiled.
Apply a plaster made with a softening plaster, such as properly prepared dyachilon.
Or take marshmallow root mucilage, mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply it as a plaster.
Or take fat figs, grind them with pigeon dung, and similar ingredients known among medicines that reduce hardening.
Sometimes, the knotting loosens with gentle, prolonged, and careful rubbing done with wet hands.
Move the limb in every direction at all times.
If the crookedness is longstanding, has become strong, and has turned to stone, and there is a need to treat it with metal tools, then it is necessary to cut above it, to separate the bone union, and to remove the excess from the knot or bone with fine cutting tools, applying ease and care.
