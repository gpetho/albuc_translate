Chapter 11:
Restoration of fractures of the elbow.
The elbow is what is between the elbow joint and the shoulder.
If it is broken, the restoration is done in one of two ways, the first being to take a flat piece of wood of moderate thickness shaped like this:
Tie two bandages at both ends and suspend it from a high place.
Have the patient sit on a chair and extend the broken arm over the wood until it reaches the middle, where the curvature of the wood attaches.
Then suspend a heavy object from it, or have an assistant extend it downward; the doctor aligns the fracture with their hands until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method involves the patient lying on their back, with the hand suspended by a bandage from the neck; instruct two assistants to hold above and below the fracture, each extending in their direction.
If you want stronger extension, tighten the bandage over the fracture with another bandage, and have each assistant extend in their direction.
If the fracture is near the end of the muscle, place half the bandage over the shoulder and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, place the bandage over that area and the elbow.
Align it easily without effort, and once properly aligned and applied, tighten unless an abscess occurs.
If an abscess occurs, leave the tightness until the seventh day, then apply dirty wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, then tighten again.
To tighten, apply plaster over the fracture, wrap it with a clean cloth, adjust the arm over the elbow, and place the hand open on the muscle.
Wrap and tighten the cloth around the elbow so that the arm acts as a splint, unless prevented by a broken bone.
Then use splints.
Place the widest and strongest splint over the fracture, with the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints extending three fingers beyond the fracture.
Tighten the splints with the bandage as described at the beginning of the chapter.
Ensure the bandage over the fracture is the tightest.
The longer the fracture, the looser the bandage should be.
When positioning the splints and bandages as described, restore the limb to its proper alignment.
If you fear an abscess, leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day as described.
Check the bandage in all areas for three days to prevent itching or swelling, or the restriction of food to the limb due to excessive tightness; then adjust as needed.
If confident that none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about three days or more.
Have the patient sleep on their back with their hands on their stomach.
Place a wool-filled cushion evenly on the elbow, and regularly check that the limb's alignment and bandage are intact; adjust if necessary.
Feed the patient according to the prescribed order, starting with light food until tightening begins; then increase the food's substance.
The usual treatment for the elbow and leg takes forty days; then loosen, bathe, and apply ointments to heal.
If the fracture is severe, do not loosen the bandage and splints for thirty to sixty days.
