of abscesses of the marrow
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the marrow, such as canker and stony abscess and herpes and estiomene and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and several other diseases that I mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the marrow, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you want to know the work of iron (cautery), see if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.
Then do not rush to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain subsides;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where they lean, and support their back and bring their feet together towards the lower part of the leg; 
and let their thighs be spread, and place their arms under their knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck from him towards the right side, and use the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the bladder (urethra), the form of which comes later;
and it is necessary that when you use this instrument, you first insert the probe to know the depth of the bladder, so that what enters with the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and does not injure the patient;
and if the instrument is too large, you must cover the depth of the bladder with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt them;
and he must put the funnel of the instrument on top, and hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and it is made soft by hand, it should be cut at the top, with a milk spatula; 
and when the boil is emptied, you must put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and put the tent away from the wound in the depth of the bladder, and put outside, on the bladder and on the scalpel, clean wool soaked in water where mallows have been boiled;
then treat it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes the bladder and the wound are cleaned with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which roots of lily and long birthwort have been boiled;
then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is returned to the bladder, you must avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have described in the section.
