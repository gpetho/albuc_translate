"O children, since I have completed this book, which is the final one on the science of medicine, and its completion has been achieved, through its explanations and clarifications, it seems to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which deals with the action of the hand, namely surgery.
"Because the practice of surgery has been abandoned in our region and in our time, to the point that its knowledge has almost disappeared, and its traces have vanished; nothing remains of it except a few brief descriptions in the books of the ancients, which changed most things and led to errors and confusion until their intentions were obscured and their power and art weakened.
"And it seems to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise according to the method of explanation, clarification, and abbreviation; and because it comes with descriptions of the cautery tools and other instruments for the work as needed for the explanation, and in preparation for it, which is necessary.
"However, the reason why a skilled craftsman with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must be well-versed in anatomy, which includes knowing the joints of the limbs and their shapes, their connection and separation; having knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, as well as their number and arrangement; and understanding the pulsating and quiet veins, and their places of origin.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that it is not in the name but in the action that matters, and mostly in the skill of the hand.
But we have already said about this in the beginning of this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy will fall into error by which many men will die, as I have seen happen too often because some are trained in this science and then abandon it without knowledge or experience.
Because I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor cut into a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he also cut some arteries in the neck so that a large amount of blood flowed out until the woman died in his hands.
I also saw another doctor who tried to remove a stone from a man who had a bladder problem. The stone was large and he attempted to pull it out, but in doing so, he removed part of the bladder along with it, which caused the man to die on the third day.
And I already knew at that moment to attempt to remove it, and I saw that due to the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I recognized that he would die from it.
And there was another doctor who received payment from a duke of our land for his surgical work, and he happened upon a black man who had a fracture in his thigh; with his ignorance, the doctor prepared bandages and astels with strong bindings on top of the wound, without allowing any ventilation to the wound.
And then he removed the bindings according to his desires, and then rebound them, and then left him bandaged for several days and commanded us to remove the bindings; and thus it happened that the thigh and foot were covered in pus, leading to their loss.
And I was called to him, and prepared to remove the bindings; upon doing so, he found relief and his pains ceased.
However, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and thus he could not stop it; the corruption continued to spread in the limb until the patient died.
And I saw another doctor who lanced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after some days, until the evil of it was magnified by its lord.
This is because the black bile of a cancerous abscess is pure humoral, and thus it should not be penetrated with iron from all directions, but rather should be cauterized in one part of the body so that the evil is expelled from the entirety.
And for that, my children, it is necessary for you to understand that the operation with the hand must be divided into two directions: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is a work with which there is danger in the greatest dispositions.
And I have already explained this throughout this book in places where there is operation accompanied by error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard against this and leave that, so that the leaves do not find a path to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your weapons with diligence and under the protection of God, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best way so that by the grace of God they may gain health and praiseworthy success, and leave behind terrible illnesses with difficult healing, and keep your weapons away from what makes you fearful, so that failure in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for it is more lasting to your glory, both now in this world and forever after.
And Gwalia has already discussed some of these issues: "Do not treat evil illnesses, so that you may not be called evil doctors.
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first is the primary section. The first chapter is about the head and feet, including the forms of the instruments and the irons for cautery, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second section. The second chapter is about incision and puncture, and about cupping glasses, and about blisters, and about the extraction of arrows and similar things, all organized and arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, and about the treatment of fractures and similar conditions; it is organized by headings including the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to say what the advantages and disadvantages of that cautery are, and in which conditions it should not be used.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of cautery is a long and extensive discourse, subtle in its knowledge and secretly hidden; many wise men have spoken about it, and they disagreed with each other. As for me, a little of their discourses is sufficient for me, fearing prolixity. ?>
"And therefore I say that you should make a cautery universally on the entire complexion, whether it has matter or not, with the exception of two complexions that are cold complexions without matter.
"In the cold and dry complexion with matter, it will be dried out; because some say that cautery is beneficial for that, while others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by quality and dryness, since the nature of fire is hot and dry, and it is unsuitable to treat a cold and dry illness with hot and dry [cautery], as the illness should be treated with its opposite.
"And I disagree with those who say the opposite, that cautery is beneficial in all cold and dry illnesses found in the bodies of men; for when you compare the body of a man and its humidity to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
"And I say based on this reasoning that experience has shown me many times.
"However, it is not necessary to dwell on this matter, as it has already been proven and practiced in the chapter on cautery through previous exercises. One who is knowledgeable will understand the diversity of human complexions and the dispositions of their illnesses within them, as well as the causes and accidents of these illnesses and the duration of their effects.
In other ailments, do not be afraid, especially in cold and moist diseases, for all doctors agree on these matters and there is no disagreement regarding the use of cautery in treating them.
And know, children, that the secret of healing with fire and the goodness of it is also applied in medicinal burns through cautery, for fire is simple and its effect only reaches the member being cauterized and does not harm other members connected to it except minimally.
However, the effect of a medicinal burn spreads to neighboring members and quickly reaches the diseased member that is difficult to heal and easily cured.
But fire, due to its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except in excess. And it is known to us by experiment and long study in this art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this speech. And if it were not that it is not read in my book, here I would stop and reveal to you a secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in the body and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, demonstrated with philosophical reasoning, which would satisfy your desires.  />
And know, children, that they disagree about the time in which it is appropriate to perform cautery and consider the best time to be spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm caused by incidental factors is mitigated by the benefit of this treatment, and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains or strong fistulas, which cannot tolerate delay due to fear that more serious conditions may develop.
And do not let this weigh on your minds, my children, for only the common people and foolish doctors believe this. Thus, in the illness that is cured by cautery, there will always be a relapse, and they claim that as a consequence.
And the reason is not as they think, for cautery is only used in places where medicine alters the complexion and dries up the humidities that cause the pains.
However, cautery is preferred over medicine due to the intensity of its effectiveness and the power of its operation, as well as the greatness of its practitioner.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time, depending on the constitution of the patient, the location of the illness, and the strength of the practitioner, as well as what has been prepared in the body of the patient from an accumulation of superfluities, and what has been acquired by him through his diet and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery on a tooth for pain and the like. In this case, it is possible that the pain will not return, but rather, it may occur in lesser degrees.
And the common saying is that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and this is a correct statement, because I believe it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or for any other reason except cautery.
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort in medicine applies only when the methods of treatment in certain illnesses fail, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the treatment one administers cautery, and it benefits for that. And therefore it is concluded that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention which I understand from the common people and too many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that to cauterize with gold is better than to cauterize with iron, and they did not say this except for the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauterization does not break out in blisters, although this is not entirely true, for I have already proved and found that it happens only in some bodies but not others, and cauterizing with gold is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you make a cautery with fire on gold, it is not clear to you, because the gold melts according to the amount you want due to the thinness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive blisters. And if you light a fire under it, the gold will melt from the heat, and some sheets may fall into the fire as the artisan can see from that occupation.
And for that, a cautery with an iron should be used as lightly and carefully as possible during the operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on the cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged those from the head down to the feet, in order to make it easier for the inquirer to find what they want.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the moisture and cold that cause the accident of which there are two causes: salt and an abundance of rheumatic flux, known as head cold, which flows from the head to the corners of the eyes and ears, causing much sleepiness, toothache and sore throat, and generally all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, salt and apoplexy, and similar conditions in those illnesses.
The manner of this cauterization is as follows: first, command the patient to be evacuated with a purgative medicine that purifies the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient and their age and habit.
And then order them to shave their head with a razor, and then make that person sit between your hands on a low bench, and have them place their feet on the ground.
"And then place the root of your palm near the bridge of his nose, between his eyebrows. "But when you reach the midpoint of his body, mark that spot with a needle, and then heat up the olive-shaped cautery, whose shape is as follows:
"And then place that (cautery) on the marked spot, in such a way that it descends, while you gently squeeze your hand around it, and rotate it.
"And then lift your hand slightly and look at the spot, and if you see any portion of the bone revealed, even as small as a grain of barley, then lift your hand; but if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another one, if it has cooled down, until you see what I have told you.
"And then take a little salt and dissolve it in some water, then apply it to the spot for three days.
"And then place upon him a linen cloth soaked in vinegar, and leave it on him until the crust of the fire is destroyed. "And then treat the spot with tetrapharmacum ointment until it is healed.
And they say that while the wound remains open, it is better for the arm, because it is more beneficial and healing.
And some say that the tendon should be cauterized within the bone, and the cautery should be held in place until a part of the bone's appearance changes.
Then it should be shaved as close as possible to the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery one should reach the end, pressing hard on the bone until it breaks, and this is the method of small alphabetization. And they believe that from that place the fumes of the head are expelled.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be treated until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two types of cauterization applied to everyone, only to some men due to fear; and if you ask me, it is better for the health when it exists, because the head is freed by a solution of continuity in the same way as we have shown in other members, especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and it is from that one that health comes.
Chapter two.
Of the cautery of the head.
When all the head experiences chronic and prolonged pain in the patient, and he is accustomed to using purgatives, clysters, and capipurges, as well as poultices, hot baths, helmets, and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery that does not benefit him in any of these causes, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and it is not weak, and one finds a great deal of coldness, then he should cauterize with another cautery near that one a little. Then cauterize that area on the crown of his head with a cautery until the scab is removed. After the scab has been cut and removed, revealing an adequate amount of bone, cauterize that area with a cautery in the back part of the head, specifically in the location known as the "vas" — this is the place where a cupping glass is applied. And be careful with this, and do not expose the bone, because the patient may find great pain from this, different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And I say this cautery in its place, because the cautery with which you have cauterized the horns of the head and the occiput should be a finer cautery than that with which the middle part of the head has been cauterized; and this is its form.
And I say this cautery in its place, because the cautery with which you have cauterized the horns of the head and the occiput should be a finer cautery than that with which the middle part of the head has been cauterized; and this is its form.
On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.
When there is a severe pain in the head or when the pain spreads to the eye, evacuate with purgative medicines and administer the other treatment that I have mentioned in the treatment of illnesses; if it does not improve, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either by cauterizing with a sharp burning instrument or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning instrument is done by taking an aloe leaf, cleaning it and tying off both ends of it. And then incise the painful area on the temple with a blunt lance until it is in place and hidden under the hair.
And then press strongly on it with a bandage for constant compression, and leave it there for the space of three hours; and then remove it and take away the aloe, and let the wound be for two or three days, and then place a cotton swab soaked in vinegar on it until the area turns red.
And then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
And if you go, do so with some burning medications that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medications.
But cauterize with iron according to this method: take for cautery that of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail-like claw, because its tip is shaped like a clove of garlic with some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small protuberance.
Then place it on the painful spot, and hold your hand — so that the bow is not burnt away beneath — and turn the iron slowly with speed.
And if the amount that is burnt by the point of the coal is such that it is most of it, lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burnt, lest blood flow come.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days; then place clean cotton with a border, and then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
And if you go, cauterize with the tip of the scalpel according to this method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particularly ancient migraine.
Chapter Four.
On the Cautery of Old Headaches.
When you cure a headache with the water that we have mentioned in the previous treatment, and as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and sometimes because the disease is not helped by what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then it is necessary for you to heat the cautery knife until it is red-hot, because you indicate on the site of the pain with a line of length equal to the majority of the said [finger], either this one or that one; and place your hand for one moment and press it firmly until you reach the vein and enter into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to continue with the jawbone, which is moved by chewing, and that the tendon is not damaged and the nerve that moves it, so that a spasm does not occur.
And if it is on the caution and care of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut, because in its cutting there is fear, and especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not skilled or practiced; leave this operation at first.
And I will come with the memory of the treatment for the flow of blood due to an archery injury according to its manner in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness does not cease with this cautery and the body of the patient is tolerable, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and care for the wound until it is healed.
And if you see, administer the cautery which we said in the chapter on archery wounds with two pointed irons, and this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5
Of the cauterization for earaches
When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is not cured with purgative treatments or other treatments mentioned in the division, then apply the cautery, which is called "point," and this is its shape:
And then apply the point close to the fire, and it should be held around the entire ear like a wheel in rotation, or around each area if the pain is in any one area. Approach with the cautery of the edge of the ear little by little, more than you have the sensation of the place with your finger.
And if you make points with this cautery on the entire ear, then remove it, and afterwards cure the area until it is healed.
Chapter 6
On Cauterization of Warts.
Warts that are cured with cauterization are not due to the humors that come through phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization for the condition caused by dryness or nervous spasm.
When you cure this type of wart with plasters and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not successful, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one should be at the root of the ear, the second a little below its temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Place your cautery in the opposite direction of the affected part, for softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is as follows: you should cauterize with the cautery at the top right of the ear's extremity, slightly above the hairline on the head, and another one in the temple, whose length should be equal to that of the thumb. Hold the cautery until half the thickness of the tip of a reed is burned off.
And this is the shape of the cautery, which is similar to that of the knife, the shape of which is in front of the table. But it is more subtle than that one, a bit like veins; and it is necessary to cut off some of its excessive roughness.
Then care for the area with water that has been processed beforehand until it is healed.
Chapter VII.
On cauterizing ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it with the water we have mentioned and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries: on all four corners of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery in the nape. And the manner of the cautery is made according to what has been said above.
And he has already been cauterized on the opening of the stomach; and it is worse now; and then he should be treated with processed water.
Chapter VIII.
On cauterizing forgetfulness caused by phlegm.
It is necessary that in the beginning, large vessels and pills be given to the patient for purging.
And then shave the patient's head completely and place on their temples the plaster made of wax, as described in the treatise on plasters.
And do this several times, because that is the manner of cauterization. And perform this according to the order of the physician as I have already said.
And so if he is cured well by this; but if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, descending from the highest part of the head to the nape of the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of your finger, and then cure the cautery with water that has been boiled.
But if you see swelling and the patient is tolerating it well, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if the swelling is more severe, then cauterize on both temples.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the form given above.
Chapter IX
On cauterization of the parietal lobe and on softening of the whole body.
Know that you should proceed with cleansing of the head with jars and with the water we have mentioned; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on both temples of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck. ‌
Here's the translation of the given sentence: And then cure that within which is healed, and this should be cauterized with olive oil.
Chapter 10
On the Cauterization of Epilepsy.
Do not cauterize the epileptic unless their epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to clean the brain of the patient at its beginning with years and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and chewable lozenges that cleanse, for many days, with the improvement of food.
Then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and over each corner of the head. And if the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize them with the cauteries mentioned above, after having paralyzed and softened the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And use the cautery as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then use a fine cautery in this manner.
Chapter 11.
On Cauterizing Melancholy
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humidity and thick vapor, then cauterize it with those cauteries which we have said [to use] in cases of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess fluid inclining towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give them water to cleanse their brain as was previously stated in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, and make a decent-looking tonure of it on the crown, and place that in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be seated comfortably, and held securely from all sides.
Then apply an ointment, and it is more fitting to use old sheep fat for this purpose. And warm that on the fire with a moderate heat, which he will endure when it is most in him. Then pour that into the middle of his head on the crown, and let it be absorbed until he is chilled.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with their other prescribed treatments until they are healed; or if you prefer, cauterize that area with small points according to the patient's strength, but you must hold the cautery like this: this type of cautery is one that is dipped in the brain with equal parts.
And then immediately bandage that area with clean linen or gauze.
Chapter XII.
About the cauterization of water descending in the eye.
When you have recognized the beginning of water in the eye by the signs that I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse their head, and protect them from all moisture.
And have the patient bathe in warm water for several days.
And then order the patient to shave their head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize again with two cauteries on both temples if the water begins in both eyes, or with one stroke if it begins in one eye.
Make incisions with the cautery on all the veins and arteries that are below the cervical vertebrae, and let the cuts be in that direction towards the temples.
And beware of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see any bleeding from it, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with wisdom in the extraction of arrows and in the excision of those, and in the prevention of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below two bones with two properly produced cauteries.
Chapter XIII.
On the Cautery of Ancient Tears.
When tears of the eyes are ancient and persistent, and it is verified that this is due to an excess of phlegmatic humors in the veins and arteries manifestly present on the surface of the head, then cauterize with a cautery as described at the beginning of water falling from the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the bones. And if you need to add more, then cauterize that along the entire side of the eye, at the extreme end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV.
"On the cauterization of a smelly nose.
"When you treat someone with the medicine mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work, then prepare and give the patient to drink the herbs for three nights; and then shave their head, and cauterize them with a mild cautery or an olive-oil cautery. "Then cauterize that person with a clove cautery and two cauteries on the eyebrows, just below the hairline.
"And be careful not to burn too deeply with the cautery.
"And this is the method for the clove cautery.
"Chapter XV.
"On the cauterization to soften the eyelids of the eyes.
"When the eyelid of the eye is softened due to illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery made from this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
"And if you wish, cauterize that [the eyelid] on the eyebrows a little with two cauteries in every direction, and let them be long from the temples. "And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is burnt.
Chapter XVI.
When the hairs of the eyelid turn inward and close the eye,
When the hairs of the eye turn inward to the point that they puncture the eye, cauterization is done in two ways: either by burning or with a caustic medicine.
If the cauterization is done with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to pluck their eyelashes like those that are being treated until they grow out and have a proper shape; and if it is necessary for him to close his eyes, then you should strengthen his eyelids with a bandage so that he will not be disturbed until the hairs regrow. 👉 This translation assumes "huels" means "eyelids" (from Latin "palpebrae") and "pels" means "eyelashes" (from Latin "cilia"). The verb "naysement" is understood as coming from Latin "nasci" meaning "to be born" or "regrow".
When they have regrown and been trimmed, then place the patient's head in your lap, and carefully mark on his eyelid with a tent (a small probe or needle) the shape of a leaf of myrtle, beginning the mark near the eyelashes.
And then place a piece of cloth soaked in egg white or flour paste over the wound.
And then heat the cautery which looks like this.
And then cauterize over the figure that you have marked, little by little, in well-defined spots, until the surface of the ulcer, which is like a myrtle leaf, appears clearly.
And the sign of healing of this work is that you see the eyelid of the wound already be contracted and the hairs of it raised towards the puncture of the wound.
And so raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then place over it a cloth with an edge until the crust is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the hairs return for any reason and the eyelid is softened, then do the cautery again over that area as you did initially.
But if the hairs are on the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is smooth, and the hairs do not touch the eye.
Certainly! Let's break down the text and translate it line by line into English:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And place the stone on the medicine and press it gently without removing it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is in them as if by fire.
And when you perceive that he has felt the bite, then remove the medicine and wash it with your stone; when the bite ceases, then replace the medicine and wash the wound with water; and then consider if you see that the eyelid is already raised as if washed by constriction with fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to apply the medicine on the spot where you have not yet applied the medicine and do not remove it until your operation is completed and the wound is closed.
Then place a bandage over the wound until the trace of the inflammation is removed, and then cure it with healing ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to perform your operation with vigilant diligence so that no part of the medicine falls into the wound, and if the eyelid after several days becomes softened and some hairs grow in the wound, then repeat your medicine on that spot where the eyelid has become softened, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then cover it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the soles of men are differentiated according to size and smallness, and therefore your treatment is made accordingly.
And it will not be hidden from one who has studied this art the path of correctness.
Chapter XVII.
About the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you cure a fistula with the water that we have mentioned in the division of diseases and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it in this manner: command the patient to place their head on your knee, and let another servant hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that it will not be moved or shaken with the patient's head.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or chickpea flour on their eye.
And then ignite the cautery, the shape of which is as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or the quill of a vulture, one end of which is used to make the cautery.
And if you wish, it should penetrate into the other end. And if you want it to turn out as intended.
However, that which is concave is better for the intended work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw from it sanity and dryness. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the putrefaction from it.
Then place over it the cautery which is well ignited, and with that same hand a little below the cautery of the nostril towards the nose, so that your hand does not err or the patient becomes restless; then place the cautery on the hairs of the nostril and corrupt it. 😊
Therefore, if at the beginning of your cautery it enters into the bone, good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, as necessary; and leave it thus for three days, and then place over that spot with a bandage and surround it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if twelve days have passed and it is not healed, then place over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scrape it according to what you need in its chapter. 😊
And there is another manner of cauterizing a fistula which others before me have said: apply at the place of the fistula and open it up, then place in that fissure a thin probe of the same shape; and pour into it one ounce of melted lead; and with your hand hold it firmly in place, so that the patient is not disturbed by this, lest the molten lead reach the bottom of the fistula; and it is necessary to apply over the nostril of the patient a patch smeared with egg white or water, because the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it through marvelous healing. 😊
And if the fistula is healed with the water we have mentioned for the cautery and treatment, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a trauc [medicine] through the nose and reduce the fistula back into the nasal cavity, in its proper place.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the Cauterization of the Fissure of the Feet
Often these fissures occur in the lips, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with the water we have mentioned in the previous sections and it does not improve your treatment, then use a small pointed cautery according to this form:
And let its cavity be according to the subtlety of the little knife.
Then gently press that [cautery] into these fissures until it reaches the depth of the fissures.
And then treat it with plasters until it is healed.
Chapter XIX
Of the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Mouth
When an abscess forms at the root of the uvula or on the palate or at the root of the teeth, and it swells, and then bursts, and then becomes chronic, and runs pus and a fistula is formed, and when you treat it and the treatment does not improve, then you must heat a cautery according to the size that is received in the fistula, and put the hot iron into the opening of the fistula, and with your hand guide it until it reaches the bottom of it; and at the end do this once or twice; and then treat it with water as we have said for treatment until it is healed.
And therefore if the wound is cut open and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the rotten bones according to what will be found in its chapter.
Chapter XX.
Of the cautery of teeth and softening of veins.
When the veins are softened by moisture and the teeth are bad, and you treat them with medicines but they do not help, then place the head of the patient in your lap, and quickly heat the cautery in the shape which will be described below, so that you can put the tip on the tooth and insert the heated cautery into it immediately, holding your hand a little over it, so that the patient feels the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth.
And then lift your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
And then the patient should rinse his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the bad tooth is fixed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter XXI
"About cauterization for tooth pain.
"When tooth pain is due to coldness, or if there is a blister or worm in it and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterize the area using two methods: either cauterize with cow hair or cauterize with fire.
"Cauterizing with hair involves taking cow hair and burning it in the hollow of an iron, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the tip of the tooth, next dipping that in burnt hair, and quickly placing it on the painful tooth until it is cauterized.
"And then repeat this process several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
"And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned hair, and place it on the painful tooth. Then place a red-hot iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the cavity of the tooth.
"However, the cauterization with fire is that you pay attention to the tip of the iron or steel, and there should be some thickness in its center so that the heat of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then heat the cautery in the shape that you will use, and place it on the tooth while holding your hand until the cautery is heated; and do this several times because the pain will be lessened either on that day or on the next day.
And it is necessary that the patient, by pressing that cautery, fills his mouth with good water and holds it for an hour, and then spits it out; and this is the shape of the cautery.
And cauterize with whatever instrument you choose according to what is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
On Cauterization for Hernias.
When hernias are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion through medicines and you wish to promote the digestion of these slightly, then heat the cautery in the shape shown below, which has two open ends so that smoke may escape from one end of the cautery. Place the heated cautery on the hernia once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the center of the hernia.
And if the hernia is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the hernia, and leave it for three days, and then place a compress soaked in water on it until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then care for him with ointments, compresses, and cloths until he is healed.
Chapter XXIII.
About cauterizing hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
When humidity comes upon the channel of the lung, and especially when it is accompanied by coldness of the pleura, then one should evacuate the patient at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterwards you must cauterize the reason for this [condition] in the depressed area of the throat.
And be careful not to reach the trachea with the cautery, nor to burn more than a little of it.
And cauterize [him] with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last vertebra of him. The cautery should be similar to what was previously described.
And then care for him with the aforementioned [treatments] until he is healed.
Chapter XXIV.
About cauterizing lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity, and the patient has neither fever nor phlegm, and it is a long-standing illness, then cauterize [him] with two cauteries on the furcula in the depressed, round, and fleshy places; and with another cautery in the middle of the foot between two teats; and let the cauteries be similar to what was previously described.
And if you wish, let your cautery be pointed with the instrument called a "punctum," the form of which is used in the treatment of ear pain.
And place points within those [cautery marks]; then proceed to treat them with the previously mentioned water until they are healed.
And already, the cautery has three rims for cauterization: with one pass you can make three cauteries following this form.
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the tinnitus, which is the head of the ear.
When the head of the ear is dislocated due to humid and slippery causes and does not return to its place in the time of its movement, you should reduce its dislocation until it returns to its customary place. Then, through a slight movement, it may relocate itself as it should, as we have witnessed. Therefore, it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then turn the patient onto their stomach or side; and then raise the handle that is inside the ear canal with your left hand fingers to the upper parts, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then you will ignite the cautery which has two tips; this is what it looks like:
And then you will cauterize the cord until it penetrates into the other side; and thus, the figure of cauterization will have four tips.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and because there are eight cauteries.
Then place powdered salt on the cautery, and then have the patient rest quietly, ensuring that the limb is not moved for some time until it is soothed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then cauterize the muscle with a small pointed cautery or with several pointed cauteries, because the joint will be strengthened and the moisture eliminated, and thus the patient will be cured.
Chapter 26.
On the Cauterization of the Stomach.
When there is cold and excessive moisture in the stomach to the point that it leaves its complexion and multiplies ruptures within it, and if you continue with your treatment methods but they do not work, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, extend their hands and feet, and then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one cautery below the foot with a pointed tip the size of a finger, and two cauteries beside this one on either side, forming a triangular figure; ensure that these are not too closely spaced to avoid blistering.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds the thickness of the leather cord.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. If you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and let this be a cautery according to the shape of a circle as shown in this form:
And let the stomach be punctured at that which is afraid of this cautery: and it is that you know on the stomach how much with tent, and then cauterize that with cautery in the points; and then heal that with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On cauterizing the cold foot.
When pain occurs in the foot due to coldness, humidity or excessive flatulence until its normal composition is disrupted by superfluous discharge, and the patient is cured with the water we have mentioned and not with oil, then it is necessary that the patient be laid back on their shoulders, and examine with a tent three cauteries according to this form and quantity, placed under the foot, below the hypochondria, in the position of a man lying down.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of the said [part], and let the cauteries be according to the length of the body correctly.
And do not press the cauteries too much.
And if the amount of water that is applied to the majority of the body’s surface is not sufficient; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them be sitting, with their legs extended and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a pointed knife when you are skillful and prudent in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much with the cauterization, and let the surface of the entire body be treated so that the whole body is treated and reaches into the intestines, because the intestine is delicate here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
About the perforation of an abscess in the foot with a cautery.
When there is an abscess in the foot and you wish to determine whether that abscess is in the flesh of the foot or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, with great and sometimes painful acuity that often wearies the doctors who tend to it.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back; and then mark the area of the abscess with a sign; and then heat up the cautery which resembles a needle, the shape of which is shown on the other page. And cauterize with that and the cautery until all the pus is burned away, until it reaches the core, until the pus comes out.
Then treat the area with other treatments for healing until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this form of cautery except that which has been studied in the art of medicine and with which many sick people have been cured; however, some people may try this operation occasionally, but nevertheless, you should leave it to us, and it is better.
Chapter XXIX.
On Cauterizing Pleurisy.
The ancients said to cauterize pleurisy with the purgative herb called aristolochia in this manner: take a long, dry, slender sprig of aristolochia, and let it be as thick as your finger.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And it is not necessary that you grasp the cautery with your hand, but rather let it be held in the handle of the instrument.
And some ancient writers said that there are certain men who use an iron cautery similar to a ray and fiery in nature, and they place it in the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess and drains pus, as we have discussed in the case of a foot abscess.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without risk, because if it is done in the wrong place, such as a fistula that has not healed, death can occur immediately.
Chapter 30.
On the Cauterization of the Spleen.
When treating the ailment of the spleen with the method we mentioned for treatment in the section on division, and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterize it according to three methods, all of which are correct. One of these is that you make three or four lines like the figure of the cautery of the foot, the figure of which has been given previously.
And the thickness between each cautery should be about a finger's width or slightly more, and the manner of performing the cautery should be the same as we mentioned for the foot cautery as well.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; let the patient be awake on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to ignite the cautery having two openings, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and lift the cord that is at the place of the spleen, so that the patient lies on their left side.
And let your elevation with which you lift the cord be according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made according to the breadth of the body.
And then insert the two openings, which are lit, into that opening through which you will penetrate the cord from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and so four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
And then take care of the cautery after it has stopped dripping for too many days, because it is more comfortable than the other previously mentioned causes in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On Cauterization of Dropsy.
Do not make incisions in dropsy patients except specifically for alkantara (a type of bladder stone).
When you treat the patient with the healing methods we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right foot, and another on the stomach. And let the depth of the cauterization be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And immediately remove the cautery open to allow the pus to drain for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment immediately after cauterization with water, but rather add two eggs to them, and fasten them quickly with healing helpers.
The shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be like a nail, as described above, and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as described earlier in its form.
Chapter 32.
On the Cauterization of Feet and Testicles.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with stagnant water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot in the place that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and immediately raise your hand, and do not return it completely, because the stagnant water rises.
The text is written in Occitan, an old Romance language once spoken in Southern France. Here's the line-by-line translation into English: And let there be two cauteries according to the length of the cushion: one above and the other below the middle of the cushion; and on each cushion, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may ooze out of it.
And then treat him with those causes which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the Cauterization of Ventral Hernias
When a ventral hernia is caused by cold and humidity, it weakens the strengths, specifically the digestive and retentive strengths in the stomach and intestines. It is treated with various methods of treatment, but sometimes the patient suffers from the strength exiting [hernia], then cauterize that with a large cautery on his stomach according to what has been said before about the cauterization of the stomach, with the circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle pointed cautery; and with a cautery on the flank above the two larger cauteries, or with two cauteries.
And if the humidity is excessive and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize on the bladder and on the intestines, and firmly place two cauteries on the stomach near the groin, for this is a perfect cure from which there will be no error.
**Capítulo XXXIV.** (Chapter 34.)
About cauterizing old hemorrhoids.
When there are old hemorrhoids or a large humoral coldness or corrupt moisture in the nature of old hemorrhoids, and they have been treated with the water we mentioned earlier and have not recovered, then cauterize them with three cauteries under the little spine of the back and a small triangular one, and with a cautery above the navel through two words.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food not digested, and his face sometimes pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as previously mentioned; and with one cautery on the thigh, and another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cauteries open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
**Capítulo XXXV.** (Chapter 35.)
About cauterizing hernias near their swelling.
When you cut a hernia, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then introduce that into the cut hernia, and continue with your hand until you reach the vein's orifice from which the blood comes. ️
And do this once or twice, because if the pains are too much, then cauterize each of them as we have explained, and then treat them with something appropriate from the ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on the throat, it is more effective in treatment.
Chapter .xxxvi.
On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed in nature, especially in certain parts of him.
When nature does not comply with the work recommended for it, and the patient is disturbed by this, he should be cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the rear part of nature and it is old, corrupt blood and humidities come out from it. And therefore what is most fitting is that you probe that with a fine needle, and then know the quantity of its depth with the aforementioned needle.
Then ignite the cautery that resembles a ray [of sunlight]. And then place that ignited cautery into this fistula, according to the quantity in which you insert the needle.
And repeat the cautery until those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, depending on your need.
And beware of the burning of nerves and veins; or if there is a fistula going towards the bladder or the intestines, then beware of all those places; and do not proceed unless the fistula is in a fleshy and soft place where it does not penetrate.
And now care for the area so that it may heal.
And if the area is sealed and all the matter has been removed from it, and it remains this way for a long time, then you should know that it has healed completely.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then you should know that it is penetrating or entering into the marrow of the bone, which has become corrupt, or this comes from those causes which will be remembered in their place.
Chapter XXXVII.
On the Cautery of Hemorrhoids.
When in the hemorrhoids there is pain from cold or due to great swelling, and because of this the patient's anus becomes numb, then it is necessary that you cauterize above the hemorrhoids with a pointed cautery on each hemorrhoid, as was mentioned before.
And then make a light cautery with the second one right below, so that three cauteries are made in a line, and thus they will be more effective as an aid.

Capítulo 38: Sobre la Cauterización de la Vejiga
Cuando ocurre debilidad y suavización de la vejiga por frío y humedad, de tal manera que el paciente no puede retener la orina, entonces caucere aquella zona, a una distancia justa por encima de la vejiga, en el lugar donde comienzan los pelos del pubis. Caucere con un cauterio en el lado derecho y con otro en el izquierdo del paciente.
Que la longitud de cada cauterio sea según la cantidad de dedos en el pulgar; y caucere aquella zona con un cauterio en el lado inferior de la espalda, o con dos cauterios si es necesario.
Y el cauterio debe ser hueco, según el procedimiento.

Cuando en el útero hay frío y humedad, lo que impide la concepción, las mestruaciones se corrompen, su aparición se retrasa y se produce dolor alrededor del vientre, entonces debe caucerese esa zona con tres cauterios alrededor del ombligo, como hemos dicho en la cauterización de la vejiga; y con un cauterio debajo de la espalda, o con dos cauterios, y el cauterio debe ser hueco.
"Capitolo quaranta
"About cauterization for ankle dislocation.
"When wet mucus is infused in the ankle area and this causes the bone to leave its place, a sign of this is that one leg appears longer than the other when compared. "And the location of the dislocation is found in the concave part of the ankle.
"Then you should cauterize the patient on the ankle area with a circular-shaped cautery, because you will sense with your finger in the circle of the area as it turns, and thus the center of the circle falls into the middle of the area.
"And the shape of this cautery should be similar to that used in stomach cauterization.
"And if this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
"And the cautery should be made according to the thickness of the entire tendon, and then care for it until it heals.
"Capitolo quarantuno
"About cauterization of the sciatic vein.
"When pain occurs in the ankle area and its cause is coldness and moisture, the patient should be treated with the water we have mentioned earlier, but if it is chronic, then you must remove the patient's thick humors using stinking pills or artificial pills; and then cauterize them." ️
And the manner of the cautery in that case is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medications or cautery with fire.
According to two scientific methods, one of which is to cauterize on the patient's shoulder blade with three triangular cauteries in this manner; and make them at a good depth. And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, whether the cauteries are small or large.
However, sometimes the cauteries can be placed in the middle of the shoulder blade for a total of four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle that precedes the form in the cautery for shoulder dislocation, which should be a complete and burning circle on the tip of the whole shoulder blade.
And this is the manner of cautery for sciatica when pain is confined to the shoulder and does not extend into the chest.
However, if the pain extends into the chest, then cauterize with two cauteries on the chest in the place where the patient indicates the pain is located; and with one cautery on the clavicle about four fingers below the inner side.
And if the cautery is blade-like, then let its depth be according to the thickness of the cord.
And if the patient indicates that the pain has spread to other parts of the body, then cauterize those areas as well with the cautery in three or four places, or more if necessary.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the navel towards the hip, then cauterize that area with a blade-like cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not burn too deeply with the cautery to the point of burning nerves or large blood vessels, as this could cause harm or damage to the patient.
And I have seen some who cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, until the flesh swelled up to the point that the tumor reached the foot, and it was pierced and completely corrupted. And soon after, severe abdominal pain followed, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
And the wise ones say in the cauterization of water, use this method: make it like a circle of iron, whose circumference is half a hand's length; and let its holes be according to the thickness of a finger or less.
And within that circle, there should be another third; and the space between them should be the width of a fist; and those circles should be open on two sides; and the length of those ropes should be one fist or two fists, and make on those margins a decent iron border around the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it turns red and emits sparks, and then place it on the open area of the ulcer, with the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that area with three circular cauteries at once.
Then let it be left for three days; then apply a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Al-Zahrawi says: Oh, my son, we have used this type of cautery very little because of the fear of handling it, and because few people are found who know how to handle it.  This passage seems to suggest that there was a level of caution or fear associated with using certain types of cauteries, perhaps due to their perceived danger or complexity. The phrase "paucs havem trobatz les quals reguardan sobre lu" could also be interpreted as "few people are found who dare to handle it.
But of the better cauteries, those who have suffered from them and found relief with them.
This text appears to be discussing a medical procedure involving the use of a cautery and medicine, as well as creating circles with perforated armor in which to place the iron door's handle. Here's a possible line-by-line translation:
E if the spaces which are between each finger are opened both below and above, and they are such that they contain themselves between them in this way:
And then place the patient lying on their left side with you pressing your hand on that part of the ankle; and immediately take hot water and pour it between two circles, and let its heat increase little by little, and maintain this for about one hour, until the patient feels the biting and the swelling subside — because this treatment has a similar effect to fire — until the pain stops.
Then immediately raise your hand with the instrument and wash away all the hot water from the ankle with cold water.
And then leave it alone for three days and place a border on it until the blackness of the swelling has disappeared, and leave it like this for some more days, and a blister will form; this is known as maturation.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the hip or thigh, make a cast for them that contains water in the same way as done with the ankle.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines. Recipe for alkali and lime that is not extinguished from both parts, one part each, grind them and place in a new pot, the bottom of which has been pierced with a small hole according to the amount that enters the vessel.
Place another pot underneath the first one, and pour over the alkali and lime some hot water that covers them by about an inch. After compressing them well with a cloth, allow the acrid water to drip into the lower pot.
And then collect all that water and pour it over fresh lime and alkali, because at this point it will have a strong acidity, which is administered in various medical operations and for the cauterization of other members, as it has a burning effect.
And some of the medicines with which it is cauterized include honey, melilot root, and lime mixed with soap.
And Galen recounted from an ancient man the operation and treatment with which pain of water and sciatica is cured, and he greatly praised it, saying that no other treatment is needed, because once it is treated as described, it will never return, for he himself was cured of this condition by entering a bath.
And it should be taken from fresh horseradish, and if fresh is not found, take a recent fig; and both should be crushed with a little gray salt and placed on the joint where there is pain, or in the knee, or in the thigh, and bound.
And it should be left for a duration of three hours or for as long as the patient feels relief from the pain.
And then have that person enter a bath, and when their body is reddened, exit them from the water, for the pain ceases and they are healed.
And know that it is not necessary to use cautery with these medicines except during the evacuation of the body.
But Escorides says that when the vein is cauterized with a goat's hair, it benefits the patient more; and let the cautery be done in this way: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and between the fingers.
And then take a dry goat's hair and burn it with fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool, spreading it well. And then repeat this process, and do not stop doing so until the sensation of biting reaches into the joint and relieves the pain.
And this method of cauterization is called "cautery of the cow.
Chapter XLIV
About the cauterization of back pain
Sometimes pain in the back is due to too many causes, such as by falling or being struck, or by excessive evacuation, and for similar reasons, by the infusion of cold, wet matter.
And do not perform cauterization except in this one type [of back pain] which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is appropriate to first evacuate the patient with powdered pills and similar ones, which should be made on the back where there is pain in three lines according to its size, for in each line you can cauterize one or more [points], depending on the patient's tolerance and the strength of the [remedy].
And let cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries in a median line, like this:

About the cauterization at the beginning of jaundice.
Many times this illness occurs in small children, and the sign of its beginning in children is that it happens in their limbs at night with swelling and movement.
And you will find in the last vertebra of the back and in his buttocks that it begins to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular in shape like this. so that the cautery takes effect on all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three lines (inches). And let the points be close together.
And then care for the area so that it heals with what has been said.
But beware that the cautery is not administered in a swelling caused by a nerve spasm.

On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain
When joint pains are caused by cold humors that infiltrate each member of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And therefore, when gout of a cold cause is cured with the method of treatment and the pains are not removed, then remove them with cautery.
"And you should cauterize the surrounding area of the foot's joint with many small cauteries.
"And let it be an olive-shaped cautery, which has this form:
"If it is necessary to make a point on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. "And if the pain moves into the toes or other joints, and this happens many times, then you should cauterize each toe with three or four small cauteries on all sides using this olive-shaped cautery.
"And if many small cauteries are necessary, then cauterize with the caution that you do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery beforehand; it should only be as much as the tip of a thread.
"And if the pain moves into the toe and the big toe, then administer the cautery that we mentioned in its chapter.
"And if the pain is only in the fingers, and it is called gout, then prick in the area of the joints like this: prick along these two lines.
"And if there remains pain in the fingers, then prick around the joints on each finger and at the base of the thumb.
And if the pain spreads near the shoulders or the muscles after some days, then burn/cauterize each of those [areas] in all parts of the limbs.
And do not evacuate the patient with good care and the reception of medicines, because if good care is taken and fever is evacuated by this cautery, it will heal, God helping.

On Cauterization of Wounds
When a wound occurs in the abdomen and the intestines protrude before the hernia, and this begins to happen, then it is necessary that you order the patient to leave their food on that day and use lenitive remedies so that the opening of their belly is not widened.
And then follow the patient between your hands on their back, and command them to keep their breath held until either the hernia or the intestines are thrust out or appear.
And then return that [patient] with these words and signs, trying the rupture on the pubic bone with the signal being the extreme point of which is similar to half a circle at the upper parts of the body.
And then ignite the cautery, the form of which is this:
It seems like the text is referring to some sort of treatment or procedure involving heat and small pieces or chips (cintilhas). Here's a possible line-by-line translation into English: And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant on their legs, and another on their feet, holding his hands.
And then place the cautery on that spot with your hand holding the cautery straight, and press until you can feel the bones of the small toe in the middle of the toe; and repeat this another time if you did not succeed in the first attempt to reach the bone.
And be careful about the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine and cause death or other great harm to the patient.
And know that when with the cautery you do not feel the bones, your operation will not be effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be fine according to their size and measure.
And then care for the cauterized area for three days with compresses until the scar of the fire is removed.
And then treat him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are healed.
And you should give the patient food according to the length of time needed for their recovery, which will relieve their stomach, and prevent the intestines from coming out due to the effort of healing.
And when one wishes to rise after about forty days, then administer a well-made ointment decently, and keep it for another forty days.
And let them be restrained from labor and the abundance of food and drink, and loud voices, for when they follow this entire regime of healing, they will be healed.
And I will tell the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if they do not stop at the beginning, then cauterize the rupture with a rounded cautery according to its size, and let what is drawn out from the intestines be as much as the third part of it; and afterwards treat it with what we have said, and it should heal.
And some people say that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is indicated by experience.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
"Chapter 46.
"On the Cautery of Hemorrhoids.
"When in some members due to a fall or a blow, pain persists for a long time and does not subside with medical treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
"And the cautery for each member should be according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, and the location of the swelling or pain.
"Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be spread from member to adjacent member, so you should heal them with cautery until the patient is cured.
"Chapter 47.
"On the Cautery of Leprosy
"Lepers are sometimes healed with a cautery for great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
"And so when you want to cauterize that, consider if the leprosy is contagious and whether it can be cured with water as we have said in the division, and do not say this, and fear that corruption will spread throughout his body and all of his complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second lower than that, at the hairline; and two on both temples; and one behind, on the nape or occiput.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Based on the provided context and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, I'll translate the text line by line:
And be careful of the nerves that are on the ankle, lest you burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the patella and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the thigh.
And know that the more you adjust the cauteries, the more beneficial and effective they are; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the members and joints, as has been said before in the tools' specifications.
And then cure the cautery with flour mixed with honey and other healing ointments until it is healed.
Chapter XLVIII
On the Cauterization of Stupor.
When some member is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it does not heal, then you should cauterize that numb member with cauteries according to the size of the member, whether large or small.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the cord a little bit. And then cure it with ointment until it heals.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the given text:
"But do not presume about this unless you are wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of the nerves that move throughout the body.
"Chapter 49.
"On the Cauterization of Warts
"When a wart is old and you cannot heal it with any of the medicinal ointments, then cauterize it with a pointed cautery for a short time, according to the size of the wart's head, until its whiteness and color are removed and its color has changed.
"Then care for it with a poultice made of oats and lentils mixed with rose oil and rue leaves, and either pigeon or swallow's blood, each being one part, all mixed together. Then soak a cloth in this mixture and place it on the spot until it is healed.
"Chapter 50.
"On the Cauterization of Crabs (Scabies)
"When cancer begins and you want to stop it, then cauterize the area with a circular cautery around its circumference as it is turned.
"And the wise say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of the spot; but I have not seen this, because I fear it may cause an ulcer, and I have seen this happen before.
And it is more appropriate that he be cauterized around his circumference with a circular tool as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter .2
On the Cautery of the Tongue.
When the tongue is delayed in healing, and this happens due to superabundance or because of the patient's condition, which is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the healing of the tongue; then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; and thus you will leave it so that it will hasten in healing.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose shape is as follows: and place that in the middle of the tongue until it penetrates the glottis.
And if you cauterize in that place which is lower, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter .32
On the Cautery of the Ear.
The ear is a corruption walking in the member, which corrupts it as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see that the corrosive area has been treated with a cautery using fire, then use heated cauteries with few small and large needles as appropriate for that particular corrosive area.
Then cauterize that (area) completely until you have removed all the corrosion and there is no trace of it left.
And then leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized areas a dressing of oil mixed with wool until all the scabs are completely removed and all corruption is gone.
Then treat that area with flesh-regenerating ointment.
But if after three days you see that the flesh is healthy and there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on those areas where there is still corruption.
And sometimes the corrosive area is treated with sharp medicine, because that is a substitute for cautery. However, cautery by fire is more effective in providing relief from pus.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division, so take that when you encounter difficulty with it.
Chapter 53
"On cauterization of wounds and other similar conditions.
"Many times it is observed that the parts affected by the sick foot are called wounds, and they are caused by an invasive force that harms the foot; and caution is exercised in these matters in two ways: by fire cautery and by hot water cautery.
"However, fire cautery is that you heat the pointed cautery similar to a bird's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size of the wound in all its parts, and it should have sharp edges.
"Then place that heated [cautery] on the wound, and then rotate your hand with the cautery around the circumference of the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. "And leave it there for three days until it begins to scab over. "And then bandage it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the bandage on overnight, for this will cleanse it of its impurities.
"Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
"And if [the wound] does not heal, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should administer cautery with hot water to those [areas]. And it is that you take a small tube made of brass or iron or a bird's beak, and place it on the wound; and then pour into the tube a small amount of hot water, and hold your hand [steady], and rotate that [tube] with the compression of your hand in all directions, and press the edge of the tube against the impurity of the wound, and you will find that the hot water will penetrate to the depth of the impurity; and let the patient endure the sting of the hot water for about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its impurities will thus be cleansed.
Based on the given context and similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
And then care for those abscesses whose causes are eradicated with the water of ointments that generate flesh.
Chapter 43.
On the Cautery for Tremors
When one has a tremor due to cold in the nerves or from a fever of cold cause, or for a similar reason, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries, or five, on the spine of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and also make a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, making an olive-shaped cautery.
And the tremor will cease, and the health of the cold illness will be restored quickly.
Chapter 55
On Cautery for Sudden Attacks on the Body
When the body is afflicted with sudden boils and pustules that are made of thick, corrupt matter, then at the beginning when it appears, it must be cauterized over the entire head of the fistula with a fine cautery, the end of which is extended with fire; or with long, thin razors; or with lenticular cauteries.
And sometimes it is cauterized additionally at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed to be dangerous, and the superfluity causing those [boils] is disrupted, and they heal from them.
Based on the context provided and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Based on the context provided in your previous translation, "Capitol lvi" likely refers to a chapter or section title in the medieval medical treatise. In English, this would be translated as:
Regarding the procedure of cauterizing a wound caused by an arrow shot.
When treating an arrow wound that has caused an incision, you should first clean the affected area of any foreign matter or pus from the wound or cauterize the limb itself. If this is done in a similar manner, it will be difficult for the wound to become infected again.
Therefore, when you encounter someone with a wound, first cover the opening of the arrow wound tightly with your hand and press on it firmly until the bleeding stops under your finger, ensuring that no blood escapes.
Then place the olive-wood cauteries, both small and large, in the fire by a few counts, and blow on them until they are red hot.
Then take one of these (cauteries), either small or large, according to the place and wound where the artery is broken. Quickly apply it to that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is abated and constrained.
And if the blood continues to be expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and take out the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this until the blood is constricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, lest another evil come upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in that case, especially if the artery is large, unless by one of these four methods: either with a pointed cautery as mentioned above, or by extraction if it has not yet been extracted, because when it has been extracted, its extremities are burnt and the blood flow is restricted; or it should be tied with thread or a bandage for a strong constriction, or medicines that have the power to restrict blood flow should be placed on it; and they should be pressed firmly with a cushion.
But he who administers proper constriction with a bandage and a strong knot with cloth or by the position of cauterizing instruments and similar things should do so only tardily.
But if this is necessary for someone and neither the physician nor medicine is present, then apply pressure with the aforementioned finger on the opening of that vein as mentioned above, and ensure that the constriction is very strong so that the blood stops flowing from the main wound, and do not remove the said finger from the artery; and over the artery, pour cold water until the blood congeals and thickens; and be sure to seek out someone who can perform cauterization or apply necessary medicine.
"De incisio e perforacio e ventozas e de fleubotomia e de plaguas e de lor semblants" translates to "Of incisions and perforations and ventouses and phlebotomy and of wounds and their likenesses.
"Ja havem dit en le primier capitol tota malautia en la qual cauteri am foc es convenient e am medicina comburent, e las occasios e las causas de lu, e les instrumentz en aquels necessaris am las formas dels cauteris; e he ordenatz les capitols de la subiranetat del cap entro als pes" translates to "We have already mentioned in the first chapter all ailments for which cautery with fire is suitable and beneficial, as well as the causes and occasions for it, and the instruments necessary for this with the forms of the cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters from the superior part of the head down to the feet.
"E yeu procesire en aquest capitol per aquela meteysa guisa, per que sia alliujat lo querent aquo, lahoras sobre aquo que aura demandat" translates to "And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be relieved of it, when he has asked about it.
"E denant que yeu comence aquo, cove, fils, que aprenguatz que en aquest capitol es per terror aquo que es en le capitol primier de cauterizacio" translates to "And before I begin this, it is necessary, my son, that you learn that in this chapter there is an error that is in the first chapter on cautery.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence into English: And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most cases, death.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for sometimes it can cause you to behave like a madman with many illnesses. And there are some who will go mad with their illness and die easily, this because of the severity of what they find in their illness, and the length of their illness, and with illness comes fear which signifies death.
And among those is the one who gives you his property and possessions, hoping to recover from you; but his illness is fatal.
Therefore, it is not necessary for you to agree with the one who comes to you in this manner; and your caution should be greater than necessity and greed; and do not presume any cause except certain knowledge that confirms what is good for you, and which brings about a successful outcome.
And use in the care of all your sick the prognosis and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that you will have help in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
O, children, may God inspire in you His understanding and not remove your direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, following what was mentioned in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head down to the feet, so that you may find relief in what you ask and need regarding this matter.
Chapter One.
Of the care of water that is contained in the head of children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children at birth and when the nurse tightly wraps the child's head without loosening it.
And sometimes it happens due to a hidden cause which is not known.
However, I have only seen this illness in children, and all those whom I saw died from it, and for this reason I consider it a hopeless case in them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water had a head that was always so enlarged that he could not put his hand on himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the moisture caused it to increase until he died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the tendon and the bone, or it is accumulated below the bone on the joint.
Because if the operation is on that part where the moisture is between the tendon and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary for you to cut into the middle of the head with a fissure in the width, and let the length of the fissure be two nights so that the moisture runs out. And this is the shape of the spatula:
And therefore if the moisture has increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures here according to this manner:
And if the moisture is below the bone, the sign of it is that you see the cracks in the head open from every side and the water is pressed out when you press that place with your hand inside, and it does not hide from you. It is necessary for you to cut into the middle of the head with three fissures according to this manner:
Then extract all the moisture through the incision; and then strengthen the fissures with cloths and wool; and then dress it from above with wine and oil for five days, and then remove the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food of little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which considers where the abscess appears and the collection of water, because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right side, or on the left side; therefore, pay attention to the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do this as best you can.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest there be a flow of blood and the patient dies from that bleeding with the loss of fluid.
Chapter second.
When there are cataracts or tumors in the eyes or feet, and they are old and medicine does not help with this condition, then the last resort for this is to make an incision in those two arteries.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you want to incise those [arteries], the patient should raise their head, and then rub the area with rough cloth so that the arteries appear; and then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and then check where the vein beats; and press on the places of each one in the places near the ears, and they hide themselves in some people.
And then make an incision on the artery with a knife, and then cut each one with the edge of each sharp part reaching into the bone, and let that be for the length of the head.
And if you wish, insert the knife below the artery and tear it open at the points where the parts are above.
And let the length of the incision be two fingers wide, because when any vein is cut, the blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the incision, then you must measure from the ear the space of three fingers, and then make an incision with a knife, and penetrate into the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let out is one-sixth of a cup, and no more or less than this, and all this depends on the condition of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then consider the wound, and therefore if there remains on the bone any cause of decay, then cut it open so that it does not become a hot abscess.
And then strengthen the wound with compresses and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter III.
Of the removal of arrowheads which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic headaches or acute migraines due to humoral moisture and the quality of the temples' scars, or if an old sore becomes very painful and similar to those conditions, and it is not healed by usual medical methods, then we resort to these maladies for the removal of arrowheads in the temples, or cauterization of those as we have shown.
And the method for this operation and extraction is that the patient shaves the hair from their temples; then they must locate the visible arrowhead in the temple, as it is revealed to you by its pulse, which is concealed in only a few men due to its intensity.
And if it is concealed from you, then let the patient's neck be stretched with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the arrowhead becomes clearly visible to you. And then take the spatula, which has this shape: And then you scrape the cord with it easily until you reach the arrowhead; and then apply a salve on it and extract it slowly until you remove it from the cord and discover it from the tissues that surround it, completely.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And then immediately evacuate from one to three cups of blood.
And if the wound is large, then it is necessary for you to tie that in two places with double-layered linen or with long cords, and do not let putrefaction occur before the healing of the wound, so that there will be no flow of blood.
And then cut off the excess that is between two bindings; and do this at that time or another nearby hour.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery to the bone with a cutting cautery until the edges of it are cut, and keep it in place for the same work.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or hot complexion; because cautery is of those causes that help in finishing humidity, and therefore it is better for healing.
And it is appropriate for the extraction of wounds that the place be covered with an ancient cloak, and let well-prepared powders be placed upon it, and then let it be treated with dry medicines that make the flesh grow and with compresses until it is healed.
And if during the operation another time there is a flow of blood from the wound, then you should quickly restrict that blood, either with cautery, or by filling the place with cloth, and keep your hand pressed until the bleeding stops. And if any of the above causes are not present, then place your finger on the wound until the blood clots, and wash the area with very cold water until it feels numb, and then bandage it as needed.
And the lightest way to remove an arrow from the body is by cauterizing the vein with this two-bladed cautery. First, you must indicate both locations with a probe and apply very hot irons until they reach the bone, splitting the vein into two parts, so that what is between them may be elongated because it is not entirely solidified with this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the two blades have less sharpness, it is better, because if they are too sharp like two needles, they will cut the flesh quickly and not cauterize properly.
Therefore, because of their thickness, heat is retained in them, and the flesh is only slightly cut.
And this procedure is better for all cases and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be as thick as a finger.
Chapter Four.
Of the care of the body from acute and acidic tears of the eyes.
When the tears are acidic and come from those veins that are on top of the head outside, and you do not know any cause for this medical treatment, sometimes the face of the patient becomes red and he feels crawling on his forehead as if it were ants walking, and the eyes of such a person are weakened, so much so that their eyelashes are bent downwards, and the eyelids are cut by the sharpness of the tears, the old doctors used to perform this treatment for these cases, and they named this treatment with the sponge.
And you command the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead, and then you make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead according to its length. And if the length of the incision is two digits: let one incision be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the small movement of the little fingers that are in the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries that are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. › "And if the space between each incision is adjusted to three digits' width.
And if you have a sponge or dry cloths prepared, use them to soak up the blood.
And then insert a probe with two pointed ends, which is the shape of the incision for him: "which extends from the temples to the second incision. "Excise with it all the cord that is between two incisions and the suture that is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. "And then push this probe and insert it into the first incision again; then use another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one end and blunt on the other.
"And place the sharp edge of it against the flesh next to the cord, and the flat side against the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle fissure, and with it cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
"But continue the incision until it appears below the cord, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And since an excessive amount of blood flows out, apply pressure to the areas where blood is flowing.
And immediately place on each crack some old cloth, and place over those powdered with wine and oil and vinegar, to ensure that it does not become a pustule.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage and administer a large infusion of hot water or tea, and then treat it with a basilicum ointment mixed with rose oil and other ingredients until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5
About the treatment of cataracts and ulcers that descend from within the head.
When someone has sharp and continuous cataracts, and sometimes the eyes of the patient are weakened and small, and their vision is dimmed, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hair falls out, and there is a severe pain in the head with subsequent vomiting, know by these signs that the material and cataracts do not come from outside but proceed from some veins within the head.  (This translation assumes "motas" means "some" or "a few," as it seems to fit the context better than other possible meanings.)
And the best treatment for this is as follows: tell the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a small one in size (and begin with the left temple incision towards the right temple; and let the incision be deep into the bone; and keep your hand away from the temple's sutures which are bad due to chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Translation of the sentence: "And then squeeze it firmly with powder mixed in wine and oil, so that it does not turn into a suppurating ulcer.
"And when you release it and see that the pus has diminished, then rub the bone inside until new flesh begins to grow. Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of new flesh. For example, take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mix them together, make a poultice from the mixture, and apply it to these sores to promote the growth of new flesh.
"Chapter VI
"On the treatment of that which falls into the ears.
"Anything that falls into the ears is one of four kinds, either it is mineral matter such as stone or iron or glass, or it is vegetable matter such as seeds or beans, or it is liquid matter such as water or vinegar or their likenesses, or some small animal.
"And therefore when stone or something similar to the above mentioned things falls into the ear and does not fit or grow in the ear, place the ear towards the sun, and if you see the stone, then drop some olive oil or sesame oil on it, and then administer the extraction of it, make the person sneeze with condiments, and open their nostrils so that the sneezing will happen. And then place around the ear some pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear towards its usual position, because these remedies are usually effective for this cause.
And if it is not cured, then administer an extraction with the instrument called "gesti epicicarios subtil," of which this is the form:
And if it is cured with the instrument, that is good; and if not, then administer an extraction to him with a thin lancet of small size.
And therefore, if it is not cured by this method, then make a reed pipe and insert the tip of the pipe into the ear canal and close the area around the pipe with wax and softened oil so that only the pipe remains open. Then extract with your mouth using strong suction, because this has been proven to be effective.
But if it is not cured in this manner, then take a piece of burnt alum or old vinegar and with which birds are caught, a small quantity on the tip of your finger, and place it at the edge of the ear, and then wrap it over that area that has been placed decently. And then gently insert it into the ear canal with ease, and then dry the ear of any moisture.
And therefore if it is not healed with all the causes that we have recounted, then you must cut it before it becomes an abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the saphenous vein according to their strength, and then make a cut between your hands and turn the ear upwards into two parts, and make a small incision in the rear of the ear where their grey matter is most prominent. And let the incision be in the shape of a crescent moon until it reaches the bone, and once the bone is reached, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then close the incision at that moment quickly, and care for it until it heals.
And if the cause of the condition in the ear is one of the waxes that has grown and become inflamed, then administer treatment and removal of it; but if it does not obey your efforts, then take fine, subtle sputum according to this form: And with this, administer to that person the absorption of that pus which has gathered in the ear.
And do not do this when you think that person is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place them in a warm bed, and then carefully extract it with tweezers or fine thread, or by absorption as we have said, because it makes the extraction easier.
But when water has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to sneeze at the beginning, and fill his ear with some old cloth, and pour over that ear in which the water is, and if this expels it, good; and if not, then take some heated stones according to the length of the finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and the patient should insert one into the hole of his ear and jump on one foot from that side and strike with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not stop this procedure with a stone until all the water has been expelled.
Therefore, do not stop this procedure with a stone until all the water has been expelled. And once the water has been expelled, take some paper or cloth and insert one end into the ear, and extend the other end over the fire until it is burnt to a cinder.
And then place another cloth and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and straighten that with a canula as mentioned above about the stone extractor.
But in the case of a foreign body entering that ear, if it is a small object, handle and treat it similarly as we have said in the division; however, if it is a large object causing pain in the tympanum, then administer its extraction with tweezers and a hook, and it will be easier to remove than any other cause that might occur in the ear.
But in the case of removing a worm that has developed in the ear, when you treat it with water as we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and if your treatment does not work, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight.
And so if any cause of the worm appears here, then extract it with tweezers or fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a canula that is narrow at the end and wider at the other end, whose shape should be like this: And insert the fine end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and then suck out with it by forceful suction, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And let your effusion be with which you pour the medical oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the shape. And make it of silver or iron, narrow in size, with a small opening, and flat on top.
Therefore, let it be prepared so that it fits into the cavity of the cannula used for continuous infusion when necessary. And if you wish, take the reed and wrap it decently around the end of the cannula, then put oil or juice from some herb, or water with any of these medicines into the cannula — which is in the ear —, then insert the reed wrapped around the cannula on top and squeeze with your hand until the oil is released into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is introduced into the ear should already be heated slightly with fire. And take care that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for the ear medicines do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII
On the treatment of ear infections.
Sometimes in children, even the unborn, and sometimes in men, there is an infection in the meat of the ear due to a wound or rotting flesh; and this infection sometimes occurs in the anterior part of the opening of the ear which does not see the light, and sometimes it is in the parts outside.
And that which occurs in his stomach, which does not include vomiting, is among the most difficult conditions to heal.
And in that case where vomiting occurs, it is necessary for you to place the patient's ear towards the sun and observe him/her closely. And if you see an apparent swelling, open it with a thin spatula of this form:
If the affected area is small and one end is sharp while the other is not; and if the spatula is two fingers wide, so as not to harm the ear.
And if the swelling is due to flesh growing in the ear or its canal, then take it with subtle scissors and cut vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is in the ear canal, then take a thin reed and heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.
And if you find a swelling with water that the patient has easily, due to heaviness of hearing, relieve the pressure with ease; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
And then place in the ear a piece of cloth according to the width of the hole which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some herbs and dip them into vinegar, then sprinkle over it after it has been dried and use it; and if you see the ear already forming pus, then it is necessary to remove that herb and replace it with another herb which you will wrap in a dressing made of rose oil, until the pus subsides; and then cure it until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use other cures that restrict the flow of blood, which is called distillation in the treatise.
Chapter VIII
On the treatment of pterygium which affects the eyelids.
Pterygia that affect the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet, and at other times they are dry.
Therefore, you should keep them with tweezers or scissors, and cut them off with the edge of their roots, and then place over the areas after they have dried.
If the pain is accompanied by a flow of blood, then you should cauterize that area with a subtle ant-shaped cautery.
And the best cautery is performed near the incisions and wounds that are seen to recur when there remains any cause of their origin; and when they are cauterized with fire, those causes are burned away and do not return.
Chapter IX
Treatment for inflammation that affects the eyelids of the eyes.
Often seen in the eyelids of the eyes is some cause which resembles inflammation in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called inflammation.
And it is an accumulation of thick fluid under and above the eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider if the inflammation proceeds from within and appears from the eyelid and spreads in all directions; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, make an incision over it with the tip of the lancet, and then carefully remove all of it with ease until it is evacuated, and then suspend it with thread and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you should close it with a stitch; and care for it until it is healed.
And if it is small, then you will not have trouble with that because the ointment of it will heal that and skin over it.
And if the wart is declining towards the inside of the eyelid, you should lift up the inner surface, then elevate the eyelid and suspend the wart with a hook, or something that you can hold from the beginning, and press on it from all sides. And if the eyelid is lengthened by the wart, this will not be noticed in any way.
Then at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the place with what causes skin to form until it is healed.
Chapter X
About the treatment of a wart on the eyelid above the eye.
A wart is a growth that appears on the membranes of the eyelid above, and it mainly affects children, damaging their eyes and causing them to squint excessively; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears gather in their eyes.
And for this reason you see these children always squinting on their faces, and sleeping with their faces squinted; and so the membranes of their eyelids are moistened, which have already covered inflammation, and the sign of an impending cataract is evident in the eye; and that when you press the place with your fingers, you feel cataract inside.
This is an intricate passage describing a medical procedure. Let's break it down line by line:
Based on the context and the pattern of the previous translations, here's a possible line-by-line translation:
Based on the pattern and context of the provided text, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
And be careful not to put anything in the opening, for with the spatula you may not reach the wound and thus make it worse.
But if you do not find the arrow in the beginning of the opening, then put a small cloth into the opening for ease until the arrow comes out; and then remove it as we have said; and then submerge some cloths of him in water and vinegar and place them over the area and tighten those with bandages.
And then rinse with salt water and place it in the cavity of the opening, so that any remaining moisture is absorbed.
And then care for it until it heals.
But if a carbuncle occurs in that place, then treat it with cedar plasters until it heals.
Chapter XI
Of the ways of treating the wound.
When hairs are born under the eyelids of the eyes, below the natural hairs and become old, then those cause harm to the eye and lead to various ailments such as constant tearing and softening of the eyelids until it causes destruction of the eye, which is called wounding of the eye. This is treated in four ways: by cauterization with fire; or with sharp medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; or by treating the wound through incision and suturing; or with reeds, as I will explain.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
"However, it is important that the shape be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, because this varies among people; some require a large quantity to be cut from the eyelid, corresponding to the degree to which the eyelid has become softened.
"Then open with the spatula along both lines that you have marked, beginning from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct. "And if your cut is near the natural hairs, as in the thickness of the king.
"Then place a scalpel in one of the two angles of the corner, and then scrape off all of that, and then join together with stitches both lips with glue or fine wool thread, and cleanse away the blood, and make adhere what remains of the threads on two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do this, otherwise do not worry about it.
"Then remove the stitches within three or four days, and then treat it.
"And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid will rise due to the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; but stitching is better, and therefore I say this as do the ancient authorities on healing.
"However, during the operation on the patient, it is important that you are skillful and that the procedure goes well, without fear.
"And there is another method for cauterizing, which involves making an incision on the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then lifting the eyelid with three separate and connected cuts in this manner:
"But if that is not possible, you should make the incisions and ensure they are even. If it is not equal, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure. Insert one end near the larger tear duct and the other end near the smaller tear duct. Adjust the threads so that they are of equal length. Then use these to lift your hand with a gradual elevation, lifting the entire chain on which the cut was made, just as we have described.
"Then approximate and join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it is healed.
"But if an abscess develops at the site of your incision or cut, treat it with a plaster and similar poultice, and with ointment.
"And sometimes the eyelid's hair may turn outwards. In that case, you should use what we have said about incisions; but stitches are more artificial.
To translate the given text into English while maintaining its original meaning, we will proceed line by line: And it is that you should turn the eyelid and cut the figure within as I have described; then, by skill, make two thin canes or needles whose length matches the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a finger. And you have already cut at the ends of each partition where you hold the threads.
Then add each one with delicacy on the overflow of the eyelid’s water, and tighten the canes of each partition with strong tension, and leave it for some days, because the cord by the tension will die and will be denied, and it will fall inward until by itself it falls out.
But if it is delayed, then break it with the scissors, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it has been strengthened, the eyelid will be raised and the hairs will not prick.
And this is the way to make two canes according to this form: and it should have the exact amount of length and width, neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
Of raising prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard and rough, and stinging, then the operation on it is that you take a fine needle and place it in that vein of cedar and lion, and then you must adjust the extremities of it and each knot in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the thread be about the length of a palm.
Then compose another subtle thread underneath it, and quickly tie the ends of that one if you wish.
And then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it be near the sunlight so that your work may be seen clearly, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the adjusted hair that needs to be removed, and make it penetrate quickly through the eyelid until you extract it from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out from above and insert it into the tweezers, and let there be one, two, or three hairs, but no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair is completely removed with tweezers from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the tweezers are pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the tweezers out from below with the thread that you have composed with it, until it is pulled out from above the hole.
And see that one with the vision of the eye, because then you will throw away the axoloti and the needle, and every clavichord will close the eyes, and let the claws be there for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you should attach a long natural hair to it and raise it with that, or leave it until it grows to an appropriate length, and then raise that part.
Chapter XIII.
Of the care for eczema which occurs on the upper eyelid.
When eczema appears on the eye and is a contraction of the eyelid that pulls upwards or to the right or left side due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cautery, it is called leporine eczema. This eczema can be either natural or accidental, caused by poor healing from wounds, incisions, or cauterizations, or resembling their unfortunate condition.  (Note: "Leporina" refers to a type of skin disease similar to eczema.)
The method of operation for this is to cut open that healed area and separate its lips, placing between them a wick made of linen cloth, and binding the lips together until they are healed.
And it is not necessary for you to use a treatment for him due to the causes that dry out and constrict, because if you do this, it returns to the worst condition that he has ever been in.
Use that which softens, such as fenugreek, and soak it in water in which althea and lily seeds have been cooked, or use an ointment made from diaquilon, which should be liquefied with some of the oils, and immerse the cloth in it, and treat with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is to perforate everything that is not consolidated, according to the form it was at the beginning.
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than a rectification of the exacerbation, so that it does not return to its previous state.
Chapter XIV.
On the care of exacerbation that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This exacerbation that occurs in the lower eyelid is truly called "exacerbation"; it is either innate or acquired.
But when it is acquired, it is caused by a blow, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by similar things.
And the way to perform this operation is to take a needle with double thread, insert it into the flesh, and make the thread pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then you extend the flesh at the incision site with the needle and suture it with the needle, and cut wide with a spoon. And thus the shape of the eyelid will return to its original form; if not, take a reed and place it in the split part, and with that you can reshape the eyelid, making two small incisions on the inner side of the eyelid afterwards.
And let the ends of the two incisions be at right angles to each other, so that when they meet, a figure will be formed by their intersection.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
Then remove that piece of flesh by the length of the sharp edge of the needle, so that it becomes an eyelid.
Then join the separated parts and suture them with wool thread; then treat them with the softening medicines and warm compresses that we have mentioned until they are healed.
And if you need to raise the eyelid by means of incision or suture or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the edge of the eyelid as previously described. Then proceed to separate with your finger between two lips as we have said.
At the beginning of the discussion on the treatment of the eyelid, whether it is above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the eyelid form, and this is in the form of various spots.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares an engine in every possible way until he can restore the figure to its natural form, or as close as possible, and this patient, according to what is convenient for him regarding the operation and the instruments, is prepared with the greatest care.
Chapter XV
About the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to some people such that the eyelid is solidly attached above the white of the eye, and is prevented from free movement and its natural functions, then you should insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid, lift it up with that, or extend it with the unguent.
This sentence seems to be describing a surgical procedure, likely involving an incision. Let's break it down:
And let your incision always be made with caution, ensuring that the attachment is removed easily until the eyelid returns to its natural form and all the attachment is healed.
And immediately you should put salt water into the eye with which you wash it; or pour in some hyssop juice dissolved in water.
And immediately separate the eyelid from the eye with a spoon, and place over the eye some wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidating ointments until it is healed.
Chapter XVI
Of the incision of the nail and of the protrusion of flesh on the tear ducts.
Know that the nail is of two kinds, for it is either nervous and resembles thin dry ice; or it is non-nervous, resembling white frozen humidity. When it touches iron, it is taken with pincers and is cut off, but the pincers are not inserted into it.
And both types begin from the larger tear duct, gradually covering the sight and obstructing the light and movement of the eye.
However, the manner of working in its incision is that the patient places their head on your knees, and immediately you open their eyes, raise the eyelid with your hand, and then gather the nail with small pincers and stretch it towards the temples above. Sure, I'd be happy to help translate the text. Here it is line by line: And so you follow that (procedure) by entering the pelvis from behind the patient.
And then you cut the remaining part of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, and clean the natural tear duct tissue to prevent continuous tearing from this incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended or elongated with one of these, as we have said, and then it should be cauterized with a scalpel, which has this shape:
And take care not to touch the corneal tissue with the scalpel and cause a tear, or that the pupil be punctured.
Then place a little crushed salt or cinnamon powder into the eye after the incision, and leave it there until the next day; then wash it with clean water until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, or it is attached to the flesh, then this type of nail can be treated with medications and healed as I have described in the previous section.
And if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient and take a fine scalpel of suitable sharpness like this one: Sure, here is my attempt at translating "am subtilitat": And if you see that it is hardened and hidden within the affected area, then take from your mouth the juice of sage or with chief rue or with salt water, and pour it into the wound until the next day.
Then continue to perform the operation until everything that is from it has been removed, except if there is a contrary pustule in the wound, for then you should leave it alone and treat the beginning of the pustule until it heals.
Then continue your operation on that area with reason until it is healed.
If there is a protrusion of the lacrimal flesh in the wound due to great injury, suspend it with an onion; and incise that from one side, but do not complete the incision so that it does not cause tears to flow.
Then pour in chief rue juice and sage juice into the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
Of incision of the corner of the eye and of the thing that has grown from flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the corners of some eyes, red flesh grows and is placed over the pupil, or close to or pressing on the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids outwards at the sides, resembling a row of balusters.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
And use your incision tool with which you incise those or with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which ashes are collected according to what will be appropriate for this chapter.
Therefore, once your incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, fill the wound with finely ground salt or sprinkle corrosive powder-like medicines over it, and place a bandage of egg white on top until the formation of pus is ensured.
And if there remains any guardian and the flesh is cauterized by blood, and you fear that pus will form, then leave the wound open and treat that pus with water that softens it, and then repeat the operation until it is healed. Similarly, do this for hardened flesh that occurs in the wound of this type.
However, you should ensure that all care of the fresh wound is done by natural or accidental means, such as with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate this operation.
Chapter XVIII.
"Of the collection of pus in the eye.
"The veins that are located on the eyelid are closed and thus prevent the ointment from working, and the eyes are blinded for days.
"Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning for you to consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and there are no other illnesses besides the pus; then you collect that pus.
"And it is that you instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of fine doubleness, like this:
"or two ounces gradually joined in one body like this:
"And then those veins should be collected with fine forces, with fineness, and the blood should be wiped away from time to time until you see that the veins have been removed from the eye and are turned back.
"And be careful not to touch the eye with the tips of the spatula; and if your operation is at noon before the sun, and you are steady in your operation so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
"And when you have completed [the procedure], then you distill into the patient's head pure oil or rosewater, so that with its sharpness it may corrode what has been removed from the wound.
"But if it is not possible to collect everything at that time, then you should bandage the entire area with something that alleviates the patient's pain, and leave them for several days until their pain subsides and they are safe from further infection.
"And then repeat the procedure on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
"And this is the shape of the forceps:
"Chapter XIX.
"On reducing prolapsed tissue in the nose.
"When you treat prolapsed tissue with a cautery or sharp medicine as previously described and it does not heal, do not cut into it, but make incisions over the swelling to allow it to mature, and remove all the moisture within until the bone is exposed.
"And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening in it, then you should scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
"And it is called a 'rasp', and should be made of iron, with a round head like a hook, which should be made porous by filing or finely punctured (as shown in the following figure).
Sure, let's break down the sentence:
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is healed and good flesh has grown back, and the body is cleansed of sickness and remains so for forty days, and there is no recurrence or swelling, and no new problems occur, then you know it is healed.
And if not, then the purpose is not to reduce the split to the shape of the nose, but rather in this manner: you should expose the bone with an iron tool or sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take a file of this form:
The end of the file should be triangular, and its shaft should be first tapered towards the end like this (image or diagram implied).
Then place it on the bone, specifically near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little towards the cheek, and then rotate your hand with the file until it completely penetrates the bone, and the patient will feel relief as they find air escaping through their own hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with drying and astringent medications as you have been taught.
When the flesh is dead and the area is hardened, then the matter that had been dispersed outside returns to the nose, and thus it becomes lighter on the patient.
Chapter 20.
On the reduction of nasal prominence.
When the nose protrudes in its entirety and does not cause any harm or diminution in appearance, then let the patient lie down, and you should follow them, and you should apply cupping to the neck without scarification and good suction; and then place a liniment on the nose that is made of agate, aloe, and enses, and strengthen the plaster on the nose with many fine powders.
And the manner of making the powders is to take many pieces of linen cloth, and each piece should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the quantity that the nose needs. Then strengthen over these with a hard cloth and strong binding; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cups and let the nose stay bound day and night.
"But if in the meantime the ligament becomes softened, then it must be very tight.
And then remove the bandage day and night as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already been reduced, that is good; but if not, then reapply the plaster with the powder and the string and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the incision of the uveal tract's surface layer.
When there is a rupture in the uveal tract, and it protrudes outward through the eyelids like a grain of sand, and its form resembles that of a man, if you wish to incise this, then the operation on it is as follows: insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below and slightly above, and then insert another needle, which should be double-threaded, in the lacrimal part. Make the latter penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; then incise the place of the double thread and lift with it the portion of the uvea around the needle, and strengthen that very much.
Here's my attempt at translating this line:
And then care for the wound with water that will comfort it until the injury is healed.
And sometimes from all around with a circle of cloth wrap the wound tightly, and then pierce it with a fine probe that reaches to the depth of the wound, and let the moisture flow out, and lower the wound and re-enter it immediately.
And then strengthen within until it is healed.
Chapter 22
About the treatment of alconati (likely refers to some kind of eye condition or injury).
This ailment, which is called alconati, is nothing but pus that is trapped in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not that.
But the way to proceed with it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and straight bed, then take his head in both your hands from two sides so that you can see the pus coming out through the edges, and then dry it so that it does not descend, and block the light, and the patient will see things as he sees them.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with water as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine probe and place it on the skin near the edge of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer in the crown (in the place where you want), until the pus is expelled.
When it is forgotten (i.e., not taken), then you should instill in the nostril warm water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the cure for water descending from the nose (i.e., nasal drip).
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and which one is suitable to be pierced with speech, as will be declared according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and tie his nose tightly closed.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his nose, if the nose with the water is the left one; or with your right hand, if it is the right one.
And then with your right hand take some aloe if the nose is left; or with your left hand if it is the right one.
And then place the tip of the aloe near the edge of the nostril on the side of the smaller tear duct, and then peel off the aloe with skill and roll your hand with it.
"And then penetrate into the eyeball and you will feel that the cataract has already reached due to its advanced stage.
"And the measure of the cataract's path should be equal to the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the edge of the black part, and this is the crown of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the clarity of the corneal membrane.
"Then press the cataract into the place where the water is located, and then you pull it down once, and then again another time, and if the water descends immediately, then you can see that the patient will regain their sight quickly, and the cataract in the same eye.
"Then wait a little while; and if the water has descended, then you must stop that other time before the cataract is dislodged.
"And when it is dry and does not descend, then you can easily extract the cataract, and gently revolve it with your hand a little at a time, and then dissolve a small amount of clear salt from rock in water and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or wool soaked in oil of roses and egg white, and bind the eye with water.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And if you do not obey your healer in the treatment of the eye due to its toughness — for it is one of the parts of the body that is very hard —, then you should take the ointment called alberid, which has this form:
Therefore, you should pierce that joint with it, and do not push your hand too far into the hole; otherwise, you will create a path for the healer to reach a delicate spot.
Then, as we have said, the doctor should proceed accordingly.
And you must complete your work by preparing a quiet, dark bedroom for the patient to sleep in on their back, and they should be forbidden from all movements.
And place on his nature something to cleanse his nature, and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the treatment continue according to its course for three days.
Then, release the patient into that dark room and test their vision. Make them look at some objects, then resume the treatment for seven days.
And it is not necessary to do this during the hours of care or immediately after the infusion. Based on the context and similarity to medieval medical texts, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
If an abscess occurs, then it is necessary to release the pus before the seventh day, and correct it with water that will reduce the abscess.
Then you should close the sight of him and place a cloth over his mouth so that his vision is obstructed, leaving him in darkness for several days.
And then gradually remove him from that darkness and converse with him about the causes (of his condition).
And know that in Alchemy, the student is not exempted from certain visions, and then you should be brave about the operation.
And it has come to our attention from some of those who are adept in the Art, and some say that they made fire in the Argar Magdam, which is pierced with which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has mastered this, nor is there any mention of it in the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of Magdam for one who does not know them:
And they are made of iron or steel specifically, and their outer edges should be shaped with this subtlety in a triangular form, with the pointy end like this is the shape.
The text appears to be in Old Occitan, a Romance language spoken in southern France during the Middle Ages. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"About the care of flesh wounds in the nose.
"When in the nose various flesh growths appear, one of which is caused by an organism similar to a scorpion sting or polyp; this condition is called 'polyp' because it resembles that fish. "And if the flesh is cancerous, with foul odor and dark color, it is a malignant growth. But if it is not of dark color, it is a benign growth.
"Therefore, in the case of these benign and non-cancerous growths, it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands and place them in the sun, and frequently blow their nose, and prick them with your needle in those areas. "And then draw that out through the incisions you made earlier, and cut it with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you are sure all the flesh has been removed; for if there remains any part of it from which cutting is possible, then cut it away with one of the fine instruments until nothing remains. "But if the flesh is bloody or forms an abscess, then you must treat it as necessary; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you should cut and cauterize it until blood is drawn and all the cavities are removed.
"And then, put vinegar and water or wine into the nose. "But if the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it has already healed.
"But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that inside there is flesh nothing but pus above the bones of the nose, which has not been reached by the incision.
"Therefore, it is necessary to insert a thread with some thickness, and make three knots, and place between each knot the quantity of the finger or hand, and guide the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nose with the hook or another suitable instrument.
"And after doing this, let the patient breathe in so that it reaches the passages of the nose and comes out through its nostrils, for many times children at school do something similar to this action, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
"Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that comes out through the nose and the other that remains inside the nose, and then administer a stitch of flesh with the knots that are in the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Sure, here is the translation of the provided sentence:
And at the end of the cause, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it is healed.
But if you are in need of another cure, use this one:
And this is the form of the instrument used to perform caput purge with which oils and medications are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or iron, which should be similar to a small open lamp with a small bowl and similarly shaped opening.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the instrument for caput purge should be flat and open; at its end there should be a handle with which you can hold it when you pour into it oil or water, as well as the juices of suckable causes.
**Capítulo XXV.**
Of warts that are born in the extremities of the nose.
A large wart is born in the extremities of the nose and is considered magnificent and admirable on certain days until it reaches a certain size and requires care.
And for this reason, you should intervene as soon as possible at the beginning of its appearance, and remove it completely. Then place a cautery or burning medicine on the area where it was located.
However, if the intervention is delayed until it becomes large, then consider whether it has become hardened, dark in color and less sensitive to touch; in that case, do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous abscess. For warts that are treated by removing this type of abscess often cause great harm to the person on whom they were located.
And if the abscess is tender to the touch and not dark in color, and removal is possible in any case, then evacuate the patient and remove it without fear, and treat the area with astringent water until it heals.
**Capítulo XXVI.**
Of the suture of the nose and lips and ear when continuity is broken by injury or similar causes.
"Know that when there is a separation of continuity in one of these cartilages, it will be beneficial for that operation to be performed only on certain men.
"So then, when someone has some of these causes, consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you should join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and afterwards treat it so that it may heal.
"And if the lips of separation have already been divided and each one is healed, then it is necessary for you to cut away each separated part from its root until blood comes out. "Then join the two lips together with stitches and strengthen them. On top of that, sprinkle some powdered dragon's blood and trisia, and place on the powder a fine linen cloth or one of the other consolidating poultices. Leave it there for two or three days, then remove it and replace the poultice, leaving it until the threads have dissolved on their own, and finally treat with ointment until it is healed.
"However, the method of suturing is that you should bring together the separation of continuity either with needles as we have mentioned in abdominal suturing, or unite the separation of continuity with thread as has been taught to you.
**Capitulum .xxvii.**
**About the removal of those causes that appear on both lips inside.**
**Many times it happens to many men inside the lips of their mouths hardened lumps like the fat of bears, and some are smaller while others are larger.**
**Therefore you should turn the lips and folds each of those hardnesses in all parts, and then fill the place with fine salt until the blood is constricted, and then wash it with vinegar and treat the area with water that has astringent properties, until it heals.**
**Capitulum .xxviii.**
**About incision of the flesh attached to the gums.**
**It often happens that there is flesh attached to the gum, which the ancients called albulus. Therefore you should suspend it with a hook or whatever you have with scissors, and you must cut it back to its root, and let the pus or blood run out.**
**And then place fine salt or other astringent or drying powders on the area.**
**And if that flesh returns, then cut it again and cauterize it, because after the cautery it will not return.**
Chapter 29.
About the cause of toothache.
When in the surface of the teeth, both the molars and the incisors, there are sharp, rough scabs that are sometimes blackish and become citrus or greenish until they reach the gum, which is then corrupted, and the teeth become loose.
Therefore, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest his head in your lap. Scrape the teeth where those scabs appear, causing a sand-like effect until no cause remains, and this will eliminate the blackness, the citrus color, and the others until they are cleaned. ︎
Therefore, if this is stopped and it is as at the beginning of the cause, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the cause on those for another day and the second and the third until it reaches the final stage that you want.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of various shapes and forms according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scrapers with which the molar is scraped are different from those with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of scrapers must be prepared by you as you will see shortly:
It appears that "Capitol .xxx." is likely a chapter or section heading in the medieval medical treatise. This phrase would typically mean "Chapter 30" in English, as "capitol" seems to be derived from the Latin word "capitulum," which refers to a chapter or division of a text.
Of tooth extraction.
Ensure that you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay in its extraction, for there is no cause that should prevent its removal when it is extracted, because it is a sublime substance until its removal.
But when the patient is strongly determined to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is causing the pain, for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, but the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted.  For we have already seen this happen due to the action of nerves.
Therefore, as you must be certain which tooth is painful and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula that has some virtue in it, until the tooth is completely separated from the gum all around, and then move it gently with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little until you have extracted it.
And then take strong tongs for good speech or a firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it firmly and it does not move. Then draw the tooth in a straight manner so that you do not break it, nor cause greater pain to the patient.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under the patient from all parts with ease, and strive for its removal in such a manner as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is crooked or rotten, then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth and tighten it with the tip of a thin thread so that it is not broken during your constriction upon it with tongs.
And it is necessary that you work carefully with incision around all parts of the gum and take care not to break it or leave a part of it attached, and return to the patient for the worse, so that his pain is greater than before.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their arrogance and audacity, removing teeth without administering what we have recommended; for many times they bring great evils upon the sick, which are more difficult to heal than if the teeth had been broken, and the reasons for this are all removed, or some of them, or that you extract it with some bones from the jaw, as has happened many times.
And before removing the patient's hernia, his mouth should be washed with wine or vinegar mixed with salt.
And if there are flows of blood from this, as with many other ailments, then apply some quantity of pitch and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that does not help, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and fine pliers used to remove the tooth at the beginning should be of a long handle, short shank, and thick, so that they are not bent when you have to work with them.
And the handles should be thick enough so that they are not bent when squeezed with them, but their length should be short.
And they should be made of Indian steel with straight handles, and at the ends of those there should be teeth which interlock with each other and squeeze tightly, and sometimes the ends of those should have the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, which is pointed, and are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When the cause of tooth removal is due to breakage, you should place cotton wool with borax on the area for one or two days until it becomes soft; and then introduce tweezers or pliers whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called a stork or heron. The shape of these tools should be like forceps:
And their ends should be made inside like a file or a rasp.
And if the tooth does not give in to extraction with these forceps or pliers, then you should dig into the gum and remove all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called "atali", which is a small lever, as shown below:
And it should have a short, thick end that is not sharp, so that it does not break.
Therefore, if the gum is pierced by this means, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, whose shapes are as follows: the shape of the first instrument is that of a triangle at its end, in which there should be some thickness.
The shape of the second instrument is that it has a triangular and more delicate end.
And having been helped with these instruments, which have two ramps, as shown below: And with other instruments which will be used for scraping teeth; because treatment is done with this instrument that resembles a large thimble, and this is its form.
of the twisted or shortened triangular tip, which should be of some thickness and not pointed so that it does not pierce.
And know that tooth scraping instruments are similar to other instruments in the following ways:
However, a skilled and subtle craftsman in the art will discover for himself according to what the operation and various diseases indicate; because there are diseases for which the ancients did not specify or provide proper instruments due to the diverse forms of different species.
However, if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are fractured or broken, then it should be treated with what is convenient of the instruments and forceps that we have mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and assist yourself with this tool, which has this form.
And it should have some small thickness, and be held in the mouth so that it does not escape or slip until the bone is completely healed; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
If there is a small sore in the bone, then scrape off that sore and its blackness, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
On the treatment of protruding teeth over others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural shape and size, especially when this occurs in women, and particularly in the most venerable ones, you must consider: if the tooth is very close to another tooth and it is not possible to extract or straighten it, then scrape that tooth; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has the shape of a pig's snout and is made of Indian iron, very sharp at the tip.
And let your cutting be done with the instrument that cuts it over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other tooth is cut in the process.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this form:
And let the entire file be made of Indian iron; and let the edge be smooth; and let it have very small points like a file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days gently, so that no other tooth is cut or damaged. And then incise it at the end, and shave it with several razors.
And if it is the tooth from which a fragment has been broken and the tongue is affected, then you must scrape that part so that the roughness of that piece is removed and smoothed, and it should be filled so that the tongue does not get hurt and the speech does not become corrupted.
And if the tooth from which a fragment has been broken and the tongue is affected, then you must scrape that part so that the roughness of that piece is removed and smoothed, and it should be filled so that the tongue does not get hurt and the speech does not become corrupted.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver filings.
When it happens that the front teeth are knocked out or removed by a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew on that side, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, but your treatment has not been effective, then to prevent further injury to those (teeth) which are strengthened with gold filings, and not silver, because silver turns black and becomes porous after some days, but gold never changes.
And let the filings be in such fineness and thickness according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth; and the way to do this is that you take the filings and take twice as much between two healthy teeth, and then gradually increase with two twists of the filings between two broken (teeth), or if one or several, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then you return the tissue into the area where it began, and strengthen your hand with gentleness and skill until it is not swollen.
And let your tightening be with the faith that you must keep the teeth's roots from rotting away.
And then you cut off the excess of the thread with forceps or scissors, and add those in each place with care, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the swollen tooth, so that it does not cause damage to the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened as Roman [people do].
But if it becomes loose or broken, strengthen that or those with another thread in the same manner at all times.
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth and two swollen teeth, as you see these bound together:
And when the teeth are returned to their place, each in its own position, and they grow again as we have described, and they heal.
And only do this if you are a skilled artisan and wise.
And sometimes it is appropriate to use the cause of cow bones, and they are made in the form of a tooth, and placed in the place where the tooth has failed, and strengthened as we have said, and remain and serve with that for a long time.
Capítulo (Chapter) .xxxiv.
Sobre el tratamiento de la úlcera que aparece en la lengua, prohíbe hablar.
Esta úlcera que aparece debajo de la lengua algunas veces es natural con el que uno nace, o accidental y ocurre por una herida que ya se ha curado.
La operación consiste en abrir la boca del paciente, colocar su cabeza en tu pecho; y luego levanta su lengua, y corta esa úlcera nerviosa según la longitud necesaria para que la lengua se cure de su inflamación.
Pero si en ella hay dureza o nódulo, y esto es debido a la consolidación de una herida, entonces frota con ungüento y corta hasta que hayas cortado la úlcera y disuelto el nódulo.
Y ten cuidado de no hacer una fisura en la profundidad de la carne, y que al cortar no dañes el vaso sanguíneo y haya flujo de sangre.
Luego, lava los vestigios del corte con agua clara o vinagre o con agua caliente; y luego coloca un vendaje debajo de la lengua, es decir, una pieza de lino que el paciente llevará debajo de la lengua todas las noches para evitar que se vuelva a consolidar.
Certainly! Let's translate the text line by line into English: And immediately, that caregiver with the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Chapter 35: On the Extraction of a Throat Swelling
Sometimes, a small abscess forms under the tongue, preventing it from functioning naturally, and if not treated promptly, it can swell to fill the mouth.
The procedure for treating this condition is to open the patient's mouth while they are sitting in front of a window and examine the abscess.
And if you see that it is of dark or black color, hard, and the patient feels no pain in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it turns white and is moist, then insert a lancet into it and cut it with a fine spatula from all sides; and if blood comes out during your operation, then place powdered vitriol on it to stop the bleeding.
Then return to your work until you have removed it completely, and wash the area with vinegar and salt; and treat that with other care until it is healed.
Chapter 36
De extraccio de apostema de doas aurelhas e de aquel que es nada en le golayro e de las autras apostemas.
When it comes to the throat, they are glands that resemble cotton, which appear on the outside and are called tonsils. If you treat them with the water we mentioned in the section and they do not heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little feeling. Do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color and the root is large, do not touch it with iron due to the flow of blood; rather, leave it until it is matured. Then you will either pierce it or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, soft, and its root is delicate, then that is what needs to be incised.
And the operation on it is what you consider before your operation: whether the abscess has already been stopped with complete rest or if it has diminished with some reduction; and then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap, open his mouth, and let a servant hold his tongue between his hands, pressing it down with an instrument that is very noble. The shape of this instrument is as follows:
And it should be made of silver or iron, and it should be subtle like a knife.
Therefore, when you press with your thumb against the tongue and an abscess appears, immediately place your handkerchief over it, then take a scalpel and cut into the abscess as much as possible to release the pus. And if you draw out any cause of the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument that looks like this:
And if you draw out any cause of the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument that looks like this: and it is similar to forceps, but the tips of it are curved, so that the orifice of one is in the opposite direction of the other, very sharp, which should be made of iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then incise it with a spatula that looks like this: and let one end be sharp, while the other end is not sharp.
And after you have incised one abscess, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and then the patient will heal from cold water.
But if there is bleeding, heal with water from the decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar to that of the hemostatic causes until the blood flow is stopped, and then care for it until it is healed.
"And sometimes it appears in the groin, other times as abscesses or both ears, and you should treat them as I have said in the treatment of two boils equally.
"I once treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her groin, which was dark in color and caused little discomfort, and it had already closed off her groin, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and I had prohibited her from eating and drinking water, and she would have died within one or two days.
"And the abscess had swollen so much that it formed two humps, which then burst open through two holes.
"So I cautiously inserted my finger into one of the openings and pulled out a large piece of it, and then I cut around the other opening, and closed its mouth, compressing her tongue, and then I inserted my finger into that abscess.
"And then I drained a large amount from it, and only a little blood came out of it. "So the groin of that woman was completely healed, and she began to drink water right away, and then she resumed eating. And I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess developed in its place, which I cut until it elongated.
Based on the provided context and the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here is my attempt at translating "Capitol .xxxvii." into English:
"About the incision of the ankle when it is swollen.
"When the ankle is swollen and inflamed for a long time, it is called 'perpendicular'; and if it swells in the back part, large and round, then it is called 'bubo'.
"But when it is healed with the water that we have mentioned earlier, and you do not complete your treatment, or if sometimes the abscess has already formed and is subtle, then you should incise it in a round shape; and if it extends to that length, and is filled with blood, of dark color or black, and it does not feel firm, then you should attempt to incise it, because there is a risk for the patient.
"And when you see that according to the manner I have described, regarding its whiteness and length, make the patient lie down and press their tongue with an instrument suitable for this purpose, and then place the onyx (a type of stone or gem) in the wound, pull it downward, and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of the two mills.
"And you should not incise it except at the point where it naturally ends without adding anything, because if you incise further, you will damage their speech.
E apropos of the incision, use that which we have recommended in the incision of two apples, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use cunning in cauterizing them without fear. The manner of cautery on them is only with sharp water, and you should place the patient's head on your lap. Then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier, and then take some of the water we have talked about in the chapter on cauterization. Make a live cautery with that and apply it, not too thick or thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument, which has this shape:
Let the patient's extremity be concave in which the medicine is placed, similar to the concavity of a spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer, and let the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth flows from the intrinsic medicine, ensuring that none of it drips onto the patient's throat or causes harm.
Then take your hand with the medicine and press it on the ulcer for about half an hour until you see it become darkened and calmed by the medicine's bite.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the ray (needle), then dip the cotton in the medicine, and insert the ray with the cotton into a cannula so that the cotton adheres to the inside of the cannula. Do this several times until you achieve the desired cauterization effect, and then leave it for about three or four days until it dries up and falls off.
And if you need to repeat the application of the medicine, do so. Then clean the cauterized area with cotton dipped in warm water and clean it with that which is mixed with the medicine. After washing with cold water, treat the outside with ointment and the inside with poultices until it heals.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and lasts longer.
Sometimes the ulcer is cured with something that is more subtle than cautery or incision, because it is healed with sublimation in this way: Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried arabic raisins, chamomile, and similar herbs, mix all of them, or some of them, in a pot, soak them in strong wine, boil; and the pot should be well sealed with good clay, and there should be a small hole in the middle of the pot, on which an appropriate concave instrument made of silver or iron is placed.
And let the extremity be inserted into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the uvula over the palate, until the uvula is quite obscured.
And then rub the moistened area until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the onset of an abscess, because it will tighten the abscess too much, and you should not do that unless the doctor declares the abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and make a knot in its extremity, so that the mouth of the patient is protected, because the knot of the reed prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good with health. (i.e., This treatment is beneficial for one's health.)
Chapter XXXVIII.
Of the removal of thorns and other adhering substances from the throat and other causes.
Moistened areas stick to the throat, or a thorn in the foot, or any other cause.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to remove that which appears from those [areas], on which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument before it, so that what is in the throat may be revealed to you.
Sure, let's translate that line by line: And take an eel and have it tied with a string, and let it be placed inside the table, and when it is removed, another time place a leek there instead, and then remove it as well.
But if you are not familiar with those causes that we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this form:
And let it be thicker than the width of a finger, and at its end let there be a concavity which you can insert into his throat with ease.
And have him raise his head up, and be careful that the touch of his throat bone does not cause injury to his body or dislocate the bone or spine, or what that doctor does with his hand.
However, the one who inserts the instrument should do so better, by his knowledge of the place where the cause is attached and pulls down, and pulls up his hand with the instrument until it is removed.
Chapter 39
Of the removal of a bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with the water we mentioned in the division of treatment without surgery, consider then in the throat of the patient on the right side, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see a leech, extract it with a fine pin or delicate tweezers.
And if it is not possible to remove it that way, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat. Then place an ignited iron in the hollow of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and removed from the throat) and prevent the patient from drinking water for the entire day.
Then take a basin full of cold water and place the patient's mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; do not swallow any of it, but move the water around with your hand for about an hour, because the leech will soon feel the water and detach itself.
But if it is not removed with the water we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with camphor or asafoetida through the instruments that we have recommended for fumigating the soft palate.
Do this until it falls out.
And another method of operation for fumigation is to take a container in which there are burning coals and the container is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole; and place the end of the instrument through that hole; then begin the fumigation; and have the patient place their mouth over the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not dispersed until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will soon fall out.
And if the cat does not work, then you should repeat the fumigation many times, and make the patient abstain from drinking, and have them eat salty foods and almonds, and not drink water, and it is necessary that with this regimen, the illness be forgotten.
And this is the form of the instrument with which blood is drawn from the goiter when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps as you see, except that in it there is some curvature. which should be placed on the goiter, and its extremity is similar to the beak of a stork, which is blunt, and in which there are marks made with a file, so that when we press any part, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discussion on abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are many things, of many kinds, according to what is remembered about them, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision, which is done in two ways: one according to the kind of abscess itself; and the other according to what we understand about the humors.
And the second method is specifically for the places in the body where the abscess occurs, because an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring on the buttocks; and an abscess occurring on a fleshy part is different from one occurring on a joint; and each of them has its own treatment depending on the location.
And there are some abscesses that should not be punctured until the pus within them has matured or their contents have been fully developed.
Other abscesses should be punctured while they are still fresh and not fully developed, such as those near the joints. For when an abscess is near a joint, its nature is prolonged until it can reach something in its vicinity, and quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint become corrupted, which causes contraction of that limb; or if it is near a main limb, and you delay puncturing it until it has matured, it will spread to the main limb; or if it is near the buttocks, then puncture it while it is not yet mature. Do not puncture it when it is raw and unripe, except for those near the buttocks, so that its contents do not spread and become elongated into the inner parts of the buttocks, forming a fistula or causing something at the edge of it to not heal. "But know that the time of the perforation of the abscess is when it has matured.
"And know that it is mature when there is a decrease in pain and fever, as well as a reduction in swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and other signs.
"And it is important to know that the perforation should be made below the abscess and in the place where pus comes out from the treatment of the swelling.
"And the incision should always be made along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the areas of the hands or feet, and in places of tendons, ligaments, arteries; and finally, in all places except those that reflect; because in the reflected ones, use incisions according to that member.
"But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the incision open until its digestion is confirmed according to its course, as we have said; because if you close it before that, the body of the pus and much filth are prolonged, and strongly adhere the lips of it hardened and its depth.
But some abscesses are pierced according to the thickness of the flesh or the body, depending on necessity or according to what the member requires.
And you should administer a small perforation in the case of large abscesses, and make a wide or multiple incisions according to the size of the abscesses.
And others are of the abscesses in which it is necessary for the blade to be concave and incised, when it is made thus like a piece of bread and is done in time so that it may scab, as is done in cases of double boils and buboes.
And among these are those that are incised with a triangular section; and of these is the one which is incised thus like the shape of a myrtle leaf, such as the abscesses of the anus.
And there are those in which a round section and lunar section, similar to these, are administered.
But the one in which there is no head, such as superficial abscesses, you should pierce that with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary that when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, you pierce it and do not be concerned with extracting all of the pus at once; having extracted a part from it, and then close the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and then do this many times according to degree until it is fully emptied.
And especially if the patient is a young child, or a pregnant woman, or an elderly person in decline, because the vital spirit often leaves with the discharge of blood, and the patient dies quickly, and you open them.
In this chapter, act with great care, and when you make the perforation through which you drain these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wounds and consider whether the abscess wound is small or a flat section. If it is small, administer some water of lily or old cotton; but if the abscess is large and the openings are many, then place a sponge in each one until they all come together.
And if in the abscess a part of the cord has been cut or that area is concave, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or a piece of linen cloth, as when you have drawn pans or rags, without moisture; and strengthen that [filling] for three days; and then proceed and cure it with water from the ointments until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, in which you have soaked a piece of linen cloth, and place that over the area of the bleeding many times.
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
If it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should infuse powders in wine and oil, and place them on the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy, then you should place powders soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and do this until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to its cure whatever is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally; but according to the way of distinction, I have already said how each type of abscess should be treated specifically by chapters.
Chapter 41.
About the incision of abscesses that occur in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses occur, and they are of the species of knots which contain tunics that are on their surface; and the species of them are numerous.
And from them come pustules, and some of those contain moisture like pus. And of these are those which contain moisture similar to dust, and resembling them; and of these are those which are stony, hard.
And in the sectioning of all, and in their removal there is no fear, as you must perform the extraction without causing an infection.
And the operation in sectioning of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape appears here, which is called a trocar, until you know what it contains.
Because if what it contains is moisture, then you should cut it with a section following the length with a superficial section according to this form:
And begin the section from the line of .B. to the line of .G. Then, once the moisture is evacuated, you should scrape that place where the moisture was contained, and do not leave any cause in it, because if too much remains, it will return, if there remains any cause in it.
Then submerge the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water with salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until another day, because with water it will corrode all that remains of that membrane.
And then treat the area with Egyptian ointment, applying it thoroughly and carefully if you need to. Do this until you are confident that there is no further cause for concern with that skin layer; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess contains fatty nodes, you should incise it as follows: with a section shaped like a cross, and place the knife between two lips of the incision and scrape it from all sides, and use your strength to extract the membrane that contains it.
But if you encounter resistance while arching, do what I told you at first.
Similarly, do the same for a lithified abscess in both sectioning and curing as we have told you; and sectioning over a lithified abscess is lighter because it contains little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are ulcers of these abscesses that are on the head in some men with whom there is no moisture; and this happens because I incised over an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a deaf, hard, white stone that could not be broken, and if someone were struck by it, they would be harmed.
In the other types of abscesses that occur in the head, this chapter does not cover those that appear on the heads of infants and are due to the reasons of the ears. However, the section on these should all be a superficial section.
Then make the opening of those in their lowest part so that the body is relieved of the sickness in its lower parts.
Then cure them with water suitable for healing.
Chapter 42.
On the section of scrofula which occurs in the neck.
Many times these abscesses appear in the neck and underarms and armpits; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and most of which are engendered there, and all scrofula of those is within its own proper tunic, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said before.
And the species of these scrofulae are many, for there are some that are hard, and some that contain moisture, and some are malignant which do not obey treatment.
Certainly! Here is the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
And it is more cautious that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the spatula not be too sharp, so that it does not cut you on your hand during the incision, or disturb the patient, and do not cut anything unnecessary; for if you were to cut a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from continuing your operation, then press firmly on the wound with powdered vitriol or other hemostatic powders, and compress the wound, and leave it open until the acuity of the inflammation is resolved and the wound becomes softened and begins to suppurate. When the blood is released.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with the same name if there is any other cause of the other scrofulous sores, then incise and cleanse those as well.
And if there is a large vein in the vicinity of the scrofula, it is then better not to incise that scrofula from its vicinity. Rather, it is better to lay a tightly folded cloth over it and leave it open until it heals on its own without harming anything.
And then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut off that scrofula completely, then it is necessary for you to bring together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that there remains no superfluity.
But if you see that there is remaining superfluity due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary for you to understand how to cut off the root of it, and then draw it out and administer the suture as has been said.
And as for those scrofulas that contain moisture, you should pierce it with a superficial puncture where the matured part of it appears to you, and place the puncture so that the pus comes out from below the body, as we have said.
And then administer a puncture, applying ointment and similar things to it, so that it will corrupt whatever remains of the corruption. And then when you see the wound already cleaned, then you should treat it with ointment of flesh-generating properties until it is healed.
### Chapter XLIII
This text appears to be discussing a surgical procedure related to an abscess (apostema). A literal translation would be:
"The ancients said this section is about epilepsy, and we have not seen anyone in our land who has done it.
"And this is the writing of their speech.
"However, in men with sensibility, it is necessary to avoid the extraction of epilepsy, as this cannot be done effectively because all the veins and major parts of the patient are here.
"However, in those who have apostemas [abscesses] in the mouth or gullet or two ears, when the illness is not in the throat, it is necessary to use the section of epilepsy to avoid the loss that occurs through suffocation.
"Therefore, when we want to do this, we must cut the epilepsy just below three circles of the epileptic circles, or four with a small section through the latitude between two circles for quantity, so that the incision is in cartilage, not in bone. This place is suitable for cutting because it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are thin.
"And if the physician is timid, it is necessary that he extend the tendon of the throat with an ounce [a unit of measurement], and then cut the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels if any of those are visible.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And leave the wound open for some time.
When the time has come to close the wound that was opened earlier, bring together the two lips of the wound and sew it shut with only one stitch without the thread.
And then administer medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals.
And Abu Qasim (Albucasis) says that the essence of what we have described is nothing other than when some of these abscesses have already taken over the patient's stomach, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath has become dry, some people go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the place of the wound for some time, and be saved from death.  (Note: The translation is literal and may not be medically accurate or safe.)
And for this reason, he will order the wound to be left open until the evil of the illness is consumed; and its evil lasts for three days; and then he will order it to be sewn shut, and care for it until it heals.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and stuck it in her throat, cutting off a piece of the pulmonary vein with it; and I was called to treat her, and found her as breathless as the dead, and uncovered the wound, and found the blood coming out of the wound to be very small.
Based on the context and the similarity of the language to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a possible translation:
Sure, let's try translating that line by line:
And now I say that in the treatment of epilepsy, there is no fear.
Chapter XLIV
About the treatment of an abscess that occurs in the groin area externally, which is called a hernia of the groin.
This type of abscess named "hernia of the groin" is quite large according to the size of the body and is very common in women.
And it occurs in two ways, for it can be either natural or accidental.
And the natural type is not difficult to cure.
And the accidental type occurs in two ways: one is similar to large knots, and the other is similar to an abscess formed by the knotting of an artery, and in that case there is fear. And it should not be presumed that it should be cut except in cases where it is small. And you should examine it and inquire about it with the patient, and if you find that it resembles large knots and is not connected to any of the veins, then you should cut it like a knot, and extract it with water that contains the peel of pear or burdock; but if it is otherwise, then investigate its entire nature, and afterwards heal the place with the appropriate healing water until it is healed. ️
It seems that you are referring to a specific text that you would like me to translate line by line into English. However, the text provided is not clear or complete enough for me to provide an accurate translation. If you can provide the full text or clarify what "Capitol .xlv." refers to, I would be happy to help with the translation.
It appears that there is a typo in your request. The phrase "De seccio de las specias de nodes" does not seem to be in the language you mentioned (similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French). If you meant to write something else or if this is indeed part of a medieval medical treatise, please provide more context or clarify the text so that I can assist you better.
Based on the provided sentence and the context of a medieval medical treatise, here's a possible translation into English:
And it is important that I explain the difference between a knot and an exit wound if there is any doubt.
Therefore, I say that in an exit wound there is heat and fever and violent pain until the boil of the excess fluid is settled; and when putrefaction is complete, at that point the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But in a knot there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and I tell you about that certain lion which is in its own bag.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a head and is made thus as a vessel, whether large or small, and there are two types: either they are fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are various, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you come to the treatment of a knot, you examine it and inquire about its beginning with an instrument called a probe, as will be explained in the following chapter.
And this is the way to investigate an abscess and all knots, that you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the abscess that you find, and you will rotate the aforementioned with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the core. ︎
And then you should adjust your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the pus and observe what remains in its place.
And if the discharge is forgotten, regardless of its color, then you should cut it open with a shallow incision, as has been mentioned for other abscesses.
And if there is no discharge from the pus, then you should know that it is fat.
And dry it with a cautery shaped like a cross in this manner: as you have been taught, and suspend that with a hook, and carefully peel off the skin from all sides, and if possible, keep the bladder or sack on it, and remove that corruption with the probe.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to remove that corruption, and many times it happens like this, and then you should extract it slowly until nothing remains.
Because if any part of it remains, too little or too much, the probe will return again as needed.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders and strengthen the wound, and place a hot cautery on it where the abscess was, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large need, then you sew up both lips and treat it with what is necessary.
But if the vein is pulsatile, or non-pulsatile, then you cut and fill the site with powdered vitriol, leaving it for two days or three until the wound subsides and the boil of the blood calms; then return to incise what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the shapes of the instruments necessary for section and perforation.
The shapes of the instruments are as follows: they are of three types - some are large, others are medium-sized, and others are small.
The shape of the large instrument is this:
The shape of the small instrument is as follows:
They are made of iron, with handles rounded at the ends, so that they fit well into the incisions.
And these are the shapes of the probes, which are named albred, and one of them is called bered.
They come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
The translation of "La forma de experient gran, forma de lu:" is:
The form of experienced doctor, his form is:
The form of experienced few, his form is:
So that they may be for those growths and eruptions and fistulas and boils, because among those are of the bones and other causes.
And thus made redondas, grosses, leons, likewise as large needles with which the saddles are sewn, and they are made of brass, or iron, or silver, and the best ones are when they are made of brass.
And the experienced ones make them with black plumage, which they are careful to ensure that through these openings the fistulas in whose cavity they reflect, they are reflected with their lightness into those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, because some of them are long, and others medium-sized, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of the experienced great lead:
The form of the experienced medium-sized lead:
The form of the experienced small lead:
The forms of the hooks are of many kinds, for some are simple, which have only one curve, and there are three kinds: large, few and medium-sized.
And from them they make unguents, and from three species [of plants].
And of those from which unguents are made there are two kinds, and from three species [of plants].
And of them there are three kinds, and they are made from three species [of plants].
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple unguent, its form:
The form of the large unguent has two shapes: The form of the medium-sized unguent has two shapes. The form of the small unguent has two shapes.
The large unguent has three shapes.
The medium-sized unguent has three shapes.
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and shaved, and they are of three types, for there are large, medium, and small ones.
Form of large scalpel:
Form of the larger scalpel:
Form of small scalpel:
The ends of these with which the section is made are sharp and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way that there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient may be healed and find some relief from the heat produced by the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of scalpels, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of silver and resemble a beam with which almonds are scooped.
And on the other end is a pointed tip hidden under a spatula, and along that run the divisions inside and out, when you want it to, as you can see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden among the aforementioned for the purpose of piercing abscesses and are not perceived by patients, come in three types: large, medium, and small. This translates to "And these are the forms of those." The phrase "aquestas so las formas" indicates that what follows will describe or list various forms, shapes, or types.
This translates to "The forms of fistulas through which the flow of blood is cut off, and there are three types: large, medium, and small; their forms:" The text discusses different types or sizes of fistulas (abnormal passages or communications between organs or vessels) that interrupt the flow of blood, categorizing them into three sizes: large, medium, and small.
This translates to "They are made of ram's horn, round with some length, and they should be subtle." The text describes the materials and shape of these fistulas: They are created from a ram's horn, have a rounded shape with some length, and are designed to be delicate or fine.
This translates to "And it is necessary that these types of fistulas be large, medium, and small, so that through them the flow of blood can be swiftly cut off in case of necessity, especially when other remedies are not available at first." The text emphasizes the importance of having different sizes of fistulas ready for use, as they can quickly address the need to stop bleeding, particularly in emergency situations where other treatments may not be immediately accessible.
This translates to "However, do not use these to stop bleeding in every part of the body; use them only in fleshy areas, such as in the thighs and hips, and in the arms' fleshy parts, and in the breasts and belly and knees, and similarly in other fleshy areas." The text cautions against using these fistulas indiscriminately across all body parts, recommending their use only on soft or fleshy tissues like those found in the thighs, hips, arms, breasts, abdomen, and knees.
"And sometimes these instruments are made in other small shapes, similar to scissors for physicians, according to this form; through which blood is cut when it is done by phlebotomy, or a necessary incision of the vein or artery.
"And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
"Chapter XLVII
"On the care of male breasts, which resemble those of women.
"Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to the complement of sleep when they begin to be thin, and then the breasts also swell and resemble the breasts of women, and are often called 'gynecomastia'.
"And for the person who has this, it is necessary to cut with a lunar section in this manner, from line B to line G, and then remove all the fatness, and then fill the wound with medicinal ointment, and then suture the two lips of the wound, and care for it until it is healed.
"But if the breast hangs down and is softened due to its size as it should be in women, then it should be cut into two halves above, with two lunar-shaped sections, each of which should be contained within the other at the end of each, until the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form from line B to line G. And then remove the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer as we have said about suturing and powders, whatever is necessary for the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not accomplish the cutting that is necessary due to the restlessness of the patient and the flow of blood, then fill the wound with a cloth soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it has dissolved the flesh, and then treat the area that has been healed.
Chapter 48.
About the puncturing of abscesses that form under the nipple.
These abscesses that form under the nipple are of the species of scrofula, hard, and contain a pus that is sac-like.
And of these [abscesses], there are some that contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old cloth and leave it there for another day.
Then the cloth should be removed and treated with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of the nodes or of the scrofula, then you should incise it in the same way as we said in the section on scrofula equally.
If the wound is extensive enough to cause putrefaction, then administer a cautery on it as we have mentioned before.
Chapter .49.
On the incision of abscesses caused by an arrow or a vein.
When an arrow is broken and the tendon above it is consolidated, then many abscesses may occur. And the signs by which it is known whether inflammation and abscess are caused by artery or vein: for when abscess occurs from an arrow, it is long extended in the body; and when you probe the abscess with these things mentioned, you will feel stridor in it.
And that which is caused by a vein appears as a round swelling on the surface of the body.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those below the armpits, in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great, therefore it is necessary to avoid its treatment with iron, and that which is in the extremities or at the head should be avoided.
But on that which is caused by inflammation of the orifice of the arrow, make an incision in the tendon along its length; and then widen the incision with a hook towards the arrow, and deliver from the tunics until it is uncovered.
And then I placed a needle on that [spot] and made it penetrate into the other side, and I secured the bow with a double thread in two places, — which caused me to show you an extraction of two bowstrings that are present in the temples.
And then I punctured the location that is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood comes out, and thus the abscess is dissolved.
And then I administered a cure that produced pus until the ligaments fall off; and then I treated it with suitable ointments until it heals.
And if the abscess is caused by a cut vein, then you should have something that can catch the pus from the abscess with your hand, and then insert the needle where you had placed your hand, and make it penetrate; and on that [needle] there should be a double thread until you extract it from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a good ligature as I have told you in the grape ligature, with two parts and two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread may be extracted, then insert the thread with that needle all around the abscess where the first insertion of the needle was, and secure the threads in four places.
Based on the provided context and pattern, here's a possible translation of the sentence:
Based on the context provided and the similarity to Romance languages, here's my translation of the sentence:
Chapter 1 concerning the abscess which occurs due to a twist of nerves.
Similarly, when an abscess occurs in the artery or vein, and likewise, an abscess can occur in the nerves due to their impact or excessive labor, and similarly.
And it is most commonly found in the areas of the ankles or heel, or any place where the joints are poorly positioned.
And this is a severe abscess, and it resembles the color of the other parts of the body, and it is in its most serious condition without fever, and when it is tightly constricted with forcefulness, the patient feels a similar numbness.
And it is not an abscess in the beginning of the body, and for this reason it is left hanging, and it is poorly positioned on every side and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, for those that are in the joints, it is not necessary to be clamped with iron, because it will quickly cause constriction.
But if it is in the head or forehead, leave it hanging with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then take that one with the scissors and cut it off carefully.
Based on the given text and the pattern of translation you provided earlier, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
Chapter II
On the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area of the navel or belly button.
It is found in many men observed in the bellies of these people and in other parts of their bodies, which are called fungus because they resemble mushrooms; the cause is subtle, and its head is large; and now the lips of these are swollen, and it is one of those that is small, and it is one of those that is greatly magnified.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two things which were more like mushrooms, and there was no difference between those white ones, of subtle cause.
And now the lips of these were turned inside out and split open, and moisture ran from it constantly.
Therefore, I incised those and found in one the weight of eighteen ounces, and in the other the weight of six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is to consider whether the patient is moist and if the color of the abscess is white and moist, then the cause is subtle; in that case, you should incise it with a lancet, and there should be cauters in your presence, because often very much pus needs to be expelled from it, and if blood comes out, cauterize that. riet
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And then properly insert into the stricture of the lead thread; therefore, do not stop strengthening the large lead inside it until it is severed and falls out on its own without effort.
But if it is of great size, then there is some cause for fear and worry, especially in the case where it is in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you sever only half of it, and then cauterize that part so that it does not return.
And then care for him until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to cut that which is of dark color, has little feeling, and is long-lasting, for that is also cancerous.
And I will come with the recollection of crab near it.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of swelling at the navel.
Swelling at the navel is caused by various things; either by hernias in the abdomen, from which fat or intestines come out just as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as mentioned earlier, or by trapped wind.
"However, if it is due to a rupture of the intestine and the release of its contents, then the color of the abscess will resemble that of the body; there will be no pain, and it will appear in different places. "But if it is due to the exiting of the intestine, then the situation regarding what we have mentioned will be even more different and hidden when you press on it, and it will return; and it will be very light with it, and a great deal of bathing and hard work is required.
"But if it is due to moisture, then it will be light and not hidden when you press with your hand, nor will it be constricted, nor will it be hard.
"And if it is due to blood, then the abscess will appear with these signs: turning black.
"But if it is due to rotten flesh, then the abscess will be heavy, large, and hard, and it will form like a mass depending on its quantity.
"But if it is due to gas or flatulence, then touching it will feel light.
"And the operation on it is that you should consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or from a vein, or from gas; then you must refrain from treating it, because in that case there is fear and danger as has been taught to you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses due to arterial or venous bleeding.
Here's the translation of your provided sentence:
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
And if you have found the swelling, then take it with a hook; and incise its excesses.
But if it is against your archery or vein, then go around that area, and return to your operation. Take two needles and put into them two strong threads, and insert two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross. Make these penetrate; and then strengthen the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area open until the flesh can extend and fall on its own; or incise it when it is softened and emptied, and then treat it with water from the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to nothing but flesh or moisture, then it is necessary that you remove the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or moisture that you find in it, and then treat it with water that strengthens and consolidates the area.
Chapter .53
On the treatment of cancer.
As we have said in the division, on the type of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, and that iron is avoided in its treatment to prevent ulceration; and we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb and the precautions for treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cancer of the breast or groin and its resemblance to other members, especially when it begins small.
But when it is old and large, it is not worth approaching it, because I cannot heal anyone of that, nor have I seen any other who has achieved this.
And the operation on it is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and let the patient fast and purge with black bile several times, and then bleed him, if there is a clear accumulation found.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation suitable for the operation, and then make an incision where it is necessary; and then scrape off all around with a good scalpel until there is not even a trace of it left. Let the blood run out, and do not cut it off lightly, and press on the places, and cleanse away all the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument with which you can among the instruments.
But if there is resistance to thick blood due to an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then heal it with the other remedy until it is healed.
Chapter IV
On the treatment of dropsy (a condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of fluid in the body).
We have already mentioned, in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water and the signs of each type, as well as their treatment with medicine.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of altithias, and it should not be approached with iron for the species of tympanites nor for the species of hydropsy, because this is fatal.
And when you have treated this species of dropsy tympanites with medicine and your treatment does not work, then consider that if the patient has already developed debility, or is suffering from another form of dropsy, such as pleurisy or ascites, then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see that the patient is of great strength and suffers from nothing but dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the manner of his operation is this: you lift the patient between your hands, and then you press his abdomen with your hand, removing the water from beneath the navel, and then you take a thorny spatula in this manner:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And now consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, because then you should perform a section below the navel by three digits on the right side, near the pubis.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then your section should be on the left side of the navel by three digits.
And if the origin of it is due to the spleen, then your section should be on the left side.
And it is not necessary for your section to be on the side where the patient wants it, lest the superfluities run to that place freely.
Then perforate the entire length of the intestine with your instrument, and then enter that section, and raise your hand with a spatula between the intestine and the spleen, and you extract that; and if the amount is one fingernail or more.
Then perforate the spleen until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of water. Then extract that and insert an instrument shaped like this: and it is similar to a fine silver needle; it is made of silver or iron or bronze. At the lowest part of it is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side. The tip of it is sharpened like a pen nib, as you see:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here is my attempt at translating the sentence:
And then you extract the instrument, and you return the water that causes it to be retained immediately by the chain that draws out what is on the cup of which I have instructed you to pierce in that manner.
And then you repeat the procedure on another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small amount of water each time, and do this for several days in succession, being careful to avoid making an error until only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat it with burial in hot sand, and cover it with a cloth in a bath, and let it sit in the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until it is healed.
And you should cauterize the stomach, and the spleen and the liver close to the site of water extraction, as I have described earlier in this text.
Chapter 50.
On the treatment of children born with unpierced places of urination.
Sometimes one of the children comes out of the mother's womb and the opening of his bladder is not pierced (or it is too narrow or not in its proper place).
"Therefore, it is necessary to pierce with a very fine needle as soon as it appears.
"And then place a thin lead wire in the hole and tie it off, leaving it in for three days or four.
"And when the patient wants to urinate, remove the lead wire and allow them to urinate; then replace the wire afterward.
"And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine passing over the area will not heal this wound.
"However, if the opening is narrow, it should be treated with a lead wire as we have said, for several days until it enlarges.
"But those in which the opening is not in the correct place should be left alone, because in these cases, the opening that has formed prevents urination into the bladder until it is lifted with the hand to direct the flow above; and it is not a matter of generation, because the semen cannot reach the mother according to nature, and this is a very serious condition.
"The manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the glans of his penis with your left hand, pulling firmly. Then incise the tip of the glans at the base of the foreskin with a sharp needle, as if making an incision to remove a feather, or whatever you cannot cut off any part, so that the middle part resembles the glans and that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful in your operation to control blood flow, for this often happens; and stop the bleeding with what you can, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
About the ailment that occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis, and about the corruption, darkness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This ailment often occurs in the penis and is known as phimosis, which is an excess of skin.
And one type is malignant, while the other is benign.
In the case of the benign type, you should suspend it with fine thread and cut it until it is completely removed; then place a piece of linen soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and afterwards, treat it with diachylon ointment until it heals.
And if the ailment is malignant, of a dark color, then you should administer a hot iron cautery near its edge and root.
However, if the ailment is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the ailment is inside the foreskin while the other part is outside, then you should remove the part of the ailment that is inside at first until it is healed; and then you can treat what is outside, because when you treat both parts together with the foreskin, it is not guaranteed that it will not be cut.
Here's the translation of the given text:
And immediately treat that person with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then administer a lunar cautery in this manner:
because the healing cautery works in two ways at once, namely on blood flow and on the wound when it is infected.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed at that time, then you must insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the case of adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy and who are not required to be circumcised; when it occurs due to a wound or abscess), you should carefully peel away with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely released.
And if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should peel away some part of the head of the penis and foreskin with a spatula, because the foreskin, being thin, can be easily punctured due to its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a sharp instrument that has already been washed in cold water to prevent it from sticking again.
And then it should be treated with six styptic substances until it is healed and solidified.
Chapter 57.
On the cleaning of infants and on the care for those who experience problems after circumcision.
Circumcision is not a cure for sexual desire, like other diseases: but since it is our operation and our will, and those who are circumcised are usually infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best practice and an easier way to preserve their health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not call it "circumcision" in any of their books, because they do not use this term in their laws. The reason for this is that we have acquired this knowledge through experience, which is why I have found that the majority of practitioners and barbers perform circumcision and cleaning with a razor and torches; they also use bandages with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and found no better way of cleaning with scissors and bandaging with thread after cleaning with the nail, because many times the skin is cut too deep, as the skin of the foreskin has two layers, and the deeper layer remains, which can easily lead to further incision and certain pain. And with the cleansing, which is done using a pumice stone and is sharp, the kind that shoemakers use, the incision at the tip of the male member is not secure, because it easily enters into its opening.
But in the operation with a nail, it is easy to slip and spoil your work. And the cord of the child is naturally short, and many times it is seen in such a way that there is no need for cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, the experience has discovered to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, so that the sharpness on top is as the sharpness below; and thus as you press your hand in proportion to the two sharpnesses, and cut accordingly in one time; and it is done with compression of the thread in a figure containing the cord of the member from all sides, with which no error is made at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child sit up if he is one of those who understands a little, so that you do not do anything except tie the thread in his member as much as necessary, and leave him until the next day.
And then do all that is possible for the patient to regain their consciousness. Then place the person between your hands steadily and calmly, making sure they are not frightened; hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
Then insert your hand into the child's anus and blow into it, pulling out the contents until the head of the penis is visible. Then clean him of any residue that has accumulated there due to his constipation.
The form of scissors for modification is as follows:
They should be long and not pointed on one side, while the other should be sharp. The length of the two points should be equal to the length of two handles.
However, the mistake in modification is that if you quickly remove the entire internal string or only a part of it, you must make an incision.
Therefore, you should extend that for one hour with your nail before the incision site and cut it according to its length equally.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with tweezers and cut it.
But if three days have passed and it remains swollen under the skin, then leave it until the abscess softens, and gently scrape it off, and cut it according to how you have prepared.
And beware of the head of the vein, for it will not be there.
Therefore, treat it with something that solidifies the wound using the powders we have recommended in the powder treatment section.
And if it has been cut too much and you follow the above instructions, this will not hurt you.
And care for him with water until he is healed.
Capital LVIII.
About the cure of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone or congealed blood, or from pus or a polyp, and it resembles those of water that we have said about the ways of cure in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with the water that we have said, and the cause is strong on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction from him with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be of silver and finely honed, similar to a quill pen with the thinness of a long ray, about one and a half palms long, at the end of which there should be a fine tube.
The method for the expulsion of urine through this is to take the double-layered cloth and tie it tightly around the end of the patient's penis with wool or cotton; then insert the ends of the cloth into the slit below the glans, and cut away any excess material from the cloth using scissors. However, insert the cloth into the catheter forcefully and then lengthen the glans with a border and egg white.
Make the patient sit on the saddle, and enclose his bladder and penis with moistened linens, olive oil, and vinegar.
Then gently insert the catheter until it reaches the end of the penis; then fold the penis over the navel; then insert the catheter into it; then push it in until it reaches the bladder. If this is done correctly, the patient should feel an urgent need to urinate, and if not, it means that the meat [urethra] through which it passes has a tortuous path.
Then gradually loosen the cloth with the wool little by little, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then remove it and continue this treatment with the urinary catheter until the bladder is fully emptied and the patient finds relief.
It looks like you missed providing the full text for the translation. However, based on the format you provided earlier, I can help you translate a medical treatise line by line into English. Please provide the full text of "Capitol .lix." and any following sentences or paragraphs so that I can assist you accurately.
About the quality of enema for the bladder using clamps and similar instruments that are appropriate for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or frozen blood, or if it is severely burned, and you want to distill water and medicine into it, then use an instrument called a clampcedra. This is its form:
until its end is closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, as you see.
At the beginning there is a hollow place, into which the water to be emptied is placed, and it should be according to the amount of what needs to be expelled, without addition, until when for some reason it is drawn out from the humidities, then it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, with water it is drawn out, and when it is expelled long, just as clampcedra does with which naphtha is poured into naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to expel humidity from the bladder, insert the tip of the clampcedra into the humidity, and draw with it the water that has been placed in the aforementioned parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
And next, insert the extramitat of clapcedra into the bladder according to what we have recommended in the surgery; and then wipe away the humidity with water that you use to wipe, because that humidity quickly reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it.
And the shape of the subtle cautery with which the bladder is cauterized is as follows.
And it should be made of silver or brass, the tip of which resembles a small feather, and then insert it delicately inside.
And then take the bladder of a pig and place in it the humidity that you wish to cauterize in the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two [sticks] with double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And then insert the tip of the cautery into the bladder.
And then press your hand firmly against the bladder with the humidity, until the patient feels that this humidity has already reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and pierce it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes so that they are sewn together; and then tighten the circle as tightly as possible, because you will place in it water from the humors, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that part with the instrument and do it similarly as you have done with the bladder, and press with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
**Chapter 60**
**On the Extraction of Stones.**
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, as well as the signs of the latter.
And we have mentioned the stone in which one should perform an operation with the hand, and incision.
And the stone formed specifically in the bladder is that which is placed in the bladder.
And I will now explain it with clear exposure and brevity.
Therefore, I say that the stone formed in the bladder mainly affects children; and among its signs is that the urine exiting from the bladder resembles water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis frequently, and often he passes stones, and quickly it is discovered; and with this, one can find out.
And the healing of children from this [condition] is easier until they reach fourteen years; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. Here's a translation for the given text:
And about that for which the stone is larger and the cure is easier; if it's small, it's the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of this condition, it is necessary at the beginning to cleanse the patient with a clyster that extracts all the fissure that is in their intestines; because sometimes this fissure prevents the passing of the stone due to its inquisition.
And then the patient should be taken by their feet and placed head downwards so that the stone may descend to the mouth of the bladder, or exit from its place sometimes.
And then make that cut between your prepared hands, and let the patient's hands be under his hips, so that the bladder may be completely inclined towards the exit below.
And now look for it, and take all of it out.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then quickly cut over it.
And if you do not get it all out with your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil the index finger of your left hand, whether the patient is a child or the middle finger if he is a young man, and insert it into his anus. And place the stone where it falls below your finger. And turn that little by little into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on that with your finger, and expel it to the outside parts at the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to extend the testicles outwards with their right hand, and with their other hand pull down the cord that is below the testicles, in the place where the incision is made.
Then introduce a spatula, this being its form: And cut into it what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle place, but before the left side of the hip; and let the incision be on that stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the outside incision may be wide and the inside narrow according to how much of the stone is possible, and not more, because when you press with your finger which is in the anus, the stone should fall out without difficulty.
And know that there is some stone with an angle and edges, making its extraction difficult for this reason.
And of that stone, it resembles a seed or grain, and is round, making its extraction easy.
Therefore, if it has angles and edges, insert it into the fissure.
And if it is not so shaped, then you must engineer something on top of it, or strengthen it with a decent tool, the tip of which should be like a file with which you can scrape over the stone without causing it to fragment; or insert a subtle curved instrument under it.
But if you cannot do so, then widen the opening slightly. And if you see a flow of blood, immediately cut it off with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at first you place your hand on the mouth of the bladder and cut into it; and then push out a small amount; and do the same if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to cut into it with a large incision, because one of two things will happen to the patient: either they will die or they will develop continuous dripping of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
Based on the context and similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloes and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. Then place a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or oil and warm water, over it, to ensure the abscess is softened.
Then turn the patient onto their side, onto the healthy shoulder, and do not unbind them until the third day.
And when you have unbound them, wash the area with water and some oil, and then treat it with diaphanous ointment and diabolical ointment until it is healed.
But if an abscess forms in the wound, which is hard and corrosive, and it appears as if the blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urination (and this is known by the appearance of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, because if it remains, it will provoke the bladder to rot and cause putrefaction of both the bladder and the patient.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply an ointment made from every type of spice, using what is appropriate for them for the cure until they are healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you lift both cushions and adjust the medicines that are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and it is in the meat of the bladder, and it has been implanted there, then urine excretion is prohibited. Therefore, cure that with water which I recommend before you reach dryness, because excessive treatments with this method are accused of causing dryness; and I have experimented with this, and it is that you take an iron awl of the following type:
With a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in a handle.
Then take a thread and tie the bladder with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the bladder, easily perforating until the awl reaches that stone. And turn the awl with your hand in that stone little by little, and you will make the perforation of it until you have it penetrate through the other side; for the urine is soon released.
And then press your hand on that which is rough around the stone's exit from the bladder, because it is sharp and will be expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
If this cure is not suitable for you due to some reason that prevents it, then take a stone and place another stone on top of it. Then cut into the stone with an axe between two stones. And then extract that (the object or substance). Then remove the bandage and cleanse the coagulated blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage the stone below or above, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder. When the stone is removed, the cord returns to its place and covers the wound.
And for this reason, it is necessary when you take the stone from above, that you raise the cord to the parts above, or return to your compliment, and the wound is covered in this way as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if one sees a stone in any of them, then its cure is difficult and it is forbidden by many methods.
One reason is that the woman is very weak.
This is a challenging text because it appears to blend elements from different Romance languages and Latin. Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence line by line:
Here's the translation for the given text:
The fourth is that the location of the section on a woman's foot is distant from the stone's location, which requires preliminary sectioning, and in this there is fear.
But if necessity compels you to it, then it is necessary that you take a woman who is very skillful, and such is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that woman, then seek one who is skilled and subtle, or present a midwife well-versed in the ways of women, or a woman who has been initiated into this art.
Therefore, present her and command her to do everything you instruct her to do, from the search for the stone at the beginning; which is why she should check if the woman is a virgin, in which case she should insert her finger into her vagina and seek the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, guide her finger until it touches the stone, then command her to press down on it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and seek the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and press it firmly with good pressure.
Based on the provided pattern, here's the translation for the first source sentence:
Sure, here's my attempt at translating the sentence:
And the incision should be small at first; then introduce the probe into that incision, and if you feel the stone, then widen the incision according to the size of the stone you know will come out from there.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, others are smooth and rough, long and round, and with ridges.
Therefore, you know how many types there are of it, so that you can indicate what you want to do about it.
And if you see blood flow, apply powdered vitriol to the area and leave it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And make sure you have with you the instruments mentioned for the removal of stones in men, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
And if you see blood flow and know that the bleeding is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and press it firmly with a cloth or bandage, and do not move; leave the stone alone and do not extract it, for in this way the patient will die quickly. And then heal the wound.
So when the sharpness of the blood has passed after some days, and the place becomes calm, then you return to your operation until the stone is forgotten.
Chapter 62.
On section for hernia.
A hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white bag which is under the testicles containing the testes, and it is called a scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper skin which nature has prepared for him in the testicular region until another testicle is created; and this is the cord of the testicle between the white bag which we have said, and this is not a hernia but an atrophy.
And the cause of this hernia is weakness which happens to the testicles, because this material flows into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has various colors, for its color is either inclined towards yellow or red, or reddish, or it is black and muddy, or it is white and watery, and this is what usually happens.
And the signs by which one can know that this accumulation of water is in the white bag which we have said are these: for if it is in the white bag, then the swelling is round, inclining a little towards length, just like an egg shape, and the testicle appears, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the proper fat layer, then the abscess will be round with a head and therefore it is considered another egg.
And if the humidity is between the testicles and the white thread (a possible reference to a medical term for a specific structure), then it is necessary to leave the treatment alone/not intervene.
And when you want to know the color of the humidity, then examine the color of the humidity in the abscess with a lancet; and according to what appears on the trace of the lancet, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary that we command the patient to be bloodlet if possible for you, and frequently bleed him.
And then he should lie on his back on some slightly elevated surface, and leave under him clean cloths.
And then sit on the left side of him, and command the assistant to be on his right side, who should extend his arm to one of two sides towards the scrotum and the navel of the abdomen.
And then take a wide spatula and cut through the middle of the scrotum along its length up to near the penis.
And let the section be made straight and equally distant from the line that runs along the groin until it reaches the white cord.
And scrape that away, and observe, and be careful not to scratch it; and your scraping with which you scrape should be done until it is suspended by the finest and most subtle part of the scraping, according to what is possible for you.
And then puncture the cord filled with water with a wide puncture, and extract all the water.
And then separate the lips of the section with a hook, and extend the cord to its ends above; and do not touch the string that runs along the groin, and cut the cord in such a way as is possible for you. And cut it entirely or in pieces, and especially its fine end, because if you do not carefully scrutinize the incision of it, it is not certain that the water will not return.
But if the cord protrudes from its string at the time of your operation, then when you have completed the section of the cord, return it within, and then join the two lips of the groin's string with sutures, and then treat it as the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the ovary corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary to cut the vessels that are on the ligaments, and extract the ovary, and afterward treat it with what we have said.
But if the water is added in two parts at once, then know that there are two hernias. Therefore, cut that part just as you have done with the other one; and if it seems to be one operation, then do it.
Then you cleanse the blood and insert wool soaked in oil or scented oil into the incisions. And place another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil outside, and spread it over two blankets and the stomach area. Place some cloths on top, bind them securely with a bandage like this:
Then take two cloths and soak them with wool in this manner; make the ends with which you will press with cotton or wet wool, and attach them securely to the front of the pants, and one end should go from the buttocks between the legs, and the second should go to the groin area. Place two ends under two cushions and two other ends on two bolsters, and all the binding should be adjusted in the front of the pants.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with iron; and it is that you take a subtle knife-like cautery and inscribe with it the cord of the testicles, and it is ignited as we have prescribed until the white thread containing the water is revealed. Then you take a cautery of this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
Then perforate with that thread and heat until all the moisture is driven out.
Then extract the thread with tweezers, and scrape with tweezers, and scrape with a heated subtle cautery; and inscribe that as much as possible until you have eradicated all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and more lasting against blood flow, and better than an operation with cutting.
But if an abscess appears at the time of cutting or during cauterization, or there is blood flow, then you must treat whatever adversity occurs accordingly, with the treatment that is appropriate for it as specified.
But if the patient is weak and does not expect to survive a second operation due to its horribleness, then administer perforation as I recommend this; and it is when you are certain, by what we have said about the signs, that that hernia is watery.
Sure, here's the translation of that sentence:
And it should be an open, wide channel so that all the water flows through.
And then place a cloth over the area and tie it, leaving an opening for the remaining water to flow out. And then care for that (wound) until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the flow of water at that time, you should puncture it: and this is not done except because the white layer of skin in the opening of the wound causes resistance and prevents the release of water, so you must insert into the wound a pen or instrument with which water is extracted from drops, the form of which has been described; or attach to the opening of the wound a small tube.
And know that the water will return, and it should be watched closely for four or six months; and when it returns, then it should be punctured in the same manner, because the patient will thus spend their days (in this condition).
Chapter LXIII.
On the incision for a flesh-based hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is great risk of damage to important structures; therefore, I have seen the better outcome when it is left and the patient is saved by that means.
And I remember the operation regarding that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses occur in the bodies of those whose humors are disordered and this happens for various reasons: either due to acute sharp excess, which is diffused into the humors, or due to injury.
And its color depends on the color of the body part, and if pain is not found in it, then it is a serious abscess.
And if it is hard and light, it is called lithic abscess, the color of which is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is formed by blockage of the blood vessels, and by inflammation of these in such a way that the memory of it is already perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But what is caused by inflammation of the blood vessels can be recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the vein is not dispersed in any way due to pressure with your fingers.
And it is possible that incision can be made over this type and over other fleshy parts; and it is that you cut the skin of the humors, and then stretch out the egg white above, and extract that from the white bag, and deliver the suspensory ligaments of the vessels, and tie them off, and cut the suspensory ligaments after you have delivered everything from all parts of the egg white.
If the egg is already with those meats solidified, then it is necessary that you extract the egg and bury it.
And if there is an adhesion between the intestine or between that which is between the intestines, then it is necessary that you remove all that adhesion and bury it with a round incision.
But if it is a tumor at the place of the adhesion which is behind, then you should cut out all that is of it and extract the egg as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with another treatment until it heals.
Chapter LXIV
About the treatment of a hernia that is due to intestinal wind.
Wind is an inflammation enveloped by some similar wrapping to a bud with softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult exercise and walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this disease, one should be careful of what precedes it as a reminder.
However, we must say that the operation should be done in the following way, as the first ones did.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on a raised chair; then lower the suspenders of the testicles downwards; and then take the rope of the genitals with your said fingers, placing them against the penis; and let another assistant hold those, and extend them with great force.
And then make an incision with a sharp blade through the right side of the vessel until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape from all sides as we have said in the extraction of arrows that are in the temples.
And then insert a needle with a double thread into them, and tie the first one at the beginning of where the injury occurred, and tie it again at the end of them. And then make a straight incision through the middle of them according to the length of the body, and extract whatever is accumulated from the foul and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you wish to promote healing, so that the vessels are healed, because one of two genitals is not bad for this.
Here is a translation of the given sentence into English:
I don't see any text after "Capitol .lxv." Would you like me to help with something else or provide more context?
Of the care of intestinal hernias.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a cut that extends over the abdomen from the sides of the navel, so that some of the intestines exit through that opening.
And this rupture occurs either from the cut or from a swelling on it, and these two types occur for various reasons: from a blow, from a fall, from loud noise, from sudden lifting of something heavy, or from similar causes.
And the sign of this is that when it occurs from an extension of the cut, it happens gradually over a long period and not suddenly, because the cut presses on the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it occurs from a cut in the skin, because at first it causes sudden and intense pain; and there is an apparent lump below the navel, different from the one mentioned before, which is due to the intestine coming out and its body being divided outside the skin.  (Note: "deforo" means "outside" or "beyond," so "deforo del ciphac" translates to "outside the skin.")
And sometimes the intestine is pushed out along with the cloth, and this type of hernia is called an inguinoscrotal hernia.
And sometimes it is made with air, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, which is very harmful to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this disease with iron, there is fear, because it should be avoided to cut into it.
And the manner of operating on this is to command the patient to return the intestine with their hand into the depths of its cavity, if it obeys its return, and then turn them over onto their side between your hands, and lift up their legs.
Then stop the cord which is the spermatic cord above, and incise the spermatic cord completely along its length; then place in the two lips of the section hooks according to how you need to open the section with them.
And if, according to the quantity that is possible for you, from that opening the intestine can be pushed out.
And then remove that scrotal sac which is below the cord of the testicles, until the white hard cyst is exposed from each side.
Then insert your finger into what is the testicle, between the white scrotum that is below the cord of the egg, and between the second scrotum, and dissolve with that adhesion that is in the part behind the egg.
Then with your left hand, hold the cord of the testicles at the outer parts, and with this, extend the white scrotum upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the scrotum to the section part; and command the assistant to stretch the egg upwards, and you dissolve the adhesion behind with a complete solution.
And search with your fingers to ensure there is no intestine wrapped in the hard white scrotum. But if you find any of it, then peel it off towards the belly below.
And then cut into the section below the cord of the testicles, so that blood and pus may flow out, as we have recommended in what we have said.
And then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and administer the bandage that we have recommended (and sometimes the white gauze is cauterized, which we said near the cutting of the vessel to prevent bleeding, because many times this happens) and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the discharge is delayed, then dip in hot water and place it on top until it falls off as we said.
And then treat the wound with another treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI
Of Windy Hernia
In this type of hernia, it has not been seen that anyone was bold enough to treat it with iron.
And the first [surgeons] said that it should be done in the same way as we have described for the hernia with pus; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that side with ease of access; and then cauterize in the middle place around the abscess with hot water until the vessels fall.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII
Of the dislocation that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the joints as we have said, and it protrudes from the site.
And do not attribute any cause of the intestines to the intestines themselves; and if they do, it is little; and it returns in all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with that, it becomes a fixed fissure in the intestine until the intestine descends into the intestine; and this happens due to the extension of the intestine which is in the joints as we have said, the cause of which is because the intestine is stretched, and then it softens and the site becomes swollen and protrudes. ›
And the treatment of him is with a cautery as described earlier in his narrative.
And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: the patient should lie on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the broken apostemes above with a section by the width according to the quantity of three times.
And then strengthen the white cloth that is under the neck until it is discovered.
Then take the reed and place it on the prominent part of the cloth, and press that against the stomach's belly button.
Then sew together the two prominent spots on the end of the reed cloth, using stitching to join one to the other.
Then remove the end of the reed and do not include any part of the cloth, nor extend the hole, nor for any other reason as I will tell you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat that wound as you would with the treatment of wounds, and when you have stitched the threads, clean it and heal the wound until it is healed; because the cloth is tightened and does not fit the prominence of the rupture.
A cautery is better in this place, for it is closer to health.
I don't have access to any text or data beyond what you've provided. Could you please provide the specific medieval medical treatise text that you would like me to help with?
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Many times the cord of the testicles in some men is softened by this because the flesh between them is softened, and it is feared for him.
Therefore, it is necessary for the person who is treating him to make the patient lie according to his side, and cut off all the softened cord above the natural cord; then close the two lips with stitches.
And if you wish, cauterize in the beginning the excess of the softened cord with three or four burnings and a strong stitching.
Then cut between the stitches; then treat with other remedies until he is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter LXIX
On Castration
Know that castration in our law is forbidden; however, it has come to my attention for certain reasons which I will recall here in this book; and the mention of it is necessary only for two reasons: one reason is so that this is known by the physician when he is asked about it, so that he knows how to treat the person to whom it happens; and another reason is that we have often needed castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as mules, oxen, pigs, and similarly with animals.
And thus I say that castration is performed in two ways: either by tearing or by cutting through the skin.
But in the method that is done by tearing, the procedure is as follows: we should make the beast cease in hot water until its testicles are softened and lengthened and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the beast and press its spermatic cord with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligaments, and make an incision on each testicle with one cut until you have processed both testicles.
Then incise them further so that each is peeled. And do not leave any of the fat on them, except for the fine one that is over the vessels.  />  />
And this method of castration is better when done by tearing because tearing pulls out all the cause of the testicles so that the beast desires less.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70
About the care of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when a scrotum appears between the two testicles, which looks like a woman's vulva with pubic hair.
And sometimes that one passes urine from the space between the testicles.
But in women, it is of one kind: and that is that the woman's vulva is like two men's testicles, a little smaller at the outer opening, similar to men's foreskin and with two testicles.
And the treatment consists of three types: of two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you cut off those fused flesh until the pressure of that one is removed, and then treat them with the treatment for other diseases.
And in the second type of men where there is urination from the space between the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for him.
Chapter 21
About lumps and prominent flesh due to causes of women.
A small, light lump is caused by natural causes until it becomes inflamed and is made with care; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to the point that it spreads like in men and reaches to the penis during intercourse. ‌‌
Based on the context provided and the similarities with Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And do not delay in closing it, especially in the area of the anus, to prevent bleeding.
And then treat that area with treatments for wounds until it is healed.
However, flesh born is the flesh that remains in the horror of the mother until it fills that space, and it exits from the parts outside according to its appearance (and for this reason some call it "tailed illness"). Therefore, we must close it as we close lint, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72
Of the treatment of arthritis.
Arthritis is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or it is very narrow. And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and this is caused either by poorly matched flesh or by a subtle or thick tissue.
And it is formed either in the area of the mother, or in the sides of it, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it. It prevents intercourse and pregnancy and childbirth, and greatly prevents menstruation.
And the recognition of that is done by observing the navel. If the swelling is visible, then proceed; but if not, then you should search for it with your words or with the king's speech.
But if the swelling is caused by an abscess that is subtle and near the two lips, then you should cut and open it up.
And you place your fingers on both lips, and then place the index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, with her legs spread wide, and then push the two lips apart forcefully until that subtle abscess is broken open and the swelling is released.
And then take some wool, soak it in oil and place it over the area, and bandage it with a man's shirt for the day to prevent the wound from closing up.
But if the abscess is large and thick, then you should cut it open with a lancet or with a leaf of myrtle.
But if the swelling is due to a wound, then suspend it with a hook and cut it open.
And you should have with you the medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as alum, dragon's blood, and torches, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound is not lightly healed.
And keep it there for several days and apply some dry cloth.
And then heal it with the other healing method of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes this happens at birth with other flesh, and then you must proceed according to this manner. But if this is due to cancerous abscesses, then do not treat the cancerous abscess in the mother in any way.
Chapter 73
Of the care for hemorrhoids, and of the red bump that occurs in women's vagina.
Hemorrhoids are considered to be the mouths of many veins, through which blood flows continuously; and when they are old hemorrhoids, they are called piles.
And I have already said in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say that some receive treatment and others do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and piles, when they are in the uterus and do not appear to the touch, then do not treat them in any way.
"But those that are in the birth canal and upon which one feels pressure, those are the ones that are healed.
"And it is necessary that you place the woman in more cold and then extend her with the scissors or with rough cloth, and cut those with the razors.
"Then sprinkle on those the blood flow from one of the powdered cuts without anesthesia, such as chickpea flour and similar ones.
"Then wrap her feet in cloth for an hour, then place her in cold water.
"And if the bleeding persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, and similar things.
"Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar and make a paste with water over his back.
"And if the blood is coagulated, it is good; and if not, make two cupping glasses stick to the breasts without scarification.
"Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or in pomegranate juice, or in rosemary juice with white vinegar and make it stick to the place; then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
"And heal the one who is inside so that he may be made well.
Chapter .74
"Chapter 74: About the perforation of the womb, which happens in pregnant women.
"Many types of abscesses occur in pregnant women, such as cancerous and lapidary abscesses, ulcers, carbuncles, herpetic blisters, fistulas, hemorrhoids, gouty abscesses, tetters, and other kinds of abscesses. "And I have already mentioned these illnesses and the types of those and their signs, and their cures in the division.
"And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise about the abscess which comes in pregnant women when it is among the abscesses which collect pus, and if you want to know in what manner its operation is done with iron.
"Therefore, you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with throbbing and fever, and if it sometimes turns red and if it swells on that area, then do not cut with perforation, and heal it with what helps to speed up maturation until the acuteness of the episodes ceases.
This text appears to be describing a medical procedure involving a woman. Here's a line-by-line translation:
And immediately after, the midwife should follow from behind and to the right side of the patient, and with the instrument used to open the mother's orifice, whose shape will be discussed shortly.
And when you want to administer this instrument, insert it into the woman's birth canal, and make sure that only as much of the instrument enters her as is necessary for the delivery. But if the instrument is larger than the woman's birth canal, then you should place cloths on the surface of the birth canal to prevent the entire instrument from entering the birth canal.
And you should place the tip of the instrument on the left side and above, so that the person administering it holds the instrument and turns the tip until the mother's orifice is opened.
And when the delivery appears, and it is touched with the hand and it is soft and wet, then you should dry that place with a broad spatula.
And when the afterbirth is expelled, then you should place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some hemostatic properties on the wound, and put a compress on it in the birth canal.
The text you provided is in a language that resembles a mix of Latin and romance languages like Italian, Spanish, and French. Let's translate it line by line into English:
And it should be cured within approximately two days with an ointment that is suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother and the wound are washed together so that it is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which lily or long-leafed aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep within the mother tissue, then you must be forbidden from treating it with iron, but rather use what we have said in the section on water cures.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how to treat pregnant women when the fetus is turned sideways, according to an unnatural figure.
It is necessary for the midwife to know the natural figure of childbirth from the beginning by its signs, and this is that when you see a woman expelling at the lower parts and desiring to smell the air, and over this she is relieved because of what is on her, and hastens the exit of the fetus, then you should know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and it is the exit of the baby head first, and secondly either hanging or suspended from the navel. 👉 Translation by me
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress the belly of the patient so that the embryo descends gently, because when they descend onto their head, give them a second dose and cleanse them of those superfluities with a good purgative.
But when this happens in an unnatural and unacceptable way, because when the embryo comes out of its feet and the body of the patient is turned upside down over its head and feet, or one hand to the foot, or the head and hand to the belly, it turns easily onto its neck, and the figures of it are unrecognizable.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing you every figure of these [signs], and what spirit is in them, so that it may be indicated by this and may have been the case with this [patient].
When the child comes out onto its head naturally, and that is violent on the woman, and it is difficult for her to give birth, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then do this remedy: let women hold her, and evaporate her womb with a hot drink of fenugreek and moist oils.
And then insert the menstrual cup between the labia minora and majora, or prick it with your fingernail until the moisture inside comes out. And press on the woman's belly until she expels the fetus.
But if it does not come out, then the woman should be anointed with a mixture of black pepper and fenugreek seeds with oil.
Then order her to be pressed and make her sneeze with a strong mixture, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, so that the fetus will soon be expelled.
And if the two hands of the fetus have already come out at the beginning, then you should gently push them back in little by little. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a board and lift her feet up, and then shake the board against the ground; and hold the woman so that she does not fall because of the shaking.
And if the hands are not turned back and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the corpse of the fetus, or tie its body to its hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly, because it will soon be expelled.
"When the baby comes out onto its feet, then you should gently pull it in, and then turn the baby, and then push it in, and then take one of its feet and carefully extend it little by little.
"But when it has come out into the hips, then you command it to push, and make it cough with conditions, because it will be born if God wills.
"And if it is not born with what we have described, then you return the baby little by little until you place it according to the natural figure, because it will be born then with a lighter birth.
"And if it is not helped with all that we have described, then take of mallow and dissolved gum, and crush everything together in the mortar well, and then anoint with water the woman's womb, as low as her belly. "And then have her sit in tepid water until she reaches the hypochondriac region.
"And when you see that the parts have left him and are softened, then do fumigation with myrtle under him. And when you have performed sub-fumigation on him for an hour, then make him sit on a stool, and then make him sneeze and open his mouth, and hold his jaw, and apply light pressure to the lower part of his stomach, because this will cause immediate vomiting.
It seems that translation has been mixed with original text. However, let's proceed with translating the given source sentence into English: Certainly! Here's the translation of the given text into English:
And if they cannot walk, then make them lie down on the bed, and shake their limbs vigorously, and then administer liniments which I have recommended for mucilage.
And if the childbirth has come, then make that woman sit on a chair, and then study over the reduction of the hand, and enclose the infant according to natural shape, and make the woman sneeze, and command her to hold the infant within until it is birthed.
Immediately after the birth, spread out the child's hands and place his face towards his mother's back. Carefully, let the midwife hold the child’s hand and then gently turn him over, ensuring that he does so with ease.
And when it is and as soon as it has been wrapped, then place on its head what we have recommended of oil and of mucilage.
Then command her to nurse the child little by little, and when you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and command her to be inclined towards the right side, and then command her to be held tightly; and make her sneeze with conditions (or: in order to). Based on the context and similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of "Exitus foetus praeparati super latus":
When the patient is seized by horror from the mother according to this manner, consider, and then you should incise the second skin with your fingernail until it is evacuated of moisture.
And if the child is suspended by the face or neck, then you should incise that of the navel, so that it is not retained and dies.
Then you should push the child back into the parts inside until you place that second one in its proper place, and order the woman to hold some warm compresses, and the water will come out with slight pressure, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four, but this is strange and rare; but there are five causes of their birth, and not six.
And count them, whether they are multiplied, one second skin, and they are separated by nothing, distinguish these between the ligaments in the navel of each of those, and sometimes they come out just like a child through natural, slight pressure, and sometimes they come out through unbelievable pressure as we have said.
And if there are some difficulties during childbirth and it comes to what we mentioned about the unnatural shapes, then you treat them in this way as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and performs this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and she adapts according to every shape that is prepared by nature, leading to health.
The remembrance of what forms within the womb from embryos and then aborts.
Sometimes formations in the mother may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or even ten, and I have verified that a woman aborted and gave birth to six, and another to ten all formed, and this was caused by the measurement of the glorious sages.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife because she quickly understands this similar appearance and therefore performs it as needed.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not yet expelled, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of sound health and does not suffer from any of the conditions by which a loss of her is feared.
Then it is necessary for the woman to be placed on her left side, with her head inclined downward and her hips raised.
And the midwife should hold or tie down one of her legs on the left side to prevent the body from spreading during the delivery of the child.
Then you should moisten the mother's mouth with oils, honey, and mixtures of althea, fenugreek, and flaxseed oil.
Then the midwife should anoint her hands with those oils and mixtures, then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then carefully feel around for where the fingertips can grasp the child.
In these cases: then consider if the child is ready to come out headfirst. If so, place your fingers under its chin, or on the neck, or in the mouth, or on the palate, or under the chin, or on the breastbone, or near the ribs, or below the hypochondria.
However, if the child is coming out feet first, then place your fingers in the groin or between the ribs.
And it is necessary that you hold the fingers with your right hand and place the curvature of them in that place which is between the aforementioned fingers of the left hand, then gently insert your hand until the fingers reach one of those places we have mentioned, until it reaches the "boyda.
And then place and leave in the area of the patient another cushion or a third one if necessary, so that it is held equally and not extended as much according to its true nature alone.
And let it be moved in all directions, so that the exit of it is alleviated as it is done with a tooth when its extraction is required.
And it is necessary in them that the extension be softened; and if any part of them is retained, then the midwife should anoint those parts with oil and insert her fingers and move about that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the baby is stuck, then replace the cushions in the place where it is more forward; and do this until all of the baby is delivered.
But if the hand is protruding before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its stiffness, then a cloth should be wrapped around that; and immediately pull it out until all of it is delivered, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And so you must do with the other hand and both feet.
Here's the translation for the given sentence:
E semblantment fassa si·l fet es de gran cap per natura:
"And if the head is swollen and constricted, you must cut the hyoid bone so that the moisture in the feet can be released.
"But if it is not complicated and does not obey swelling, then you should incise the head as soon as possible.
"And if the sides of the abdomen are swollen or the patient is dropsical (retaining fluids), then you must pierce it until the moisture within drains out.
"But if the foot is on its feet (upright), then its attraction (gravity) is light and its direction towards the mother's mouth (uterus) is also light.
"But if the abdomen and feet are constricted, then you must extract that (moisture) with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the abdomen and feet until the water within them runs out.
"But if the other members (limbs) are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth (vagina) is open, then she should insert her hand into the mother's womb, and search for the head with that, and pull it towards the mentioned parts, into the mother's mouth, and immediately insert one or two fingers into the baby, and pull it with those.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted by an abscess that occurs in the body, then it should not be pierced immediately; instead, it is first necessary to administer a purgative with moist and greasy substances. And administer plasters; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the abscess is on the side of the ribcage, then if possible, it should be lanced; and the remedy mentioned for a living abscess should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces, and removed.
And it is necessary that no cause remains within the second skin (i.e., the dermis).
And when you have completed all your work, then administer the remedy that we have mentioned for the care of abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if there is a flow of blood, then apply astringent waters and administer the other remedy.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and then on top of that another fetus was found, and then the other fetus was also dead. It seems like an abscess has formed in his belly for a long time; it has swollen to the point where it burst open, and pus started to flow out.
I was called to his care and treated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied to him some plasters of strong attraction, and an object came out of him, and after a few days another object came out; and I was very surprised, since there are no bones in the belly.
And then I realized that they were the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I investigated the wound, and extracted from her many bones, as she had been pregnant for a long time, and some pus came out of it.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather because in this there is science and help for what the doctor does by hand to administer a cure.
Of the shapes of the instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
The shape of the hook with which the mother is opened:
This is the shape of the dilator with which the lips are cut, and in this cutting there should be two hooks at the ends of its two feet. "However, this virtue requires that it be more subtle than narrow, and it should be made either of hemp or of the wood of box trees.
"And the width of each stick should be two thumbs and the edge of each also two thumbs; the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle of two sticks there are two supports of the same wood, which are already fixed, whose length is half a palm plus a little more, and the width of each is approximately two thumbs, or a little more.
"And these two supports should be inserted into the opening of the vessel so that it is open with them when you rotate the two aforementioned rods.
"Form another similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
"It should be made of hemp or boxwood sticks according to the likeness of forceps. "However, at the end of it there are two supports as you see, and the length of those supports is about one palm, and the width of each is two thumbs.
"And when you want to open the vessel with those, then you should make the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down, opening that which is between her thighs. And then you open your hand with the instruments as you would with scissors, according to the desired amount of precision for the mouth of the wound until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of vertigo which the ancients called:
The shape of the force with which the fetus is pushed out.
The shape of the assistance with which the large head is contained
And it resembles forceps, which have teeth at the end, as sometimes, and in some cases it is made long like forceps according to this shape, as sometimes, which has teeth like saw teeth with which it cuts and contains. Shape of slight assistance:
The shape of a hook having a spine
The shape of a hook with two spines
The shape of a spatula with two ends, with which the head is cut off.
The shape of two wide spatulas
All these instruments are practiced, and the more species of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier it will be for their operation and the more useful they will be for men because of their number.
And of those instruments, you must always be prepared, because their necessity is not excusable.
About the removal of the secondine (a type of bandage or compress).
When the secondine is retained, you must cause the patient to sneeze by using a stimulant or strong odor, and place your hand over their mouth and nose. If this causes it to come out, that's good.
And if not, then you take a cloth and puncture a hole in it, and place inside it herbs that burn the mouth of the mother, such as calament, rue, anise, chamomile, Arabian scillas, cassia wood, and santolina. All of these herbs or some of them should be soaked in water in the cloth, and place that over the fire.
Then insert a reed into the mouth of the mother, and keep it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the mother.
Then cause her to sneeze as we have said, and the secondine will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment is not successful and the secondine does not come out, then you should command the midwife to insert her left hand in sesame oil or in mugwort ointment, and introduce it into the vagina, searching for the secondine with it. When you have found it, then take hold of it and draw it out little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then insert your hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the secondine, extract it little by little, gently, so that the mother does not suffer from a violent extraction. Before it is necessary that the right and left ribs be moved with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recommended the cure with suction and with a medicine made from the oil of herbs.
But if it is not cured with all the causes that we have recommended, then be careful not to perform on her again in succession of extraction, but rather let what comes out of her go into the mother's mouth, and immediately treat that with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for that will cause it to dry up within a few days and will dissolve and be forgotten.
But when it dries up, it raises a bad odor to the head and stomach, which harms the patient; at that time, it is necessary to administer fumigations and appropriate remedies for this.
But some of the ancients have already tried fumigation with narcissus and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated must be the retention of menstruation and the second trimester:
Based on the context of medieval medical treatises, "Sia fayta de veyre o de eram" likely refers to a surgical procedure involving either glass (veyre) or silver (eram). Here's a line-by-line translation:
And let the thin end of [the instrument] be placed in the bowl and the wide end over the fire, and let the smoke tube be placed over the coals of the fire.
And hold that until that smoke tube is consumed and then insert another one.
Of the treatment of an unperforated child's anus.
Many children are born and their anuses are not pierced, which is a subtle and serious matter. Therefore, it is fitting for the midwife to pierce that skin with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spoon, being careful not to touch the intestines.
And then place over that wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it might be blocked, then place a catheter in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And if the anus is blocked due to the healing of a wound or abscess; then that healing should be cut open, and then it should be treated with the water that we have mentioned for treatment and for lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that occur below. ︎
This is a fascinating exercise in medieval medical translation! Based on the patterns and context clues, let's break down the sentence:
And it is a fistula or ulcer.
And when that swelling is old and runs with white watery humidity or fine pus, some of these fistulas can penetrate in certain cases.
And those penetrations are known by what comes out of them in the form of discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from these discharges, and it is often worms that come out of them.
And some of those fistulas sometimes penetrate into the bladder and into the urethra, and sometimes they enter the joint of the hip and into the thigh bone.
And this is how a penetrating fistula into the anus is known from a non-penetrating one: you put your finger inside the anus, and insert a thin probe of iron or silver into the fistula when there is no discharge.
But if there is discharge in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all or nothing comes out of the hole in the form of discharge, worms, or flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed to the treatment.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or the opening of the penis, its meaning is the discharge of urine from that area and the prohibition to approach the place with medicine until it is healed.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the circumference, then its sign is that the point enters here if it is not turned towards the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that from it there is always pus; and that no medicine works there, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all those fistulas that penetrate there is no complete cure, and the treatment of them is laborious and vain work of foolish doctors on whom they are based.
But in those that do not penetrate and are not old, healing with iron is hoped for, as I will tell you, and this which I have already proven.
And let the patient lie between your hands on his back, and raise his legs up to his knees, so that his hips are inclined towards his belly; and then carefully introduce a probe of lead or iron into the fistula until you know the place where the point enters.
"And if that pain affects the patient's neck, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger into their neck.
"And if you feel in your finger the tendon already clearly exposed and penetrating, or if you feel something between your finger and that siphac or flesh, then you can be certain that it has penetrated; and at this point do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
"However, some people say that in some men, it can be healed late.
"And the treatment by which it is hoped to help him is that you light a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously stated, and insert that heated iron into the fistula until it reaches around the neck; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshly parts that resemble a quill have been completely sealed.
"And then wrap that with clean cloths until all those sealed flesh parts are dry, and then treat it with medicines that promote the growth and strengthening of the flesh. If it heals, good; if not, then it will not heal at any time through any other treatment.
Let's translate this sentence line by line:
And then clean those fistulated (i.e., abscessed) flesh that resembles the quill of a bird, and let none of them burst.
But if blood flow occurs between you and your operation when you enter those flesh, then it is best that it be cauterized with a light instrument of pus, either with fire or with an acute medicine. For fire cautery has two good qualities: it adjusts the flesh well, and it absorbs and dries out the humidity (of the blood).
Then wrap that [wound] with cloths or clean linen until the place is healed, and then treat the wound with ointments that promote healing and strengthening of the flesh.
And thus, medicines that have astringent and drying properties are used; when it is restored, it is already healed and you do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated into the depth of the anus and extends over the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
And thus, if you find the thread and there is a veil of skin or flesh between you and it, and it is close to the penetration, then do not operate on it, but trust and hope for the best.
Here's the translation of the given text: And sometimes the fistula is ended in this manner: when you introduce the probe into the fistula, and it is at the back of the anus around the surface of the body with the string and on the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing the hearts in this way:
And insert it into that probe wrapped with five threads or around them; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the edge of the anus deeply, then you extract the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus; and draw out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it there for a day or two, and when you have inserted the thread more into the flesh, tighten well so that the flesh between the two ends of the thread may enter and close.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and cured.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it penetrate, by whatever means you have prepared, so that it is much in the flesh, for it is not your task to do this lest you injure the flesh; and then do as before until it is healed.
Based on the pattern you've provided, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Haemorrhoids can occur in two ways, for either they are between the anus like charcoal, or they resemble those that are with grease of rosemary. And these can be small or large, and blood flows from them always, and it is one drop at a time, and they are outside the anus, and in its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to less moisture, from which flows citrus-colored water or a little blood with continuous movement, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit and squeeze until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should cut and suspend them with scissors or something you have available to hook them with your nail, and then you should cut off their roots.
But if scissors cannot be used due to their moisture and softness, then take those with rough cloth or a cloth or a woolen blanket, and extract them with the aforementioned things, and then cut them off and sprinkle some hot powders on them near the incision, so that they act as a cauterizing agent; or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. And then care for those with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey to expel [waste], then anoint the patient with a small pinch of castor oil, and wash them with that water which slightly facilitates expulsion when the patient is pressed.
However, if the hemorrhoids are protruding from the anus, then their cause is minor, and it is that you should take them with your nail or a thread, and push them back in, and then care for them with the aforementioned water until they are healed.
And he who has prolapse, it is necessary to administer suture in this manner: take a thread wrapped around and insert it into a needle, then pull out the hemorrhoids from both parts [of the anus], and make the needle penetrate through the middle of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the part below the needle, and tie them tightly; tighten the hemorrhoid with strong tension, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this for all [hemorrhoids], and leave one out and do not tie it, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And then place over the wound a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax; and place that over the wound, and instruct the patient to rest upon it. And then let that be within until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, cure it with unguents or with another remedy until it is healed.
And when they are old and that medicine does not work, then it is necessary for you to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the dried pus from above, which prevents their consolidation; and then cure them until they are consolidated.
Then you should remove them with abundant, strong pus until they become very clean and are exfoliated; and then cure them until they are healed.
Know that ringworm is similar to a nail, and it is not so unless it is round according to the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body, mainly in the regions under the feet and armpits, and from these places the pain should be treated.
And then it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut out, and it should be held with forceps or tweezers, and it should be extracted from its root; and then care for that.
And if you wish, cauterize the following area as prescribed in the previous chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, circular projection on the surface of the body, and many are seen in children's hands.
And its treatment is that you should spread and cut it out, or that you should strangle it with wire or hair that fits inside it. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a mole is a small, hairy or large, circular projection on the surface of the body, most commonly in the face, and when the cold finds it, it becomes like a bite from an ant, and it is made around the body.
And its treatment is that you take a quill of a goose feather or a vulture feather, and it should be strong, and place it over the mole until the circle of the quill covers all parts of it; and then turn your hand with the quill until you cut out what is around the mole, and place that on the face of the flesh, and extract the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a reed or iron probe according to this method:
The opening of the probe should be delicate and not piercing, wrapped in such a way that when it is placed on the tongue, its sensation is blunted and its rotation is controlled.
And if you wish, cauterize the insect as previously mentioned in the section on cautery of atheyl in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the forms of the instruments used to give comfort.
Sometimes comfort is given with silver, brass, or melted and hammered reeds; and sometimes these instruments are made in small and large sizes according to those to whom they are administered, because that which is administered in the care of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are raw or painful, their comforts should be small.
The form of a large and rare comfort:
The tip of the probe, at which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the bag is tied as you see here.
And the end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be very blunt and delicate, and on one side of the length there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and slightly larger.
And let there be a bag in which are placed the medications of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length should be one palm.
And let it be punctured by thin needles in such a way that it is turned inside out; and if the space between the needles is as thick as a finger,
And then insert into those needles a strong thread of raw silk which is from these threads, or wind them around; and fasten the bag with it; and when the bag is placed on it, tighten it at the top of the cross between two distinct parts with strong pressure, and then cauterize each needle with it: But the method of cauterizing is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed according to the tolerance of the patient; and be careful that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And then let the patient be placed on their back, and lift their legs upwards and place a stool or chair underneath them; and then smear the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert it into the anus gently, and then the assistant should take the bag and squeeze it with two hands and press firmly until all that is in the bag has been evacuated into the intestine; and then remove the cautery and let the patient lift their legs to the wall.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Sure, let's break down the sentence and translate it:
And if in the anus there are hemorrhoids or painful growths, then let the cautery be very fine and light, like those with which children are cauterized.
Of the treatment of the plague.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of the plague what is suitable for this book, and now I will describe the treatment of that illness with both dietary measures and medications according to its stages.
Therefore, I say that the plagues are classified according to their causes and the location where they strike.
And the causes that most often produce the plagues are as follows: incision by a stone, cut by a sword or knife, blow by a spear, club, arrow, or something similar to those causes.
But the plagues that occur in various parts of the body are as follows: a wound on the head, neck, foot, abdomen, chest, and similar ones on the limbs.
And I will describe the treatment of some wounds, so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other wounds as well.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the treatment of compound fractures will be discussed at the beginning of the third chapter.
When a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is caused by a stone or something similar, and if the wound has already cut through the skin and is severe and you fear that an abscess might form, then you must act quickly and perform a bloodletting from the cephalic vein immediately, without delay; and extract as much blood as needed according to the patient's strength, unless there is some reason against performing a bloodletting, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured part; and watch over the patient to prevent stuffiness, and from eating or drinking heavy foods.
However, if any reason prohibits bloodletting, then reduce the food intake and avoid meat or drink.
And place on the wound, if an abscess forms, cotton dipped in rose oil or wine that has been steeped with styptic herbs.
However, if an abscess is certain to form, then place on the wound, if it is recent and has not yet had its blood changed by exposure to air, a small amount of the powder that I will now recommend.
And if the air has already changed there, then place some ointment on it until it is healed.
However, if the wound is large or caused by a sword or similar object, and the lips of the wound are not close together due to loss of tissue, then close them with a suture as I will describe the method of suturing next.
But if the wound has exposed bone and sinew, and there is no retention but only a small flap of skin, then cut away that flap and treat the wound with medicines, restoring the flesh in its place, and instruct the patient to eat foods that are rich in nourishment: heads and tails of animals similar to their own, until it heals.
And if you find putrefaction in the flesh and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the rotten flesh and clean the wound, and then treat it.
However, if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows and it has not been cut by medicines, then you should look for the vessel. And if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a spatula, or ligate it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said cannot be done, then cauterize until the bleeding stops.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is light; therefore, you should powder this powder over them, because once consolidated, it will protect them from changing air.
And the manner of making this powder is as follows: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood (resin), and three parts unslaked lime; all must be ground and sieved, and with it fill the wound, and compress it tightly until it forms a crust on top, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it above with bandages and leave it, and do not uncover it until it is healed, because the medicine will not be effective if removed before healing.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And perform this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to place a compress over them and bind them tightly, and these are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered yet.
And if the air has altered them, especially in the summer, then it is not advisable to use this powder. Instead, treat them with the water we mentioned earlier, placing over them some cooked ointments, or place on them a paste made of flour from barley with water and honey until they form pus; and then treat them with the other remedy until they are healed.
If a wound results in a small bone fracture, then you should extract it with tweezers.
And I will tell you the treatment for skull fractures that are caused by an injury.
Of wounds to the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
But if the nerves or arteries of the neck have been cut, then if it is the nerves, there is no hope for them, but one should avoid their treatment with what causes violent cauterization, such as ziniar and zegi which is vitriol and similar substances that are harmful to nerves and cause contractions. And do not place any cause of heat on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is the most cold of all members.
And if it is treated with light medicines, such as being washed with warm water, sometimes infused in rose oil or non-rose oil, and bandaged when washed with warm water and the other small stones diminishing according to this manner, and moist ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer stitches or cauterize the lips of it, and afterwards treat it with powder until it heals.
But if the wound is deep or occurs in the lower part of the body, then puncture it in the most depressed area.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary to stop the bleeding.
But if the gullet or throat has already been cut and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should close the lips of the wound with a suture over the bone of the throat and do not touch it; first equalize it and reduce it to its natural shape, and then strengthen it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days; and afterwards treat it with ointments that contain astringent and stimulating ingredients until it heals. 👉 This sentence is describing a procedure for treating a deep cut or wound in the throat or neck area, while taking care not to disturb the saved veins. It involves suturing the wound, shaping and bandaging it, and then applying specific ointments to aid healing.
But if the wound has already penetrated to the bone, then you should perforate it further. And if there are fragments of bone within it, extract all that you can; and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound putrefies, and is separated, and the pain from it is relieved. 👉 This sentence describes a procedure for treating a deep wound that has reached the bone. It involves further perforating the wound to facilitate drainage and removing any accessible bone fragments. Any remaining fragments should be left in place until the wound becomes putrid, separates, and the patient's pain is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle over it the powder that has been recommended to you. But if in the wound a fistula is formed, then cure it with water of which the mention will come immediately in its chapter.
If it is a puncture by lance or knife and you know its depth, then consider more if from the wound there is a hissing sound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its blood, then place on it in the first hour powder, and do not bandage it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and poisons the patient, but place on it an attractive ointment, and dissolve this twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place on the orifice of the wound old cloth so that it draws out water that is from the humors; and make sure the patient sleeps on the wound so that water which is in it flows out.
Based on the context and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
"But if the healing of the patient is delayed and the wound remains open, then you should know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat it according to its nature.
"And if the wound is caused by a cut from a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with water that has been used for stitching if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
"But if there has already been a deep cut into the bone, and you see heavy pieces of bone, then turn the wound to try to extract those pieces, if they are separate. "But if they are not separated, then leave them inside until the wound can heal, because their removal is difficult.
"And for other wounds that occur in other parts of the body, the treatment is the same as what we have said before.
"About the wounds of the belly.
"The disorder that occurs in the belly is either great, small, or moderate.
The given text appears to be discussing a medical procedure involving the reduction of a hernia or similar issue. Here's a line-by-line translation into English:
And therefore the best solution is a diet, because in this case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, unlike the two types mentioned earlier.
And know that the closure of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two closures are common and suitable for closures of other bodily ailments.
And the other two closures are specific to other ailments, but however, they are most specific for the closure of the abdomen.
And I will explain each one to you with explanation and clarification.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and there is some cause of the intestine through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the opening as we have said, or when the intestine has swollen with cold air.
And therefore when it is so, then you should scrape it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth wet with only lukewarm water, or take with hot water, cumin, peppercorns, and cloves, so that the intestine enters until the swelling is resolved.
And sometimes this happens in cases where there is dryness or astringency, and it is better than water alone for reducing the swelling.
And when you see the swelling being reduced, then wet the intestine with water in which it is cooked with mallow and horsetail, because by this method the pain is alleviated with little effort.
But if the intestine's pain is not alleviated with this treatment, then cut a small incision with an instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when it is appropriate and does not require cutting, avoiding unnecessary weakness or exhaustion.
Regarding the instrument, look at its form:
One part of it is a sharp curve, and the other part is not sharp, with a thin tip that is not as thin as a spatula, but rather slightly blunt.
And when the wound is widened and the intestine comes out, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible on water, because that is better.
But when the incision is large and is in the lower part of the abdomen, it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place the head and feet higher than the other parts.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always keep your attention and consideration on this so that the side where the injury is located will be higher than the other.
And thus you should also administer this to both large and smaller wounds.
And in the small wounds, place what you have prepared on them, and then make sure that the person administering it is between your legs, holding the entire disruption with their hand and sealing the lips of the wound. Then uncover from that to the one who has the suture for another reason.
And this is the common method of suturing: take one needle, or count the needles according to the width of the wound; then pass the thread from the end of the disruption to the little finger, and tighten the needle, and do not put a knot in the two ends of the thread, with the two ends of the string that is under the thread of the parts inside, until you make that penetrate that part; and you have already added two ends of the thread and two ends of the string, making four rows.
Sure, let's translate the text line by line:
And the needles should be of medium size between coarseness and fineness, for fine needles cut the flesh very lightly; and coarse ones are difficult to insert into the vein, therefore they should be of medium size in both fineness and coarseness.
And it is not appropriate for the needle to be inserted into both ends of the vein too much, lest the flesh be lightly cut and the wound open before it heals.
And do not prolong the stitches so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not prick the patient during their sleep; and place over the stitches powdered substances from all sides, which contain the ends of the needles; and leave those until you know that the wound is already healed.
And these kinds of stitches with needles are most suitable for small wounds, as even in their stitching one needle or two, or around that number is sufficient.
But the second type of stitch is common: and it is that you bring together with a stitch the four ends, of the vein and two ends of the thread, all at once, with a needle on which is wound thread both fine and coarse in size.
And then when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from that same starting point from which it began, so that the thread can be pulled up from the deeper part to the wound, ensuring that the suture is as tight as if sewing cloths that are well stretched.
And place between each stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of the smallest finger.
This is the way men know [to perform] the suture.
And with this suture I sewed the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been cut with a knife, and the separation of the wound was more than one palm, and it had come out around two palms of the middle of the intestine, and the separation was in the middle of the limb; and then I returned that which the intestine had gone out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed in about fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he recovered; and then he lived for many years after that, and continues to live his life normally.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; and it happened miraculously, because I did not cure him with ointment, since it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found, but I placed cotton over the wound twice a day and washed it continuously with honey water until he was healed.
Based on the pattern you've established, here's my attempt at translating this line:
"And it is that you begin with the stitching of the wound, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
"And then, as the needle penetrates into the wound and through that ligament along its entire length, you leave the tip of the thread where you inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate from inside to outside on the other end of the suture.
"And then, when you have made that second penetration, you make another penetration in the same end of the suture from outside to inside; and leave the tip of the thread on this side, and make the needle penetrate from inside to outside at the other end.
"And make sure that with this penetration, the thread enters into the suture at its end, so that all of it penetrates inside.
"And then begin from this same side and sew it up with the end of the thread that is on the other side, and remove the needle from the wound through which you penetrated, and then return that to the wound and sew up the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the suture; and remove that from the wound that is on your side.
And do this one time and another, and do it one time near another time until you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
And the total of this manner of suturing is that you sew with a subcutaneous suture, with which you sew the skin, so that you sew the edge once from the end of the thread, and leave the other part until it is completed.
But the second type of suturing, which is properly called "Gualia," and this is about him and through him it is recommended, is that you sew in this way: with semilunar suture with which some doctors sew, so that they bring together all the divided parts to their corresponding part according to nature; and they apply the end of one to the other end, and this is done as I recommend to you.
Make sure to put the needle in the end of the thread near the part that is outside, and make it penetrate the divided part inside at that place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two ends of the thread.
And then rotate each of them, and make each one from the inside part penetrate outward to the two ends of the same, with others that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of stitching is better than common light stitching, and it is the stitching that we remembered earlier.
This is the speech of Gaul
And they will also say to you that ventral stitching is rectified with two needles, so that you insert into these a thread for each, and begin with the needle of water that you must use, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the stitching of those who cut hearts equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than for other parts of the abdomen.
But the judgment of wound treatment is the judgment of all wounds.
The reason for this is that when you obtain a recent wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestines and sew it up properly, then place over it flesh-generating powder.
Here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
If the patient feels pain or putrefaction in their intestines, because many times this happens, then cauterize that area with a black stone from a viper, especially if the putrefaction has entered the intestine and created an exit through its cavity.
And know that that which affects the large intestine is of lighter affliction than that which affects the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from any wound that falls upon it; and this is due to the great number of veins in it and their magnitude, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is the intestinal lining, and you can find it fresh, reduce it according to your skill in the same way that you reduce the intestines.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then strengthen that area with oil on the discolored spot, so that blood flow may come, because in the lining there are veins and arteries.
And then you should incise what is above that wound, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the part below the wound on him, so that the pull of his weight is relieved upon you. Afterwards, proceed with the stitching of the cloth and the release of the arm from the wound.
Recollection of wounds when they occur in the abdomen.
When a rupture occurs in the abdomen and it is small, then it is possible for some men to be healed from this, as I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound had become an old fistula, and thus from it came out intestines and air.
Then I proceeded with his treatment even though he was not cured immediately, but rather I pursued subtly that which was inside until it became healthy and the place was healed.
And I, seeing that the place had become healed, advised the patient to expect some evil in his belly; and no one suffered from this evil accident, and he lived in good health, eating and drinking, and afterwards he entered a bath and was cured by these things.
Sure, here's the line-by-line translation of your text:
And then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants, placing one near another according to the extent of the entire wound.
And then reduce it and close the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible to bind the intestine with fine thread made from the intestine of an animal attached to it, because it is more like a needle; and you should take the end of these intestinal threads, which should be very thin, and then bind the end of it with thread in a wrapping, and then insert that thread through needles and close the intestine with it, and reduce it in the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only by way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, because then it is not a simple matter, but rather a delicate operation, and there will be no complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess that becomes infected and old, turns into an ulcer, does not heal and grows continuously over time, in whatever limb it is found, universally it is called a fistula, and we call it "zuchem".
And fistula according to truth is a fleshy knot, hard and white, with which there is no pain and which has a cavity like the cavity of bird droppings; and for this reason it is named "alcus rizatz," that is, pain.
And in some men it is moist, which drips pus; and often the moisture dries up within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is moved, and it is small, and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Based on the given style and the context of a medieval medical treatise, here's my line-by-line translation attempt:
"And it is necessary that I inform you about the treatment of fistula, which is caused by surgical intervention with the hand.
"And know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines, or bladder, or to some ribs, or to some vertebrae of the spine, or to some joints formed by a similar composition as that between the hand and the foot; and there are those which affect the proximity of the main member and resemble it.
"Therefore, among these fistulas, those that are of this manner are difficult to heal and do not respond to treatment; dealing with them involves hard work and ignorance.
"And if there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that were mentioned, and you hope for and strive for its healing, and you want to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe made of iron or silver, and if the fistula goes straight, search for it with it.
"But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, for lead with its lightness can be bent and follow the twists more easily.
And if the fistula has horrifying words, it is not possible for you to interpret it with a touch.
Therefore, irrigates the anus for its own sake, because the moisture with which you irrigate it will drive out the others and run through them.
Then inquire carefully, according to the best of your ability, to determine whether it is bone or nerve that has been affected, and whether the fistula's cavity is deep or shallow, or if it is a fistula with horrifying words, and this is entirely within your power, along with your questioning and the method by which you question the patient about their illness, and you should find out the cause of the pain by applying pressure with your hand to the area, and observe any signs and accidental causes related to the abscess.
And once you have considered all these causes with true understanding, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and that is, consider whether it is an apparent fistula near the skin or far from a joint, or of nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you.
Then dry out the fistula as mentioned earlier in its treatment, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupt flesh, and anything born in the orifice of the flesh, and heal it until it is cured.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And do this with certain substances that, until the sharp medicine corrupts everything that is soft in the cavity of the fistula.
And then restore it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it heals.
But if it is not healed by this, then you should cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then inquire about it and dry it out as we have recommended, unless you find any cause related to a vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that promotes healing until it heals.
And if it does not heal and throws off pus as before, then you know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; therefore, uncover it again carefully and scrape and cleanse it with the strongest force you possess, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, that is good; and if not, then you know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which have not been reached, and therefore in this case you should not do anything but leave it alone.
And if the bone is slightly decayed or within your power to remove it, then you should remove it with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then skillfully extract all of them, and do not leave any without applying your strength.
But if any impediment arises from the moisture, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then you should incise those ligaments or flesh, if they are present, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place over the wound something that will soften the wound, and let it sit until those bones are surrounded by flesh and ligaments, and guard the wound so that it does not heal and the section that you have incised in your operation is constricted.
Furthermore, if you are afraid, place over the wound a cloth soaked in oil or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments; for when those ligaments have softened and the bones have separated from them, the extraction is made easier.
Certainly! Here is the translation of the given text into English:
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
And I recommend to you that which is discovered in a person's body, so that you may use it as an example and aid for your operation.
When a young man around the age of thirty experiences pain in his side, and from within the body moves towards the inside matter of the body until the matter reaches the side, and it is a matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then the time was extended with it due to the error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and dark matter came out of him, and his treatment was paused until the thigh was fistulized, and in him were made orifices which all poured pus and the humors of the body.
And then a multitude of physicians cured him for about two years, and there was not among them knowledgeable in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his thigh and the matter that came out of him from those orifices in great quantity; and already his body was completely swollen and his color was yellowish.
And then I inserted the probe into one of those orifices until it reached the bone.
And then I immediately examined all the openings and found that they led from every part of the thigh.
And then I cut and incised one of those openings, through which I discovered a passage in the bone. The bone was found to be corrupt, already turned to earth, blackened, and rotten; and part of the thigh through which it had penetrated into the marrow was also found to be corrupted.
And then I sawed off what had been discovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I thought that it was not in the bone itself but rather the corruption which I had cut away and sawed off, and I had already removed it.
And then I treated the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I scraped and discovered on the bone in a second examination following the first discovery, and found continuing corruption with the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to me from that corruption. And then I made every effort to heal and restore him, but he did not recover.
And then I discovered on him again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little specifically and made every effort to restore him, but he was not restored until I incised around a palm's width of him, and from that I extracted his marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it became slightly consolidated and healthy. ⟩
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation on him and section of him except for the disposition of his weakness and the lack of his tolerance and his fear of death, because he faints at all times due to excessive evacuation and bad syncope.
Therefore, he is healed by complete healing, and there is nothing left in the place of bone hardness; and the arrangement of him within his body is done well and his vital force returns; and he is returned to his normal state and does not suffer any opposition or harm while walking or for any other reason.
But if the bone is prominent in some part of the body already touched, then it is necessary that you cut according to this manner: and it is that you take a bandage and make it strong on the tip of that prominent bone, and command someone to stretch it upwards; and place that bandage of wool over the first bandage; and then tie it over the flesh which is below the bone, and extend the tip upwards so that you draw the flesh away from its natural position, and you uncover the flesh in the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not touch the flesh.
And place a stick or board under the bone properly, because when you do this, it is not permitted for the saw to cut the rotten flesh.
And it is necessary that the stitch be placed on the corrupt spot little by little, because if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear in its true form to the touch, then the stitch should be made again elsewhere.
And if the bone is not prominent and there is a continuous lesion with another, or the corruption is in the middle of the bone or in its part, then you must uncover all parts of the flesh; and place a stick underneath, and then stitch the first part where the corruption is until the suture of the other part is completed.
And let the suture be small according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint, and stitch the bone where it continues with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not reasonable but rather dangerous.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is very difficult; however, you must find out how the corruption appears to you, and cut that part away, and clean it according to whatever method is possible for you, and with each danger straightened as much as possible without causing a contrary vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws used to cut these bones must be chosen according to the position of the bones, their preparation, size, fineness, largeness, smallness, hardness, and rarity; therefore, you must prepare all kinds of instruments suitable for each operation.
And know that this operation requires you to be proficient in the type of instrument you need; since you have great study and long experience in the ways of this art, and are familiar with various diseases, you will already know what is appropriate for each tool according to each illness.
And I have listed for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will use as essentials, with which you will proceed to your practice, which you will test on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw.
Shape of a large saw.
Shape of saw. Its head should be in the shape of a star-shaped nail, and its teeth should be in the shape of an awl's teeth.
And it is not advisable that with him are rubbed the heads of the joints when they are inflamed, or the opening is very wide.
A smaller razor form.
A flat razor form
Form of a saw decently made: let it be made from the upper part of a bow and the edge of iron, with its wooden parts well-crafted like a dagger. The shape/form of it
A form of razor which has concavity
Another subtle form of razor.
A form of another razor with a curved tip
A small form resembling a stinger
Another smaller form of incisor
The shape/form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its tip is like a saw, and it is used in many places on the bones.
A form of ray which is suitable for use as a tool for piercing/boring into the bones
And its tip is triangular and sharp.
And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly we want all the causes that we have said about razors and incisors and saws.
Based on the pattern and context from the provided lines, the translation of "De inscizio extremitatz e de la serratura dels osses" into English would likely be:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And the sign of that person to whom this happens is that the member becomes black until it seems like fire has burned it, or you can approach the darkness until the darkness enters that part and spreads through the entire body; thus, beware of that.
Similarly, if the cause is corruption from some poisonous causes such as scorpionfish, viper, or weever, and likewise.
And if the corruption or puncture is at the tip of the finger, then cut off the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it does not enter into the hand.
Similarly, if it affects the hand, then cut off that part at the base of the thumb, and do not give space to the corruption so that it does not reach the upper part of the arm.
And if instead [you cut off] that one, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes and surrounds the elbow, then in that [case] is the death of the patient; and administering another cause or treatment at that point is a quantity of virtue.
Similarly, do the same with the foot when corruption affects the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints.
And if you feel pain in the side of the foot, then you should cut off the entire foot. But if the pain ascends to the shin, then you should cut off the leg at the joint of the shin.
And if the corruption has already spread to the shin, then in him there is no cure but dismissal, and let the patient go toward death.
And the way to cut off or cauterize the limb is that you place a ligature on the part below where you want to cut, and place another ligature above it; and the minister extends a ligature to the parts below, and the ministeress does the same above; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligatures until there is enough space for all the flesh to be exposed; and then it should be cut or cauterized.
And it is necessary that cloth of linen be placed on all parts so that the clean place does not touch, and let the patient have a fitting wound and cauterized abscess.
But if you cause bleeding while working, then you should cauterize the place carefully, or place on it some powders that restrain the blood; and then return to your work until it is completed.
And then bind the afflicted member with a bandage to the appropriate location and care for it until it is healed.
And I recommend to you what happened to a man in his foot, this very accident which I and you have mentioned, which is that blackness occurred in his foot with burning that was similar to the combustion of fire.
And this corruption first occurred in his said foot, which then spread throughout his entire foot.
And then the man prepared by himself a pus that he saw the cure going to the member with great violence from him who had pain and burning, and he amputated that foot at the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time this same corruption occurred in his right hand.
And then I came to him, and I tried to drain the excess with water from the medicines placed on his hand; and the excess was not drained, and it began to spread to the other hand which had begun in the right hand.
And he asked me to amputate his hand, and I did not want to do that hoping for the drainage of this excess, and more than anything I feared that the amputation of his hand would kill him, because the strength of the patient was weakened.
And since he recovered from me, he returned to his land and it was reported to me that the man prepared himself and cut off his entire hand, and he has been healed.
And I have related this story only to serve as a guide in dealing with this disease, and to be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which treatment should be carried out.
On the care of sinews and the quality of clyster administered with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged to such an extent that it collects pus, and then it breaks and perforates, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin above it is also thin like a fine cloth, and it has not yet reached final putrefaction, and it does not press on the bones or nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinew, and not a fistula.  (The text describes a condition that would now be referred to as a pilonidal sinus or cyst.)
But if the space is prolonged to such an extent that putrefaction presses on some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is that you should cut off all that skin entirely as if it were rolled up, and especially when it is thin like a cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place due to its putrefaction.
Mays si tu speras que la codena adheresca e que aquela corrupcio no aja conseguit per deriera consecucio, e en la codena ha spassitut de cara, lahoras tu cura aquel am clisteri.
And consider the armpit, and if it is large, and the arm that you have is of a fetid odor, then enema that area with Egyptian medicine, which consists of oil, vinegar, and cinnamon, mixed in equal parts and placed in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take from him the amount of water necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and enema his armpit with that mixture, strengthening his orifices, and allow the medicine to remain in him for a period of two hours.
Then extract that with a syringe; and do this for so many days until the armpit is cleansed and the odor has been removed.
And sometimes it is enema-ed with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and it is that you take the ashes of grapevines, and put them in water; and then strain that mixture and enema that area with it until you confirm that the armpit is cleansed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then enema that area with water and honey mixed with finely ground cinnamon, and also enema with vinegar and honey mixed together, for by the power of honey it cleanses and washes, and the vinegar makes the armpit adhere better, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the vinegar.
And when you have done this several times and realize that the swelling has decreased, then administer an enema to him with water that promotes the growth of flesh in him.
And take some of the ointment called diafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil and vinegar; or administer an enema to him with various medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the swelling is too narrow to receive the canula for the enema, then gradually widen it with a small iron, and place a clove of garlic wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basilicum ointment until it is sufficiently widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is too large, then narrow it by sewing together its lips, and leave as much of a gap as is necessary for the enema to enter without spilling over.
And if the orifice from which the arm has been raised is elevated above the parts, then dry it in the most hidden place of it so that the arm may descend into it, because when the arm is restricted by the swelling, flesh will be generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the wound within the environment of the bone, then prepare the member with a preparation that allows the arm to move lightly as needed and ensure that there is no retained cause in the arm.
But that which is over the orifice of the wound, which you should change at all times, so that what is draining from the arm may exit. And so you know whether what comes out of the arm is too much or too little, and whether it is digested or undigested.
And with this, consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess in it.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that was placed on the opening of the sinus has adhered, or nearly adheres, then on the second day you may detach it or on the third day, and when you detach the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if there is still some space in the sinus where the thin pus can flow out, then do not despair of its adherence, because its healing is appropriate; for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds takes a long time, and there are others in which it is done contrary to that.
And if after many days the sinus has not yet healed, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then adjust for dryness in the medicines, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their power, they should be dried as with diachylon ointment, when an excess addition of wax is placed on it.
And the treatment for this condition is to take an ointment called diaphanicon and dissolve it in rose oil, and then apply it on the affected area twice a day, and then complete the treatment with this ointment.
And if there is no diaphanicon ointment available, take myrrh, aloe, and ashes, grind them all into a powder and sprinkle it on the honey that is over the fire until it thickens. Then line [a cloth?] with this and place it on the sinus; and line the honey that has been thickened with [the cloth], and then spread it on a cloth and strengthen it [in place].
And sometimes these [remedies] are administered with long and slender aristhol, and root of celestial lily (which is the same as celestial lily), and powdered henbane seed and centaury. Use these simple or compound remedies, grind them and sift them, and sprinkle the resulting powder over the thickened honey; and use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that the corruption is in his lung, and now make an inquiry into the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you cure it with a fistulous treatment, as was said above.
This text appears to be discussing treatments for specific medical conditions involving fingers or toes. Let's break it down line by line:
Based on the text provided and using context clues from the similarities to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And so when you have that person with the condition we mentioned in the division and do not perform your care, then it is necessary for you to cut off with iron all the superfluous material remaining from the nail and then cauterize the wound immediately after that, because cautery is very beneficial in this case.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is sound, and the additions of the nail already compress the flesh inward at the divided parts, and they begin to prick and afflict that part, then it is necessary for you to place a subtle cloth under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push that up and cut off the flesh easily, and place on that which remains of the flesh some corrosive medicines until everything is removed; and afterwards cure that person with ointments until they are healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then it is necessary for you to cut out that bone and extract it, because it will not heal as long as the bone is corrupt.
And if you see that the rotting and corruption are affecting the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints according to the best memory (i.e., as close to the base as possible), and then cure that person until they are healed.
Here's the translation of the given text:
"But adjusted, which is born in the hands of some men, very light it is in flesh, and very light in bone, or very light in nail.
And some of them are born in the region of the joints, or it is the birthplace of certain people in these regions. But that one who is born in some of the said places does not become ill, and this one who is born in the joints becomes very ill.
And of those who are born fleshy, the cutting is lighter, and you should incise them with a lancet.
But that one who is born in the region of the joint has a difficult treatment; therefore, beware of the incision of him.
But in that one who is born in these regions, you must incise the skin at the beginning with a round incision to the bone, and then saw with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it inside so that it may heal.
But the consolidation that occurs among these viewed motions either by birth of the man who is born thus, or by consolidation of a wound, or by burning of fire, or by resemblance, then you must cut away this consolidation so that the motions return to their natural form.
And then place between them dressings soaked in rose oil, so that they are not easily consolidated, and separate these, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until it is consolidated as needed.
"And similarly, if consolidation (like swelling or hardening) occurs in certain parts of the hand, then you should dry out that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
This sentence seems to be about a specific type of vein issue: "About the appearance of varicose veins.
"Varicose veins are veins that are swollen and thickened with excess melancholic humors, which commonly appear in the limbs of the body. They most often occur in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers, workers, and bearers.
"Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purgative of black bile to the patient several times with a strong expellant, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
"However, the treatment for varicose veins has two methods: one is to make an incision and draw out that black blood, and the other method is to raise the vein and extract it completely.
"The incision is performed as follows: first, wrap the leg of the patient with hot water until the thick blood dissolves, which is deposited in the leg. Then strengthen the leg of the patient to the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. After that, make an incision in one, two or three places with a wide cut, and then raise the black blood from the lower part of the leg upwards and downwards until the desired amount of blood has been removed and the patient's strength is restored.
And then tie it up, and command the patient to abstain from black bile-inducing foods.
And repeat the treatment with phlebotomy when the veins are full and this is noticed by the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who raise the patient's leg, if there are hairs on it, first shave it; then place it in a bath and pour hot water over the leg until it reddens and the veins become prominent; or, if it is a strong exercise, if a bath is not available to you, until the limb is scalded.
And then dry the cord in the right of the vein by sectioning it in the length or back of it you should place the needle, or at the lowest part of it you should place the heel.
And then open the vein with scissors and strip it of all its parts until it appears sensitive, and this is what you should look for: that which turns black when asked to incline towards darkness.
And then, having evacuated [the blood], and from the vein you see that white thread, let it be a cord.
And then you place that [cord] underneath so that it is raised and separated from the vein, and suspend it with a cord of eleven spans in length.
Here's the translation of the given text:
Certainly! Let's translate the given text line by line:
And do this: extract the highest or most superior part of all sections until everything is removed; and then incise that.
And if it does not obey and cannot be extracted or elevated, then insert a double-threaded needle with a strong eyelet and ligate that, or place a ray under it and rotate your hand in all directions until it is expelled. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it breaks, it will be difficult for you to elevate that and it will come upon the patient with harm.
And once you have completely removed it, then place on the wound site wool soaked in oil and vinegar, both plain and aromatic, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the bowel is twisted and has tortuous parts that are involved in this condition, and it is not straightened as we have said, then you should make incisions all over its tortuosity and at its points of involvement, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And be careful with your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not damage it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use discretion in this.
"The shape of the wound with which life has dried up:
"It is not so thin as a sore or at the extremity of an acute state, so that it does not harm the vein; and it has a large flexibility like a lion's, because if it were subtle, it would cut the vein with its subtlety; it has in it a superfluous thickness just as we have said.
"On the extraction of the calf vein.
"This vein is found in the thighs, in hot lands such as those of Al-Andalus in Arabia and in the hot and dry lands of India with little fertility, where neither grass nor trees grow.
"And this vein is also found in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
"And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from the intestines, just like poisonous snakes and worms and scorpions and snakes that are generated between the intestines and the flesh.
"And the sign of its onset is that this vein causes a violent inflammation in the thigh, and then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the blister as if it were growing like a plant.
And then when the extremity appears from him, it is necessary that you wrap around it a lead weight which weighs between one and two pounds, and tighten it so that the lead hangs from the thigh.
And as many times as you see any cause of the parts coming out, wrap that in lead and tighten it. And if the cord is prolonged, then cut a part of it and wrap the rest; and do not cut it too deeply until it has come out, because if you cut it too deeply it will contract and enter into the flesh and cause an abscess and rottenness in the place and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently and be extracted little by little, until it has been completely removed from him and nothing remains in his body.
And this cord can issue from some men to the length of five palms and ten fingers, and I have heard that it has issued one of twenty palms.
And if it is cut during the time of its treatment, then introduce the ray into his anus and pierce it with a long hole in his body, until everything that is in the matter has been evacuated, and administer putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then treat it according to the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has large branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, and it comes to them with many orifices, and each orifice is a branch.
And therefore treat that as we have said in the division, and with what has been mentioned above.
About the cutting of worms born under the skin, which is called cattle sickness.
This sickness is named in some places cattle sickness because it often happens to cows and it's a worm that is born between the skin and flesh, which goes through the entire body ascending and descending, and it reveals its movement from member to member until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors, just like it happens with worms, snakes, earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
It is feared because of its malice, for when it goes into the body and reaches the head, and comes to the eye, then it swiftly enters it and destroys the eye, which often happens.
Therefore, when you want to cure and extract it, do not do so except when you feel its movement and appearance, and then you need to have something on top of it and something underneath it with strong pressure and constriction, and also dry on top of it, and then extract it.
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
"On the incision for the disease of the navel.
"This illness is named 'navel' in our land, and it is a pain that affects some members, often spreading from one member to another.
"And I have already seen this disease as I will describe to you. "I was called to a sick woman in a town, and after she removed her clothing, I saw a small inflammation on the vein of her arm. After about an hour, I saw this inflammation move like a worm towards this [member], but more lightly than if it were a flea, as if it were living silver when it moves from place to place.
"And then the pain went into that location and settled in the muscle, where it remained for about an hour.
"Then it traveled to another part of the body until it reached the other arm.
"Then she told me that it was turning around within her body, just as I saw; and I was greatly amazed by the change in it and its speed from member to member. "And I had seen something similar before in my own eyes, but I had never seen pain being transferred from one limb to another as quickly as this. "But I have not seen this as much in women.
"And I do not believe that this is due to anything other than the fact that women are of cold nature, and have thin bodies and open veins, and in such cases, the sense of this windiness appears.
"And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this treatment in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with closed veins.
"And when you want to treat the patient and they feel this pain, then it is not apparent on their face as we have said, then strengthen over that area and lightly and slightly press on it until that windiness is expelled, and cauterize the area.
"But if you do not see it on their face, then treat them with body purges and things that expel windiness, and strengthen them with stinking pills and with pills of serpentary and the like.
"On the removal of arrows.
"Arrows are diverse according to their types and the parts of the body into which they strike, for their diversity is that some have large heads, small ones, concave ones, blunt ones, and solid ones; and there are those with three edges, and those with tongues; and there are those with barbs.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the given text:
E therefore if these signs appear to you, then you must refrain from the treatment and removal of the arrow, unless it is urgent.
Therefore, the signs of an arrow striking the heart are that it is close to the left nipple, and when touched, it feels as if it has struck a hard object, not a soft one; the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse, black blood flows from the wound, there is coldness in the extremities, sweat appears, and fainting occurs; thus, you should know that death will follow without delay.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are that there is frothy blood coming from the wound, and the veins near the neck are swollen, and the patient's color changes, and they expel a great deal of air, and they gasp for breath.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane that is in the foot, then the pain will be close to the small ribs, and there will be a great deal of vehement pain and sighing, and not all the members of the limbs will be well.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then undigested food will come out of the wound in abundance.
Here's the translation of the sentence:
"And if the arrow hits the bladder and causes urine to flow out, and any other condition leads to external damage or discomfort in the patient, you should know that this is a fatal situation.
"But the other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and joints, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the hip, and similar parts of the body, are saved according to the greatest possibilities when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
"And I will tell you about these arrows because I have seen their effects, so that you may understand how to treat them.
"The reason is that in a man, an arrow struck him in the lacrimal duct of his eye near the root of his nose, and I removed it from the other side, leaving the gray hairs of his ear, and he was healed, with no harm coming to his eye.
"And I extracted another arrow from a judge, which had struck him in the gray of his eye, leaving only the eyelid visible, and the arrow was already hidden, so that nothing more than a small tip attached to its shaft could be obtained, and it was a large arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron lion's head on which there were no barbs.
"And since it is the Judge (or Physician), let there be no unfortunate outcome.
"And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man who had been struck in the throat. It was an Arabic arrow and it was that one with the owl feathers; and then I cut into his throat between two blood vessels, which were already submerged in his throat; and then I carefully removed it, and thus healed the Christian man.
"And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the stomach, and I thought he would die from it; but after thirty days passed without any change in his condition, I cut into the arrow and pulled it out, and he was healed, and no unfortunate outcome occurred.
"And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound healed over it, and after seven years, the arrow came out of its own accord.
"And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had lodged in her stomach, and the wound healed inside her, and she did not experience any change in her condition, and the woman suffered no damage to any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whose face an arrow had fallen and the wound was healed, but the arrow remained, and he did not feel much pain, and similar to this.
And the arrow was removed from the prince of the king who had an arrow stuck in the middle of his nose and it had already leaned slightly to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to care for him immediately after the arrow entered three days ago.
And then I found the arrow wound to be very narrow; and then I examined it with a fine probe, but did not feel anything; however, he felt a prick below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prick was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I bandaged the area with an adhesive and digestive plaster, intending that the area would be reduced so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that it could dry on it.
And no significant swelling occurred in the area indicating that the arrow had reached there; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days, and no swelling occurred; and the wound healed in the meantime, and the patient was free from pain for many days until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
It seems like you're trying to translate a medieval medical text. Here's my attempt to translate the sentence into English:
And immediately I adjusted the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to me, and I passed with this treatment for the duration of four months.
And immediately after the wound was enlarged, I managed to insert the forceps into it, and I left them there without any issue. Then I did not cease in attempting and inventing with various methods of ingenuity until one day I managed to seize it with descending forceps well made, as will be shown at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I healed that wound.
And although some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, I restored it and the wound was healed, and the patient was made entirely healthy, and I found no cause for concern in him.
And I will tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may follow this rule and indication on what I have not said, for the divisions of this art and its definitions are not comprehended by narrative nor do they comprehend those who read books.
And the wise craftsmen compare a few words; and what is present with what is absent; and they discover new operations and new instruments for the descent of foreign causes from the art when it happens.
And therefore I say that arrows are not thrown from the members in which they are placed, but according to two manners: either by attraction of the place in which it enters; or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which is thrown by the place where it entered is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is pulled out and thrown forth.
And if it does not obey the immediate extraction in the hour in which it falls, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and thus the attraction of it and its exit is relieved.
Similarly, if it is placed in bone and does not obey your extraction, then leave that one for some days and repeatedly attract and moisten it each day, until it is pulled out.
And if it does not obey your extraction after some days, then you must bore around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine awl until the place is enlarged by the arrow, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden in the body and is hidden from sensation, then inquire for it with your hands, and if you feel it, then extract it with some tools that are suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the shaft, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins here, then make an incision over the wound until it is enlarged enough that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if the ear is affected by those with which it is connected, then you should release the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and be creative about this, if you cannot on the removal of the flesh in the fracture of the ears and in their twisting until it obeys.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
If you can't perform the treatment at that moment, then leave it for some days until the affected parts can be relieved, and then try again when it is alleviated. But if there is an opposite flow of blood, then administer the treatment we mentioned in the previous chapter.
And take care not to cut into the vein, nerve, or cord, and administer oil in every way possible to help avoid the arrow; do this with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, as I have advised you and as you are instructed.
Therefore, you should act in opposition to the arrow so that the patient is in a position according to the figure as you must determine the trajectory of the arrow within him, for this is more beneficial. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
But if the arrows have been shot from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow has protruded outwards, or if the tip of the arrow is swollen by the sensation of the part sticking out above the skin, and it appears prominent; then cut on that spot; and let the incision be according to the amount in which the forceps take hold; and then draw it out, for it is done lightly at the time of extraction.
Sure, let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line:
And if not, leave it for several days, and then try again until it heals.
And if the arrow's shaft is in there, then pull it out with your hand.
However, if the shaft has broken off and you want to administer an extraction, then insert this tool into the wound. If it is blind, use a concave instrument so that it enters through the concavity of the back of the arrow and then pull it out with your hand.
However, if the arrow is barbed, then you should pull it out using a strong instrument that enters deeply into the wound, because the arrow is made easier to remove by this method.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you should cut away all the flesh in which the venom resides, if it is within your power to do so, and then treat it with an appropriate remedy.
And if the arrow hits the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and it is so close that you can touch it with your finger, and it is within your power to cut over it, then cut over it and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew up the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.
This line translates to:
"Their extremities are like the beak of a bird, made sharp as a saw when they grab onto an arrow to prevent it from escaping.
"From these are made many species of medicines, large, few, and more according to the size of the arrow and its slenderness, as well as the extent of the wound and the constriction caused.
"in such a way that, like a reed, it eases its entry into the hollow arrow and is pushed along with it.
"On bloodletting of the veins.
"The veins that are commonly used for bloodletting are 30 in number, of which there are 16 in the head. There are two pulsatile veins near the ears, called jugulars; two herbs on the temples; and two venas lacrimalis in each eye, called aspicientz; the vena metopica in the middle of the forehead; the vena dorsalis nasi at the tip of the nose; two venas jugulares at the neck; two venas labiales superioris on the upper lip; two venas labiales inferioris on the lower lip — these are known as angelic veins —; and there are two venas sublinguales under the tongue. Here is the translated text into English:
In the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of them is behind the curve of the wild boar's tendon; and the second is called the saphenous, and its location is in front of the domestic pig's leg; and the sciatic vein, and its location is in front of the wild boar's leg; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The treatment for the veins near the ears is catarrhs, migraines, scabies, and old ulcers of the head.
And the method of bleeding those [veins] is as I have told you: it is that the patient's head be shaved, and the patient's head be rubbed on the occiput in the place of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then tie the patient's neck with a bandage so that both [veins] and their locations are close to the ears in two depressed places on the head; and you search for it with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those [veins] with your finger, here is the sign.
Then you take the lancet, and it is that one which is pointed, and then you insert it under the vein in the depression until the phlebotomist reaches the bone. And then raise your hand with the vein and the cord above the separated parts, and cut the vein with an incision tool. And let the length of the incision be approximately two fingers wide, or around that; and make as much blood come out as you want.
And then strengthen with poultices and leave it alone until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of this book, the incision of those [veins] and their cauterization has been described.
But of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, the help of phlebotomy is for migraines and stubborn evil headaches, and frequent blindness, and bodies with acute superfluities overflowing to the feet.
And the way to bleed those [veins] is as I recommend to you: have the patient hold their breath until the two veins can be felt clearly by touch, and let the pulse under your finger be shown; and then you will know with certainty.
And then raise the cord above the vein on the separated parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy knife below, and lift the vein up; and cut it in the same way as you have done with the other two veins; and make the blood flow according to the amount of your need.
This sentence appears to be discussing the treatment of a patient with a specific medical condition, possibly involving a vein or blood flow issue. Let's break it down line by line:
And already the memory of them is mentioned at the beginning of this book.
And therefore the incision for bloodletting from the vein of the forehead is similar to that for the cephalic vein in cases of ancient face diseases, migraines, fevers, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the way to perform bloodletting is as I described to you earlier. The patient should hold his neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called a scoop, which looks like this:
Place the tip of the scoop on that vein and strike it gently or with another tool in the same manner, allowing the blood to flow according to the desired quantity. Then remove the scoop from the patient's skin and hold it in place until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lancet, but the lancet should not be too sharp as with other incisions, instead it should have a blunt tip, and make the incision lengthwise, because the bone is close and strong and could break if the lancet is too sharp.
Based on the context and pattern from the previous lines, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck with a bandage, and then you should perform phlebotomy on them, while standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be done according to the length of the vessel, a little at a time with small incisions, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the incision is too fine, it may break off the end of the vessel.
Then let enough blood flow out so that it is necessary for you, and place a bandage over the incisions, and bind them for one night, and then release them.
However, phlebotomy from the nasal vein is appropriate for acute fever and severe cold, and for facial disorders, migraines, and heat that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient should hold their neck and then you should take their nose with your left hand, and make a fine, long incision and place it in the middle of the bridge of the nose along its length, because the vein is not felt here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Make sure you complete your incision little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for one night, because that is quickly healed.
Certainly! Let's translate the provided text line by line into English:
And the characteristic of bloodletting from these areas is that the patient should lie down on their back with a blanket; and the practitioner should be positioned over the head of the patient, while the patient lies flat on a bench.
And then proceed with bloodletting by opening the vein with a wide and small phlebotomy knife little by little; and then extract blood according to an appropriate quantity or as many times as necessary for this purpose; and then act similarly for the other veins.
And then unwrap the bandage and bind both veins tightly to prevent the patient from bleeding too much, and leave it on until morning when the wound is healed.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the jugular vein includes treating small pustules and sores in the mouth, corrupt gums, bad ulcers and cracks, as well as bad ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
And the characteristic of bloodletting from these areas is that you should make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, and then lift up their lips and look at the two veins, one on each side of the lip; and the distinguishing feature of each is by the darkness of both, and this is more so because in their vicinity there are small black veins; and then cut each one through a transverse incision.
But if doubt remains with you, and you don't know which of them it is, then proceed to an incision of the larger one, and the most apparent one among them.
And make it look like the two veins that are on the lips above.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, it is proper to do phlebotomy on the cephalic vein for headaches, throat infections, and mouth diseases.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on them is to have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, raise their tongue, look under the tongue, and you will see two veins on each side, and the color of each tends towards blackness.
Then perform phlebotomy on each one; and be careful not to pierce too deeply with your hand during phlebotomy, because below those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those that are customary in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they place with the phlebotomy needle a mirtilat or olive tree at a subtle incline; or with a cutting phlebotomy knife, and it is called alnessil, and this is its form:
It should be used as many times as necessary, and it is suitable for opening large, full, prominent veins that contain thick, dark blood.
And this bloodletting is of less width and more subtle in its effects, and it is suitable for bleeding thin veins that contain thin, bright red blood.
However, the assistance of bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it extracts blood from those who suffer from jaundice and yellow fever, and from what affects the feet and the stomach.
It is advisable for the bloodletter, when performing this bloodletting, to be very careful and attentive, because next to it there is an artery, and if he makes a mistake in the puncture of the bloodletting, he will cut that artery and cause bleeding, so it is necessary not to bleed with a pointed bloodletting instrument before it is cut with anesthetic.
Based on the pattern you've provided, here is a possible translation of the given text:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When you see, as the bandage is strengthened, swelling in the place where you have applied the compress, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and thus avoid it.
And if you see the blood flow in phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is subtly red, then know that it is from the artery; and at that time, cut and press your finger over it for a long time; and after removing your finger, and if the blood is not severed, because many times it is not severed, then strengthen the arm and let it be.
And take care of the patient's urine, and beware of it and do not allow it for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not severed, and you see that it is necessary to use medicine for this, then you must cut the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is contracted, and the blood is severed; or take a strip of linen cloth, and make a tight bandage with it, and take one half and strengthen it over the vein's place with a stricture, with poultices until another day.
E lahoras si le sanc es abscindit, bo es; e sino, lahoras cura aquel am aquo del qual es precedit a la rememoracio del loc de las polveras abscindentz flux de sanc.
"And the abscess of his blood is difficult in many situations due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of tearing the arm.
"But the venipuncture of the dark vein is more appropriate for extracting blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and cephalic vein, as we have said.
"It is important for the phlebotomist to be cautious during the patient's phlebotomy, as there is a nerve below; and if it hits this nerve during the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will experience numbness, and it will be difficult for him to heal, and sometimes he may not recover completely. This nerve often appears in the sensation; and if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy instrument with which you are cutting with a section of alnus, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
"And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein along its length.
"The best method for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is to draw blood from the head and cure diseases of the eyes.
And it is particularly necessary in this case, if you want the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped phlebotomy tool or a myrtle-shaped one; because it is the safest of all veins, as it does not have arteries or nerves nearby.
However, it is very important to note that in some people, if the phlebotomy is not performed on the initial percussion site, then do not notice this swelling.
The first is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and with hope for the patient, as a precaution against illnesses. Phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins in the elbow: the cephalic, brachial, or basilic; it should be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, and in autumn and winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day or in the early morning, after three hours have passed since dawn.
And the phlebotomy that is administered should be done when it is convenient and necessary, whether at night or during the day, at any time.
And a child should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled except between the fourth and seventh month, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled in any manner, they should first cleanse their intestines with a leonine cluster before the bleeding, so that during the bleeding of the intestines, which are impure and harmful to the main members, the veins do not draw out excesses.
And patients who are suffering from seasickness or drunkenness should not be bled, nor those who have just recovered from illness or intoxication until that has left them, nor patients with dropsy. Moreover, bleeding should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive sexual activity, labor, fasting, vigils, and any other cause that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. 》
And then consider in subtlety of humors before this if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medications if that is possible for him.
And then enter into a bath if nothing prevents it, or exercise through some form of exercise so that the blood is thinned out.
And perform phlebotomy on him at the feet of the day, which is around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the feet of that person are protected from all bad animal accidents on that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as work and excessive fatigue and sex and their likenesses.
And for his comfort, let there be present the causes of use with which it is customary among men, with fragrance and scent and balms and their likenesses according to the quantity of possibility.
And let the person performing phlebotomy sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who needs to be bled.
Then extend your arm and rub it with your hand two or three times, the one performing phlebotomy; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it two or three times.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not equal or if it is with superfluidity, then prevent blood flow; or it is with softening, and then prevent the body from bleeding.
And as for the constriction, it is necessary that he who must be bled rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly perceptible to the touch.
And the bloodletter should anoint his bloodletting tool with a little bit of oil specifically; and then place his index finger of his left hand on that vein, just below the spot where he wants to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein protrudes a little, and the pulsation is stopped, for there are veins which when you search for them like fleeing cords, from those should be performed the bloodletting, and those are full of windiness and when the bloodletting tool is placed on it, it contracts, and the bloodletter is discovered; and the bloodletting tool does not touch the vein, and if it touches, that one is narrow.
Therefore, for this reason the bloodletter must be skilled and attentive to all these conditions.
It looks like there was an issue with displaying the text you provided for translation. However, I can try to help translate medieval medical texts if you provide a specific passage or phrase. Please share the sentence or paragraph you would like translated into English.
Here's the translation for the given passage:
And then perform phlebotomy if she desires it.
Based on the given context and the structure of the language in the provided text, here's an attempt to translate the new sentence:
"But if you see that [the patient] is already in a state of apoplexy, then do not touch them, for it will bring you no benefit; and place on them some parts of the olive oil split, for it soothes the body with blood. "And in this case, olive oil is better than any other oils.
"And similarly, apply olive oil split in all phlebotomies, with which you bleed the veins, prohibiting the body from losing blood, and make it work like a theriac, aloes, and saffron when placed on the affected area, because the blood is subtilized and becomes thin when it is thick.
"And if a large abscess is formed at the site of phlebotomy, which happens frequently and especially in those who have not been bled before this time or when only a small opening of the vein is made, then you should cauterize [the area], and place on it a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly crushed, and hold it for an hour, because it will dissolve.
"And it is advisable to do this near the end of bleeding from that vein or another vein.
"And if there remains in the area for some days any darkness or greenness, do not be concerned; and if you wish, place on it some aloe and myrrh dissolved, or some juice of mint or chamomile, or something similar.
And often when these abscesses and swellings occur, you should perform phlebotomy from the basilic vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if you find softness, you should apply pressure on it, for that swelling is bad; and therefore be careful not to press on it any cause of what we have said, because the blood will flow quickly from the artery.
And make a plaster with water that has astringent properties, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to the amount of their strength and according to the predominant color in the blood that appears.
For if the blood is black, then you should let it flow until it turns red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick, then you should let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness has been removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and has a need for bloodletting in one time, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the incisions be wide.
And in the case of one who is weak, do the opposite of that, and it is necessary to extract it in many viewings, and let the opening be narrow.
And the best practice for venipuncture in phlebotomy is to make a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safer from bleeding and nerve injury, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting according to length and width.
And in those who are prone to fainting, you should perform the phlebotomy beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in vinegar or oxymel and extract only a little blood in three or four viewings.
And if there is a chill from a cold, then before the phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup seasoned with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar ones, or in strongly scented aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs during the phlebotomy and it is due to loss of too much blood, then one should drink meat water and a strongly scented subtle syrup; and use aromatics with aloe, and anoint their feet with it.
And use other methods that we have mentioned in the section on syncope for evacuation.
And for those who wish to empty their veins and dissolve their blood according to the rules, it is necessary that the phlebotomy be for a moderate amount of evacuation, and the virtue [of the patient] must be cold; they should let the blood out little by little, which corresponds to the amount of the virtue in continuous days.
However, for those who wish to empty their veins and expel their blood according to custom, and whose body is strong, they should do this about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
However, for those who wish to draw blood from their body in the opposite direction of the inclination, it is necessary that this be done on the second or third day.
However, in a body where much blood has already been drawn and the blood is hot and causes fever, it is necessary to draw more blood all at once and in great quantity; widen the opening until syncope occurs, because you will have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand on the pulse of the patient so that death does not occur instead of syncope, for many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not advisable to release the arm and drain the blood repeatedly if the orifices of the vein are already closed and difficult to open, as applying strong pressure in this situation can cause harm.
Have the patient remain until they have been properly bled; or leave that [task] to the skill of the phlebotomist, who knows how to coagulate the blood in the vein's orifices; or place on it some powder of theriac alfarach, or of sagzenea, and press lightly until the blood has been completely expelled.
And if the vein is swollen (apostemada), then leave it alone and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.
And if there is a need for you to drain the blood again and there is no excuse [not to do so], then bleed that person in the same place or in the other arm from another vein.
And the vein called "funis of the arm" is bled in place of the cubital or basilic veins when these cannot be found or are hidden, because it is formed from those [veins].
And the method for bleeding that person is for the patient to put their hand in hot water until the vein becomes visible and appears clearly.
And then it should be tightened over that with a bandage and a narrow band; and then perform phlebotomy according to the small transverse vein, not horizontally or along the length.
And make the opening wide and perform phlebotomy with the tool you use to puncture that area on the joint of the hand, a little.
And if the flow of blood is blocked, then immerse the hand in hot water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
But if it is in the days of summer, then you are excused from immersing the hand in hot water, and instead the body's blood should be drawn into hot water in the winter months.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, for there are no pulsating veins or nerves below it.
And phlebotomy of the little finger of the right hand is appropriate for liver diseases.
And the procedure for phlebotomy is to tightly bandage the hand or hold it with your own hand, after placing it in hot water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then puncture that transverse vein, and if you miss it completely, it will not matter.
And be careful not to cut your hand with a phlebotomy needle, because beneath are the nerves of the said, which have been stripped of flesh.
And immediately immerse your hand in hot water and let the blood run into it, because if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein, and its flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary quantity, then you should place oil and salt on the vein so that it is not immediately sealed; and similarly, you must do this in every narrow passage.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen.
And do the same in his phlebotomy as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy from the saphenous vein is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and for illnesses of the shins and old ulcers on the thighs and their similar illnesses.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
Here's a translation of the given text:
And if you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, then you must be careful of the nerves that are present on the surface of the foot. Place your phlebotomy tool at an angle across the vein, as if you were going to cut it.
And may your phlebotomy be successful.
But if the flow of blood is blocked, then you should immerse the patient's foot in hot water and let the blood run out until it has been fully drained.
And if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then they should try again with the phlebotomy tool a little further up, as the area is healed; and do not fear malice, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And do the same with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise.
And for the sciatic vein, the location is as we have said, near the ankle, below the wild part.
And the benefit of his phlebotomy will be to alleviate hip pain when it is caused by excess blood.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient enters the bath, and quickly and firmly binds his waist from the hip to above the ankle in four turns with a long, thin bandage, so that it does not appear except for this.
And so when it appears, then you should perform phlebotomy on that [part of the body] according to each method that is possible and according to the transverse [vein], and it is better; or incise it by incision or dry it by drying, because the place is salty.
This sentence seems to describe a medical procedure or diagnosis related to pain in the feet. Let's break it down line by line:
And beware of the nerves, and make as much blood flow as you want.
Then release the constriction and place on the area of the phlebotomy cotton and strengthen the area, for it is lightly healed.
On cupping and the qualities of using those.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or glass, or crystal.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them with scarification and bloodletting, and the other without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cups that are applied with scarification and bloodletting are placed on fourteen parts of the body: one in which cups are placed is alnocrati, and it is the last part of the head; and the middle place between the two sides of the neck together; and cups under the chin below the jaw; and cups on both shoulders; and cups on the back of the hand; and cups on the two elbows; and cups on the two wrists; and cups on the two knees.
Certainly, here's a line-by-line translation of the provided text:
But if the necessity arises for an enema due to illness or constipation, administer it at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, in the middle of the month, and at any time it is needed.
Therefore, when any of these causes are present, and especially if it is in the middle or third of the month, then command that an enema be performed after two or three hours have passed from daylight.
"And the remedy for wind in the neck is to apply pressure to the head and what has settled in the heels; but it is better that this be an evacuation of the entire body.
"And this wound is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
"And it is not permissible to use this for someone who has a complete break or catarrh, because it causes great harm.
"And for that reason, the old should not use this, especially those whose heads are broken by illness.
"But for those who continue to use this, forgetfulness is caused; and for that reason, you should order the person applying the cupping glass to remove their hand slightly from the cup at the end, so as not to cause forgetfulness.
"But cupping on the back of the neck is in the place of phlebotomy of the black vein and the basilica: and for that reason you apply it for asthma, and for constriction of breath, and for splitting of the respiratory organ, and for coughing, and for chest congestion.
"And it is necessary that the cupping glass on the back of the neck be lifted a little, because if it is left in place, it causes weakness in the body and in the stomach.
This is an interesting text! Let's break it down:
And it is important that you instruct the wound dresser not to press too hard with their hand during the incision, so as not to cut into an artery and cause bleeding.
And for cupping, place alcohol on the chin, gums, and any sores that may be in the mouth, as if preparing for a phlebotomy on the lips.
However, the cupping that is done with two spatulas should be applied with caphatan, which is used to warm the area.
And the cupping on both sides of the nostrils should be done similarly to the phlebotomy of three veins: the basilic, jugular, and cephalic veins. This is because it attracts blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, as well as the smaller veins from other larger veins, until the attraction reaches the three main veins.
And instruct the wound dresser not to press too hard during incision, because this area is bare of flesh and leaves only nerves and arteries exposed.
And it is a type of cupping used on the buttocks and is applied to treat hemorrhoids and other ulcers in that region.
"And it is necessary to command the cupping therapist to use a large cup, and that it be made of glass, because the area requires strong drying out; and subtle and thin cups should be used for treatment, and it should be scarified with scarification.
"But cups on the thighs should be used more subtly and precisely, for they draw blood from the entire body, and thus they relieve old pains of the knees, hips, bladder, provoke menstruation, and thus alleviate bothersome discomfort; they serve as a substitute for bloodletting by two veins, arteries, and two joints.
"However, they greatly weaken the entire body and cause syncope in many men.
"And as for the substitution for bloodletting, the treatment is similar to the treatment for cupping on both thighs.
"And the quality of the cup's position is that you place the cup at first on a visible spot and then move it by drawing temperately, not prolonging the position of the cups, but rather placing them lightly and keeping them steadily, so that the humors come to the area by natural flow. And do not stop repeating this process and continuing until you see the area become red and swollen and that the redness of the blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and then consider the condition of the body.
Because that man who has thin skin and few pores, you should scarify him only once and no more, so that the area is not ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification and make it a little deeper, and always ensure suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice, because in the first incision the pathway for the thinning of the blood and its water content is opened. But in the second [incision], for the thorough examination and removal of thick blood.
And if the blood is very dark, then the third incision should be made so that it can be completely removed.
Finally, when we want to extract a little blood or very little, one incision is sufficient for us.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify with deep incisions.
And in the process of scarification, the depth should be only as deep as the corner of an eye.
And if the vein is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with gentle, open, and resolving oils. In the summer, this can be oil of aloe or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of cumin seed. In the winter, it should be oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or of hemp, and oils of similar nature.
And if the swelling is thick and harsh, then let the oil be of amaranth, or oil of balm, or oil of aloe, or oil of dill, and their likenesses.
But if the cupping practitioner has large pores and soft skin, then it is necessary that they be prohibited from using oil. And to these, the places where the cupping glasses are applied should be washed with vinegar or strong saltwater, or water of cumin, or water of violets, and things of similar nature.
And for that one whose blood is of great humidity, wash his wounds with vinegar or water mixed with myrtle and sumac, similar to those [remedies].
And for that one whose superfluidities are thick, wash his wounds with old vinegar or water of savory (which is marjoram), or decoction of dill, chamomile, and similar to these [remedies].
And it is necessary that the wound be covered before bathing; it is also necessary that [the remedy] be administered immediately after bathing for an hour or two, and it is necessary to sleep near the wound.
What should be done to regulate the blood flow before phlebotomy?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person who is bleeding or who needs phlebotomy is choleric and hot-blooded with inflammation, then it is necessary that he take cold remedies, such as acidic pomegranates, endives in vinegar, lettuce, cucumber, and syrup, and similar to these [remedies].
And let him also take foods such as boiled meats and the flesh of lean birds, and acidic foods, and similar to these [foods].
Here's my attempt to translate the given sentence:
And it is necessary that on the day of bloodletting and phlebotomy, the drink should be greater than the food.
And it is necessary that some men be given triaca alpharac or musk medicine, such as muskade or alcelita, before bloodletting or phlebotomy or shortly thereafter, so that the main members may be comforted and the blood subtilized; and they should not take that cold bath.
But the bloodlettings that are without incision should be done on the liver, and over the spleen and gout, and over the navel, in the joint areas, and the scrotum of the groin, because these members do not tolerate incision upon them.
And it is not desired for these except the attraction of blood from a member, such as placing a bloodletting cup on the breast in an illness with a flow of nosebleed; and this is used so that the thick, unrefined windiness of the member may be dissolved, such as by placing (it) on the belly and navel; because this rarifies the member and cools it and removes pain because it resolves windiness.
And it has been placed on the eyeballs when there occurs in them a cataract or inflammation, because by virtue of strong attraction it removes the cataract and eradicates the inflammation from its place.
"And similarly, when it is placed over the liver and spleen, you should release any trapped wind in those areas.
"And these ventoses are administered with suction alone; and some times they are administered with fire.
"And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of the spleen.
"And this is why the ventouse should be filled and made larger, it should be either hot water alone or water in which suitable herbs have been cooked.
"Form of ventouse administered with fire: the diameter of the opening should be two fingers wide, as we have shaped it; and the quantity of air should be half a palm; and on its side, in the circumferential area, it should be half that size, with the hole being small enough to fit an needle.
"It should be made of thin iron or copper, with wide edges, smooth, and polished, so that it does not disturb the member on which it is placed.
"And in the middle of it there should be a crossbar of iron or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
"And this ventouse should be much larger than the one we previously described; and the smaller one should be used according to the illness and the condition of the patient using it.
And the leeches for children and weakened individuals are different from those used for young adults and robust individuals.
And the method of placing this leech with fire on the member is to extend the cloth moderately over a few candles of wax and place it in the middle of the transverse rod in the center of the leech, so that the fire is lit around the part below to avoid burning the patient's body.
Then it should be placed on the patient's member, and the finger should be placed on the hole as we mentioned earlier. When you have the leeches ready, remove your finger and let the steam escape through that hole; then the leech will immediately start to dissolve.
Then light the cloth according to its method, and repeat if necessary.
However, in the case of a leech used to treat pleurisy, it is filled with water and does not have a transverse rod or hole. It is only placed on the member when it is full of water.
And this is its form: The larger this leech is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
**Capítulo 97.**
**Leeches are not applied to all members, but only to those in which it is not possible to place cupping glasses due to their small size, such as the foot and gums; or on members devoid of flesh, such as the finger and nose.**
**And the quality of using those leeches that you have found in clear, clean water.**
**And then they should be laid in clean water during the day and night until they become sluggish, ensuring there is no remaining cause in their belly; and the body should first be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then warm the patient's member until it reddens; and then place them on the patient.**
**And when they are full, remove them.**
**And if it is possible to suck out the area with a cupping glass, it is more helpful afterwards.**
**And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and cold water; and warm and compress it.**
**And if the body's blood flow is prolonged near the site of the leeches and there is sweating, then you should insert a linen cloth in warm water and place it over the area until the sweating subsides.**
Here's a translation of the given sentence:
And it is necessary, if required, to repeat bloodletting when it is possible to change those.
And if bloodletting is prohibited due to suspension, then the area should be burned with fresh blood or insert a needle into the spot until blood comes out; and afterward they should be bandaged, because those that feel any blood will immediately heal better.
And when you want them to close, sprinkle a little powdered aloe on them, or salt, or ashes, and they will heal quickly.
Thus begins the chapter of the third part: restoration. This chapter is most often necessary in the art of medicine; and it deals with the restoration of broken bones and dislocations that occur in the bones.
Oh son, know that the foolish doctors and common people boast about this chapter, as well as those who at any time do not respect the books of the ancients or read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, the method of the knowledgeable people in our land is disregarded; and I have not forgotten it at any time completely; and I have not included what follows except after a long study of the books of the ancients and reflection on their meaning, until I extracted the science from them.
And I have directed my life towards experiments and studies throughout my lifetime.
And I have already described all that my science contains and on which my experiment has passed in this chapter; since here I have abbreviated it for you others and delivered you from the occupation of length; and I have abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation; and I have shown it at the end of declaration; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by addition of declaration, just as I have done in two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
First summary and compilation regarding the essence of bone fractures, which is necessary before we begin to recall each of the diverse types of broken limbs. Therefore, let us state in the preamble of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters, the understanding of which at the beginning is necessary for the craftsmen and for those who are stationed on the truth of those; so it is with you and others like you who know or learn this noble art.
And therefore I say that when any fracture, dislocation, twisting or fall occurs, then it is necessary at the beginning to apply bloodletting or purging to that person, or all together, unless some reason prevents it, such as weakness of virtue, or if it happens to a child, or an old man in decrepitude, or if it is very hot weather, or very cold.
Sure, here is the translation of the text:
And then return the patient to their usual routine with which they are accustomed.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient be fed with nutritious foods that are thick and heavy in consistency, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, rice, cabbage, beef tripe, oxen, fresh fish, fatty and similar foods, and with this regimen a more gentle and better coagulation of the fracture is achieved.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and infirm cannot be continued and healed according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and anneals the broken bone from every side with a similar glue-like substance that adheres to it and strengthens it until it is completely healed and bound together, reaching its full strength and firmness, just as fire at first, until any cause prevents it from doing its work. 😊
And for this reason, it is necessary to place the patient's food under restraint, food that has heaviness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are varied according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture in the leg bone is different from a fracture in the skull bone; and a fracture in the foot bone is different from a fracture in the hand bone; and similarly, all other limbs differ among themselves.
And I come with a detailed description of every type of fracture, explained separately in their respective chapters.
Regarding the diversity of fractures within themselves. And the types of bone fractures are also varied within themselves; for there is a curved fracture, which occurs when stars strike it; and sometimes a fracture occurs according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shinbone and splinters, both with and without protrusion, as is done with a feather when it is prepared to be written on, and there is a fracture with bruising and disruption in the skull, and there is a small fissure fracture.
The text appears to be describing a general principle or rule in medieval medicine, particularly concerning the treatment and management of patients. Let's translate it line by line:
Sign of bone fracture. And this is how a bone fracture is recognized: it is twisted, and there is a protrusion and swelling that can be felt, as well as pain when you press on it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no visible twisting or swelling and the patient feels little pain upon your touch, then it is not a fracture.
However, it is possible that there is some twisting or a small fracture, so you should not move it with your hand and apply pressure to the entire area. Place on it medicines suitable for this moment, such as remedies that narrow by thin constriction.
And know that when the area is arched and not split in two or other damage occurs to it, such as when all parts of its companion are removed, then you must begin immediately with the straightening of it, having placed on it a poultice of warm cautery.
And if it is treated with a warm poultice, then leave it for several days until the inflammation subsides; and then bind it as tightly and cleverly as you can.
And know that the restoration and puncturing of [the patient] is easier than with bones, in which case this happens.
And then strengthen that second one so that the memory of him will come back.
But if in the bones satagy is occurring, then it is necessary to extend this broken member into two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; with your hand if the member is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and your hand.
And let your position be with which you place the broken member in its natural form, while the parts are being extended from the broken member, then ensure that you make those additions return to their place and by every means that you can apply there.
And be careful, according to your strength, that no pain or injury occurs to the patient due to your operation; and do your best to ensure that you apply one bone with its companion in their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you touch it with your hand, and if you see any other cause, correct it and make it equal according to the amount of your virtue.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as many foolish doctors do who cause an abscess to form quickly due to their operation, or cause a contraction in the member, as we have seen this happen due to the operation of their foolishness.
And the quality of the constriction in a limb is what I am describing to you, so that you know that broken limbs are varied in their smallness and largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the thigh, similar to these, then it is necessary that the wrap be of very fine cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in these there be a wrap of wide and hard cloth, because the width and hardness binds the large member with strength all around with a constriction, so that in it no spot enters.
And then you begin to place conveniently an equal number of wraps on that area of the fracture, with three or four wraps according to what the member deserves; and strengthen your hand a little with the wraps.
And then you come to that which is the highest part of the fracture site, and strengthen less so that your constriction does not equal the strength with which you have strengthened the fracture site. And then you lengthen with the wrap of the fracture site a bit, and lessen the constriction little by little, until you take from the site a large part.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And then place between the woolen cushions of the mattress or cloth a pad with which the contortion of the fracture is contained, if there is contortion in it; and if not, do not put anything on it at all.
And then place another bandage over it, and then wrap around these moderately made bandages immediately, if there is no swelling or abscess on the spot, and then place on it what can draw out the abscess and remove the swelling; leave that for a few days; and then strengthen on it the bandages.
And let the bandages be of half-peeled cane, well-formed and wisely made; or they may be of pine wood; or of palm ribs; and let the width of each bandage be according to this shape and this pattern:
However, it is necessary that the bandage placed over that fracture be somewhat thicker and wider than the other bandages, and the length of the bandage according to the size of the member, whether large or small; and then strengthen on the bandages with another bandage according to your first binding; and then tie over it with a decent string as we have said about binding, and let your binding be tighter nearer to the fracture, and the further away from the fracture, the looser the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and be made of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by some foolish doctors who use ropes instead of linen threads, this is a great error, because when the constriction should be equal.
And likewise, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them what you want, and it is not good if there is more than one finger's width between stitch and stitch.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the needles near the constriction in their places, then place some cotton or carded wool underneath to prevent damage to them.
Sometimes a fracture occurs with a wound, and there is disruption in the tendon, and I will mention that specifically in Chapter Two.
And know that not every broken limb is sutured with needles on the first day; the reason being that when the limb is large, it is not suitable to place needles upon it except after about five or seven days, according to your caution against an abscess forming.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients would restore, which are placed upon fractures and dislocations and sprains.

Based on the context provided and the similarity to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French, here's a possible translation of the given sentence:
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
In this ointment, there is no virtue of healing or removing pus, but rather it primarily relieves pain.
Another method for making an ointment that heals fractures: take leaves of wild fig and leaves of wild poppy, crush them all together and make an ointment from them.
A quick method for an ointment used for the healing of bone fractures and when you want to resolve the remaining pus: take equal parts of arnica flowers, chamomile, violet flowers, and unripe wheat grains, crush them all together, mix with wine, if the member is not cut.
But if it is cut, then prepare that with water of damp coriander or with water and use it.
Another method for a stronger resolving ointment than the previous one, when hard pus occurs during the healing of the limb: take equal parts of arnica flowers, lime seeds, marshmallow, melilot, majoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; crush them all together and mix with willow water or sweet water or wine, whichever is appropriate for the member and according to its color.
Based on the provided context, here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
Here's a line-by-line translation of the provided sentence:
Certainly! Let's break down the sentence and translate it line by line: If the location experiences intense pain, swelling, or inflammation, then you should cut or loosen it immediately and remove the dressing from it.
And take a cloth and a marine sponge soaked in warm water, and with that wash the area until the swelling ceases and the pain is relieved; then let the member rest for an hour; then place on it a woolen bandage soaked in vinegar and oil or rosemary oil, and bind it overnight to ensure that the abscess does not burst, that the inflammation of the member subsides, and that its pain is removed.
Then repeat that fine and small binding and plaster, but do not tighten it with your first constriction, and continue with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, the redness, the pain, and all the incidents have been removed from everything, and you are in need of a plaster and binding, then you should do likewise as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if no cause of those that we mentioned occurs to the member, then you should not loosen it until three days or four, five, or seven; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to what seems appropriate for the unbinding of the member, as we said, until the fracture adheres and approaches the coagulation of the flesh on that.
And then adjust in the narrowness more than in your initial narrowness, and adjust according to the thickness of the patient's food, as is remembered before.
And if you see the location of the fracture already dry and wasted more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching there; therefore, soak it with cold water completely whenever you clean it; do this for three entire days; and relieve the narrowness a little, and through this operation, let the nourishment run to the limb, and it will be healed gently.
But what the foolish restorers of a fractured limb do is to restore it again at another time when it was not restored properly in the beginning, and it is restored crookedly; this is an error according to their operation, and a great danger, and if it were done correctly, the ancients would have warned against this in their books, and they would have worked accordingly.
And I have not seen any of them do this, which is why it is more reasonable that this should not be done.
Chapter Two: On Fractures Occurring in the Head.
There are many types of fractures, and their shapes are varied, and the causes are different, because some fractures are caused by a blow from a heavy object, and this blow shatters all the bone into small pieces, which remain inside the flesh, just as one does to wood, and for this reason this type is called splintering; or the blow cuts off some part of the bone, and cuts the flesh of it but does not pass through to the other side; and this type of fracture is called clean break.
And this wound from these two fractures can be either severe or minor, and the fracture can be caused by crushing or tearing; and the cause of it is blunt force trauma or falling onto a rock, and their similarities.
And this fracture can be either penetrating, close to the skin next to the bone, or it can be in the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two fractures can be either severe or minor.
And when the fracture is in the bone, with only small cracks in the hairline, this type of fracture is called a "hairline" fracture.
And this fracture is caused by either falling or being struck with a rock, which results in a small fragment of bone entering the injured area; it occurs in the concave parts of the body, similar to what happens to earthenware pots when they are hit and shatter into pieces.
And this occurs mainly in the long bones of humans, such as children's bones.
And all these types of fractures are considered bad like stars separated from each other.  (Meaning that they are not good or favorable) And I will come back to this topic with more details in due time.
And to recognize all these types of fractures by detection on them and by examining their joints and the presence of rotting flesh on them.
And a capillary type is recognized by this: that it is exposed on the bone, and cleansed, and lined with a joint, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the accidents of the patient, and then if you see by the accidents that it signifies clearly fear, as is vomiting from anger, extension, loss of consciousness, voice abolition, syncope, acute fever, outflow of the humors and redness of them, and similar accidents in major dispositions, without doubt he will not be cured.
And if you see non-serious accidents, you hope for health; then you begin the treatment of him.
The cause of which is that if the wound came to you in the beginning as it was wounded and this is in the days of winter, then you must study the exposure of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all disposition.
And if it is in the days of summer, then you must cut to expose the bone before the seventh day, having that what is under the skin is corrupted by the panniculus, and that the accidents which we have listed occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and it is with small splinters and gravel, then you should insert the divided and crushed part, as I will tell you later.
And you should shave the patient's head where it is afflicted, and expose the bone according to custom and manner as is possible for you based on the shape of the wound, and make sure it is gentle on the patient.
And if it happens to you that you detect the bone, or a flow of blood or pus cautiously, then you should apply to it what is necessary, and that is: you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the wound rest until the pus is sedated, and be sure of the flow of the blood; and then begin with the circumcision of the bone and its removal.
And this is according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you insert the bone with an incisor of this shape: And then administer another incisor like this, slightly wider than the previous one; and this is its shape:
And then administer another incisor even wider than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have diverse names of scissors, some of which are sharper than others; and some of them are shorter than the others, and they should be at the end of sharpness in their points, and they should be made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease when striking against the scissors, so that you do not cut off the head and hurt yourself.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to bore a hole around it before you apply the scissors with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not named this way only because those [drills] do not reach the end of the bone to that which is near it, for the drill has a round tip or edge on which there is a sharp point resembling a small margin or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take many of these drills, each of which should be suitable for the thickness of each bone, until you have all the skull bones ready, with their ends sharp, and their length and width according to the thickness of this bone.
And this is the way to perform three types of trepans: The quality of perforating around the broken bone is to place the trepan on the bone and rotate it with your words until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then change the trepan to another place, and insert it in such a way that it completely traverses the thickness of the radius or environs.
And then you should cut with scissors that which is between each fracture of the bone, and make it as fine as possible on that end for lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or by some other means with suitable instruments such as tongs and fine forceps.
And it is important that you take great care that the scissors do not touch any part of the brain.
And then when you have circled and perforated the bone, and if it is continuous with the brain, and you have extracted it, it is important to clean and smooth that edge on the bone with another similar instrument, but this one should be thinner and more subtle than the other scissors.
And if any small bone fragments or splinters remain, then take them out with ease using the instruments you have; and then cure the wound with lint and ointments as we have said.
And another method of operation is gentle and far from frightening, which they call "Gualia" and praise it greatly; and this is his word: you need to start by discovering the fractured part of the bone in the place where the break is most evident and apparent. When you have discovered that part and placed underneath it the tip of this slow and gentle incision tool, the form of which is as follows:
And it is that the circular blade should be on top and not cut into anything, and the pointed blade should extend two fingers' width forward along the length of the bone, as you see; so that the circular blade is fitted against the chisel with its sharp edge against the bone.
And then strike the incision tool with a small hammer so that you cut through the entire bone easily as it turns, and be sure to protect the skin so that no accident happens that you might fear in any way, and if the patient were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their own body; certainly, even if they were asleep.
Here's the translation of the provided text:
And if the fracture of a bone does not penetrate into the soft tissue, and that which is separated or removed from the bone appears on its surface, and roughness and subtle splinters remain, then you should scrape off that roughness and remove those splinters with very sharp razors that you have prepared in diverse quantities so that it is possible for you to administer them appropriately and accurately in every place according to the nature of the operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you should administer with the razor with which you initially scrape the bone, and use progressively thinner ones, continually doing so until you can administer the thickest and thinnest of all.
But in any other small capillary or subtle fracture, you should administer care according to what is needed for its correction.
And it is necessary that this not be done on all those who have studied in this art. And we have written about this in greater detail in our work on large fractures.
And if the soft tissue is torn when you remove the bone, then take cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in warm oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another cloth, folded or triple-layered, and soak it in wine and warm oil and place it over the first cloth, and do this as lightly as possible so as not to crush the flesh; and then administer a broad bandage, but do not tighten it except by an amount equal to the size of the wound alone.
And leave him with this care for a day or two until you are sure of the abscess; and then release him and administer medicines that cause superfluous dryness, such as linseed, bran flour, ash powder, and similar substances.
And ensure that you make a powder from these medicines and apply it to the wound while it is dry; generally, administer to him any medicine whose property is to absorb moisture and not cause irritation.
And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your care is clean; and there is no negligence regarding ointment or other treatment; and do not allow virulence to increase in it; because when it is placed on the brain's membrane, it corrupts and poisons it, and then brings a similarly malignant evil upon the patient.
And it affects the brain's membrane, corrupting the bone and especially when its care is neglected, appearing black on its surface; and so consider that if such accidents befall the patient as we have said, know that it is deadly without any doubt.
And if there is no blackness other than that which comes from the medicine placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then take one part honey and three parts olive oil, and with those anoint a cloth, and place it on the membrane; and then treat him with healing remedies as appropriate until he is healed. ︎
Sure, let's go through this line by line.
"Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
"Know that the nose is not broken but rather split into two superior parts simultaneously, or one of those parts in some cases, because there are two bones within it. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; what happens to it is only attrition, twisting, and curvature.
"However, if one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert your little finger into his nose and close the fracture within with your index finger, and with your thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. "And do this for yourself easily, taking care that you do not cause pain to the patient through your operation.
"And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, then it should be flattened with the end of a reed that has been cut to an appropriate size.
"And if the fracture is in both parts, then you should do the same as described above.
"And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you must carefully remove the clot.
And promptly insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the break is in one place, or two plugs if the break is in two places, and let it be in the plug thick enough to fill the nostril.
And thus some of the ancient restorers say that the plugs should be wrapped in linen and changed every day, but I have not seen this; it is necessary that the plug be wrapped in egg white mixed with powdered chalk; and then let the plug remain until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes it is necessary to insert into the nose, in place of a plug, a thin piece of linen wrapped around a feather; and this is if the nasal fracture is very severe and the patient cannot breathe properly.
And for this reason it is not necessary for you to do so; if you wish, you can do that, or if you wish, use plugs.
And if a cold abscess occurs again, bandage the nose with wax or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with dichlorophenol.
But if a cold abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to bandage that [the wound] on the outside with sesame flour and powdered alum mixed with egg white; and then place a linen pad over it, and do not touch the nose for any reason.
Here's the translation of the provided text:
If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should cure it with warm compresses and administer lead canules until it is completely healed.
Chapter IV.
On the restoration of the jaw when it has been dislocated.
When the jaw is broken and the fracture is not caused by a wound, then consider whether the fracture is only on the outside and not split into two parts inside, which curves inward at the break; this condition is easily recognized.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, then insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of the right hand; and push with it the bulge of the fracture inside towards the outside parts with ease, while with your other hand on the outside of the bone, gently bring it together.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an extension of both parts according to straightness until it is possible for them to join together.
And if there is dislocation of the teeth, then strengthen those that you expect will remain in place with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place wax on the broken jaw, and then place a double layer of cloth over it, and place over the large cloth a well-made steel band or a single sole leather strap equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie it securely over the top in such a way that the binding is suitable and the application is convenient, until it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to rest and remain calm, and restrict their food to thin soups.
And if you believe that the shape has already been altered in some way, then cut and release it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered from them and plaster it with powder of millstone, egg white, or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax from it, and place a wool cloth over the plaster.
And when that plaster is securely attached to them and the bone's position has not changed, leave it in place until they are healed and the fracture is strong; for many times this fracture heals within three weeks.
And if an abscess occurs again, then administer what we have said many times for the healing of it until they are healed and that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or splinters; then be careful to remove those splinters with what is appropriate for removing them from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam according to your needs.
And then when you have removed those stitches, and if nothing comes out of them, then you should widen the orifice of the wound if it is large; otherwise, place one of the appropriate plasters on it that will heal it, until it is healed.
De quan se deuen poner aqests emplaustres e en que cas s'en pot abstener.
**About the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.**
Many times the collarbone is broken at its junction with the muscle in front, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is broken, separated, or split into two parts without causing any splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is such that there are splinters in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is such that the fracture is accompanied by bruising.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without bruising, is for you to have two assistants present, so that one holds and follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards that side.
And then you bring the fracture together with your said fingers until it is shaped as it should be, without any prominence or concavity.
And if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a support of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the collarbone and shorten the support with your hand until you bring the fracture together as it should be. ️
This sentence can be translated as: "And if you cannot pull the end of the bone (furcula) out through the split opening, because it has entered the lung, then the patient should be placed on their back with a large cushion under their shoulder.
And the minister presses the muscles of the patient at the parts where the clavicle is elevated, as if it were in the breast above, and then you correct the fracture and immobilize it with your words.
But if you feel splinters from the clavicle and they are sharp, then it is necessary to cut over that area and extract those splinters with ease.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then you should ingeniously make an incision with one of the incisions that you have prepared for this purpose, since you had placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a chisel; and this tool is made of wood or iron, and this is its shape:
And it resembles a chisel with this being its concavity; and let its width be according to what you need from it, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But let the length of it be according to what is possible for you in the operation; that it has two ends as you see, and one end is wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound that you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are sure to guard against pus, then you should join the two lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the wound is small or you fear the formation of an abscess, then you fill the wound with cloth and bandages according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if you suspect an abscess, then pour vinegar, rose oil, and wine into a cloth, and place it on that area.
And all this, without the bandage being too tight over the broken bone; therefore, you should check on the patient every day, because when the lint is softened or you see that the bandage has been loosened, then you should rectify it and strengthen the bandage.
And now place the patient's pillow under his head, and put a small cushion under his heels at night; so that with this, the helper is raised to the side of the patient, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is raised by the elevation of the muscle; or the patient's arm may be tied to the patient's neck.
And do not remove the bandage unless there is an increase in swelling or pus formation in that area within twelve days.
And then renew the dressing if you have seen that the area has turned blue, and adjust it in the stricture and restore that, and leave it until the clavicle fracture is restored and coagulated.
And it should be strengthened and made comfortable according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter .vi.
On the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
Sure, here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
And so when the part of the patient is broken — and it is broken in half — and is only known by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, forcefully prepare the patient and reduce that according to the natural shape in every way you can possibly do.
And then place powder of ground alum with egg white and stop leaking [the wound]; and then place folded cloth powder; and then place on it a thin wooden splint according to the amount of the whole spatula or slightly more.
But if the splint is concave in some parts of the spatula, then you fill that concavity with stop leak [material], and then raise the splint according to equality.
And then strengthen it on top with a long bandage, wrapping tightly and securely with the splint so that it is not moved from its place.
And observe the bandage each day; and whenever it is softened, bind it again and strengthen and straighten the splint if it has moved from its place.
And lay the patient on their side [or back].
And the spatula is restored in twenty days or in thirty-five.
And so when this period is completed, then you dissolve the bandage, and know that it is safe because this is a bone condition for which neither the onset nor the resolution is feared.
And if it concerns the place of the bone pressure and you put a rope underneath, then cut over it, remove it, and act according to what we said about the fracture of the furcular abscess if this happens here.
Chapter VII.
On the restoration of a foot fracture.
The foot sometimes breaks in its middle part and this is delayed; but the ends of it move quickly and are split and crushed.
And its symptoms when it is broken in the middle are that it inclines towards the inner parts and great pain occurs, as well as difficulty in breathing, coughing, strong fever, and vomiting blood; and a cavity is seen in the broken bone and is not hidden from sensation.
Its restoration is that the patient be made to lie on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulder blades; then press on their muscles and adjust their ribs with the hands of two assistants, and be subtle in the operation of it and in the equalization according to all possible ways and what is suitable for it, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
And then place on the patient an emplaster and wool, and place over them a thin sheet of willow or hazel wood, or something similar in lightness, since you wrap that in cloth; and then carefully apply it to the broken bone so that it is not too tight; and go around the back with bandages according to the roundness several times, and strengthen that with decent tightness; and then always consider the bandage, and when it becomes softened, strengthen it.
And if the need arises to remove that because of suppuration or pus, pain, or an abscess occurring in that place, then you cut and loosen it and remove the emplaster and rectify what occurs by treating it; and then reapply the emplaster if the flesh has adhered to it; and adjust the tightness until it is healed.
Chapter VIII.
Of the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that fractures of the ribs only occur in large places, such as the back; and at their ends, on the anterior side, they do not affect them except by this, because they are cartilaginous there. And to know more about him, you should not hide your feelings; instead, inquire using these words.
And the restoration should be done by closing the fracture with words according to the most possible way, until it is completely healed as needed, and then bandage and strengthen the broken bone with iron if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inside, then severe pain and puncture occur in the patient, similar to the puncture that occurs to those who have pleurisy, because the bone penetrates the membrane; and difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood occur; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the ancients were ingenious in that with ingenious words.
And of their words it is said: it is necessary to place food for the patient that causes swelling and flatulence, so that the stomach is filled and extended, and the fracture is pushed towards the outside parts.
But we prefer this, because it is not a light cause for generating an abscess, if it does not happen; and if it happens, then it helps to treat it.
And some of them said that it should be placed on a foment and then sucked with strength; and this seems reasonable, but still there is fear that the foment will attract superfluities to the place due to weakness.
Here's the translation of the provided sentence:
Based on the provided text and the context of a medieval medical treatise, here's a line-by-line translation:
And then we must join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and treat it with dressings until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you cut and press powder in rose oil onto the area, and let the patient be healed with water that suits the abscess inside.
And let him lie on his back on the bed where he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter IX.
On the repair of a fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and later it affects their function, similarly with the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider: for if you see their muscles already softened and stupefied and dead, and they cannot move those nor extend nor strengthen those, and when you press those with your fingers or prick them with a needle and there is no pain in those, then you know that it is not healed, and in the same way, it is fatal.
And if they move those and feel constriction with your fingers and pricking, then you know that the bone of the neck is safe and that the patient will heal with care.
And if you see swelling in the neck like this and you want to know if it will heal or not, then consider his feet.
And if you see that they are already softened, do to him what has been done to the hands, and then when he lies on his back, there is flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he leans back on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that it is fatal, and therefore do not work on his cure.
But if none of these causes occur, the cause is better and lighter.
And his cure is that you make an incision at the pustule cautiously and place on it pure oil or with a little bit of honey, place this on it several times during the day until the pustule is drained.
And then place one of the comforting and soothing plasters on it, and strengthen with a bandage; and instruct the patient to rest and be calm and not sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if there is a fracture of the shinbone or any other cause that has already separated from him, then it is necessary to place it on the side and remove that bone; and then adjust the two lips of the wound, with sutures if it is large; and then cure it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
Based on the provided text and patterns, here's my attempt at translating the given sentence:
"And if you sense that the stitches have broken in him, then you should sew them up again, remove what is causing the pain, and treat the wound with the previously prescribed remedy until it is healed.
"Chapter X
"On restoring the breath (or spirit).
"The bones of the ribs are often broken, and if they do break, the fracture occurs only at their extremities, and they are driven inward along their length, bending toward the inside parts; and the patient experiences pain and puncturing in that area, and the limb becomes numb when it is broken.
"And to restore him, you should place your hand on that area until it covers the fracture, which matches his shape.
"And if the fracture is only at the extremity, then you should enclose it according to how it appears to you by wrapping it evenly until it resembles its natural shape.
"But if the fracture is along the length or has already bent toward the inner parts, then you should make the patient lie on their back until you are ready to restore that fracture. "And then when you have wrapped it, place on him an emplaster, and then place on that a board of wood or leather, and bind tightly so that you do not fear the penetration of the fracture or displacement of the board.
And fill the cavity with water that fills it until it reaches the narrowest part equally, and tell the patient to sleep on their back or on their side.
But if you notice an abscess forming, then cease from extending it and its restoration until the abscess is subdued. Place water on it to cool it down as previously instructed; then return to restoring him, and strengthen that part as needed.
And if the bone is shattered or splintered, then treat it.
Chapter XI
On the restoration of the fractured ankle.
Ankle is that which is between the knee and the top of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration can be done in one of two ways. The first way is to take a flat stick of medium size like this:
And tie ligaments on both ends, and then suspend it from a high place.
And have the patient sit on a stool; and then place their broken arm over the stick until it reaches the tip of the bone at the middle point where the curve of the stick is located.
Sure, let's translate this line by line:
This is the translation of the given text:
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then strengthen over the fracture with one bandage and on it with another bandage, and each of the two assistants should stretch at their respective ends.
And therefore, if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then half of the bandage should be placed above the patella and the other half below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then place the bandage over that area and also over the elbow.
Wrap it with ease and without excessive effort, and when it is wrapped according to what is needed and correctly applied, then strengthen it, unless an abscess occurs, be careful.
But if an abscess occurs, then leave the dressing in place for seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rosemary oil over it until the abscess subsides, and then strengthen it.
And the way to strengthen it is to place a poultice over the fracture, and then wrap a bandage of new cloth around the poultice; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over its corresponding muscle.
It seems like you've provided a sentence from a medieval medical text, but I can only see the prompt asking for translation and no actual sentence to translate. Could you please provide the sentence that needs to be translated into English?
And then use needles.
And it is that you should place on the fracture the needle which is the sharpest and strongest of the other needles; and place between each needle the width of a finger, and let the length of the needles be according to the break with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Then strengthen the needles with the ligature that was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your ligature on the place of the fracture be very tight. And the longer the fracture is, the tighter the ligature should be.
And thus if you see the arrangement of the needles and the ligature as we have said at the time when you restore the member to its place, then do it.
And if you fear that an abscess will form, then leave the ligature and the needles in place for seven days as we have said.
Then consider the ligature in all parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation does not occur in the place; or it is prohibited that food reaches the member by excess tightness of the ligature; and thus correct everything according to what we have said.
"But if you are confident that nothing will happen due to this, then do not remove the bandage until after three days or more.
"And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands be on their stomach.
"And place on the injured limb a cushion full of wool equally, and be careful at all times of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or loosened, so correct this with all your skill.
"And feed the patient according to the order that we mentioned earlier, so that the food is light at first until it starts to strengthen; and then you should make the food heavier for them.
"For it is customary for the injured leg and the thigh to be strengthened in forty days; therefore, they should then be released, and a bath should be administered, and it should be treated with ointments that correct this.
"And if the fracture is delayed in healing, then you should not remove the bandage and splints from it until after one month or two months.
Chapter XII.
On the restoration of a broken arm.
Bras is composed of two bones called the humerus; one is small and is known as the ulna, while the other is large and is placed below the small bone, towards the elbow.
A strong blow can break only the larger bone (humerus), or only the smaller one (ulna), and sometimes both are broken together.
And when the smaller bone is broken higher up (closer to the elbow), then its restoration is easier, and its healing is faster.
And when the bone is broken lower down (closer to the wrist), then the fracture is serious and healing is difficult.
And worse still is when two bones are broken simultaneously.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller one higher up (closer to the elbow), then it is appropriate for the physician to apply a small extension with ease until it is equalized.
However, if it is the larger bone that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a more vigorous extension.
And if both bones are broken simultaneously, then it is necessary for you to apply the traction much more strongly.
And it is necessary to apply the hand figure for its restoration and extend the extension over a cushion, with the palm of the hand on the upper parts, more than all other fingers, and the little finger lower than the others, and let the patient sit on a low chair.
And place a cushion in front of the patient, either at the head or foot, so that the patient does not exert themselves.
And then the assistant should extend the patient's arm from the side towards them with their hand or bandage, and another assistant should do the same above it.
And then the doctor should wrap the bones together until they are reduced in the best shape possible.
And if there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then remove all the pieces from their place with your skill.
And if it appears to you that the splinter is separated and touches the cord and is not in your expectation for its restoration, then cut above it and remove it according to the manner we have said above.
But if the fracture is with wound, I have already made a special chapter about that, and therefore take care of it as described therein.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with oil and white wax ointment, which is midway between thinness and thickness, and stretch a strong, thin cloth over it until the abscess has subsided; then remove the bandage and place a plaster prepared from powdered wheat flour and egg white on it, and then place splints; and let the splint that is placed on that fracture be wider and stronger.
And know that the number of stars on the arm corresponds to major dispositions, whether it is a fracture in one finger or in two fingers at once.
And then place your thumb more firmly and strongly over the site of the fracture. The more the area affected by the fracture extends to the upper or lower parts, the moister the thumb should be placed, as was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths used to wrap around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough. The bandage used to secure it should be of medium thickness, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.
And consider the member and the binding for several days. And if any cause occurs for which correction is necessary, as happens to the member, and then it is necessary that you immerse the member in hot water until that swelling subsides.
And let the member rest without constraint until it calms down, and then apply the bandage again.
And if the bandage is already soft and the bone has healed and appears as such, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to an excess of stricture (tightness), for then it is necessary to soften that area slightly and leave it alone for some days until the nourishment reaches that part, and then strengthen it.
But if the patient does not experience any of those causes that we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to keep him confined for about 20 days or around that number.
And then the patient's hand should be suspended due to its power of agitating movements, and make them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or in 32 days, or very lightly it is restored in 28 days, and all of this depends on the disposition of the complexion and the dispositions of the power (virtue).
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the little finger and the toes.
Know that in the little finger and the toes of the feet, it is rare for a fracture to occur, and nothing happens to them except bruises from time to time.
And when the hand suffers from a fracture or bruise, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on his side and in front of him place a cushion according to the size, and then place his hand on that cushion extended.
"And then the nurse should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should reduce them until they are properly aligned with good alignment.
"And then it is necessary to place a plaster and wool, otherwise an abscess may form; and then place a steel plate on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in linen.
"But if the break is in the middle of the finger, you must open the palm of the hand. Then make a shape similar to a ball of cloth and instruct the patient to grip it with their broken hand; then wrap it tightly with long cloth.
"And let the steel plate be made of leather wrapped in cloth, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as necessary.
"But if the fracture is at the outer part of the finger, then it is necessary to place one steel plate on top and another steel plate on the inner part of the palm, so that the hand remains open and straight; and then bind the splints as the hand is rotated between the fingers with bandages.
"And if there is a fracture in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the finger, it should be reduced as necessary and then bound to the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight steel plate on it so that the fracture is elevated and not displaced.
Here's a line-by-line translation of the given sentence:
And consider, in your restoration and healing, the position of the abscess — with your operation — with that which is necessary when any cause occurs from those, according to how the story is told of him/her.
Chapter 14
Of the restoration of a broken bone in the hip.
The bones of the thigh are frequently injured and it is detected by touch as it turns into the front part and the upper part.
And the restoration of it is done thus: the ligament is strengthened over the fracture and another ligament beneath the fracture, and the patient lies on their stomach and face down.
And then the minister extends all the ligaments to their respective parts according to quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then let the ligament be close to the knee in the direction of the shinbone, so that the extension fits well, and the other ligament beneath the fracture.
Similarly, if the break is near the knee, then let the ligament be made close to the knee and the extension should be towards the lower parts.
Sure, let's try to translate the provided text: "But if an abscess occurs in the patient, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess has drained on its own, and then return to your treatment.
"The stricture of the patient should be done in this way: it is necessary to wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, and fold that two or three times, removing excess material; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the beginning of the calf.
"Then insert a long needle between the thigh and the leg close to the bone at the separated parts, and let the ends of the thread emerge from the higher part of the two parts; then wrap around the leg and the thigh that which overflows from the bandage.
"Then place on the thigh in the location of that fracture splints, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
"Then fill the empty spaces between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths, so that the stricture is tightened.
"And then begin with a strong binding in the middle on the location of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you get further from the location of the fracture, your binding should be lighter, moister, and more flexible.
And then extend both ends of the thread to the separated parts until it reaches the base of the foot, and strengthen both ends of the strings on the other side to ensure that the ligament remains in its place.
And then leave the structure on that part so that it does not cause corrosion or pustules, swelling or similar conditions to the member; and if any of those occur, then you should remove it from him, and correct what has occurred as soon as possible, just as we have said many times.
But if there is pressure on the bone where it is placed, then you should remove it as much as possible; and if not, cover it with a cloth and leave it, and treat it with the remedy mentioned earlier until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is strengthened with other things than just strings, as we have said in the case of the arm and the shoulder.
But nevertheless, in such a restoration of the patient, limping does not occur; and if it is restored alone or if the other leg is applied, then it is necessary for that person to always limp on the side where it was initially injured.
And know that the cushion should be kept for forty days or a little more or less, and all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter XV.
On the restoration of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the dislocation of the shoulder is slow to heal, but occurs more often due to excessive dryness.
But if it is a fracture, then it is only a fracture or break in its parts, and this can be with pain or without pain, and above all, it depends on the sensation.
And the restoration of it is such that what is broken from its parts is made equal again with the aforementioned means, until it is joined and united as much as possible by equality, facility, and craftsmanship.
And then place a plaster and place it on that round table if you need it; and strengthen it above with a bandage as appropriate.
And then consider all the precautions that we have recommended for other fractures, such as avoiding inflammation and similar things, so that one may avoid any accident with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Capitolo XVI.
Di restauro della frattura della coscia.
Sappi che nella coscia ci sono due ossa: una è grande e si chiama femore; l'altra è sottile e si chiama tibia.
E succede a ciascuna delle specie di frattura che succede alle due ossa del braccio, e pertanto la riparazione avviene allo stesso modo della riparazione del braccio, e l'operazione è la stessa.
E se sono fratturate entrambe le ossa contemporaneamente, la coscia diventa completamente rotta.
E se è frantumata l'osso più sottile, la coscia si rompe davanti.
E se è fratturato l'osso più grande, questo rimane dietro, ed è una delle cause che non sono sotto il tuo controllo.
E pertanto amministri estensione, stabilità e legatura delle stecche allo stesso modo. heit
Tuttavia, se la frattura della coscia è liscia con pochi spigoli vivi, allora l'estensione deve essere minore e più leggera, e alleggerisci con il tuo giudizio.
And in the thigh there is some cause for operation on the arm, and this occurs when you dislocate the shoulder joint and complete all the parts of the operation, then take wooden pegs that are placed under the knees which are placed under the soles; these are made similarly from palm branches; choose those with small thickness and not at all large, and their length should be according to the length of the thigh, and insert them into the wound.
Then wrap each one in two cloths according to its length, and place one on the beginning of the thigh from one side and the other from the opposite side, and let them be inserted into the wound below the foot.
Then tie the two pegs in three places: at both ends and in the middle, because with this structure the thigh is prevented from inclining to the right or left, and it remains stable.
And a splint of wood has been administered according to the length of the thigh, and it should be placed on it for preserving its position against movement.
And especially this is done in cases of fracture, when there is a wound present as well.
And then consider each day the thigh and study it with care, for later studies. You should guard against abscesses or inflammation, or other similar causes; and if any of these causes occur, then stay close to the patient until he is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the Fracture of the Ankle and Bones of the Foot and Toes.
The ankle does not break completely; rather, it is the bones of the foot that sometimes break. As for the toes of the foot, they rarely break, and only receive bruises due to poor posture.
And if the bones of the foot should be broken and you see those bones raised above each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared like this:
And then place one foot on top of the raised bones, and step on them, press down, and grind them until they return to their proper places.
And then place a poultice and bandage on top, and place beneath the sole of the foot a small board with two flat sides.
And then strengthen that with the foot in a straight and tense position, since you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary things.
And when three days or four pass by, then you should loosen the bandage, because you will find the bones either swollen, or dislocated, and the operation on them is as if you knew it.
But if some bones are dislocated, then restore those and swathe them as I have instructed you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint on the dislocated finger according to its length, and let it be somewhat wider than the finger; and then lay the foot on this table which has been recommended to you, and strengthen that with a suitable bandage.
But if what is dislocated are two or three or more bones, then you should place a splint of the corresponding size, wrapped in linen cloth, on each finger; and strengthen the table at the lowest part of the foot, and let it stand on one end of the table's hole for the belly of the foot so that it has good retention.
And it is advisable for you not to forget that you should consider all the causes which have been told to you in other fractures of the accidents which we have mentioned; and prepare yourself for any accident with what is necessary.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the fracture of the woman's thigh bone, and the man's penis bone, and the man's member.
When the woman's thigh bone is broken, then make her sit in an armchair, and then incline it towards the back a little, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife should fill the thigh with cotton, and it should be done in her thigh as in a spear; and then the woman should be shaken, and her back should be raised little by little, because all this is forgotten until the bone is returned to its place before the fracture.
And then place pillows on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease and then she urinates, and returns and comes back as she was at the beginning, and then returns to her first pillow.
And do this for seven days or around that time, because by then it will be healed.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and fasten a reed tube onto its opening; and introduce the entire bladder into her thigh, and then blow air into the tube with all your might until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, because the fracture returns. 😊
And then fill it with cotton and let it rest for several days, as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bones of a man or woman's hip are fractured, then administer for their restoration and mending that which we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is correct is not hidden in these near fractures and which happen infrequently, especially to those who have some knowledge and use of and understand this book of mine; for that fracture indicates to you the major dispositions in the straight way of restoration and stricture of it, and therefore understand well.
However, when a man's penis is fractured, take an egg yolk, and put the penis in it; then place over it a cloth wrapping, and let it be wrapped, and then leave it for three days or around that time, until it is healed.
Chapter XIX.
Of the restoration of bones when they are with a wound.
It is appropriate for one to whom a fracture with a wound occurs, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or shinbone, or similar to that, that you cauterize it and fleubotomize it immediately if the conditions of fleubotomy testify to it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then you should cauterize the patient's wound so that you can powder over it burnt eggshells, unless there is another cause for it.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs, then you should leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it in the third or fourth day, because you will cause bad outcomes.
But if the broken bone is prominent and exposed over the knee, then you should pierce through it to reduce it and make it level with your hands, using ease and a small extent.
But if the length is not adequate and the alignment of it with your hands, then you should reduce it with these instruments; and this instrument is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight digits [fingers], and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this reason, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these according to what is needed in all kinds of fractures.
And if he is weakened and in him there is little flesh for the reason that he not be bent, you must have a precaution over him during the operation.
And if there is an acute extremity which has a margin in its extremities; and it is above him, swollen, and from the middle of him to the divided parts.
And this is his form:
And it is called in Greek "labretus volens atelarem," which means little spoon.
Therefore, the sharp end should be placed with the sharp part raised above the prominent bone.
And you push it once until the bone returns and is equalized with some liquid.
And therefore strive to equalize the extremities of the fracture between them, and if the broken extremity is thin and does not accept that instrument well, then it is necessary for you to insert the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone entirely with what we have mentioned, then incise it with one of the incising tools that we have spoken of; or saw it with a saw in whatever manner is possible for you.
And then scrape off what remains on the bone in the form of small rough patches.
And when the bone has been reduced, and then if the patient finds a strong toothache, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then you will do what you can to help the patient greatly.
After completing the bone repair that you have performed, then submerge a cloth in black stiptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place wax or any other substance containing oil on the wound, so that rotting and corruption do not occur in it.
Then administer stelas at the time of your completion of the bone repair, and leave the wound open so that you can cut out the dead tissue with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to strain the wound with the fracture, for many times the foolish doctors have done this and caused death or severe illness in their patients, which is unfortunate. And if the stringency is light, soften it, unlike the stringency of other fractures.
Certainly! Let's translate the given text line by line:
And when the wound begins to appear after a day or two, and pus has formed in it, then remove the cloth that you had placed over it with honey, and apply cupping glasses, along with ointments with which we are accustomed to treating wounds, such as tetrapharmacum and similar ointments.
And it is necessary for you to remove the bandage and observe the wound each day morning and evening until it is healed and firm, and it is important that the member be prepared in such a way that the putrefaction flows out of it to the parts below with ease.
If many days have passed and the wound is not healed nor has the pus separated from it, then know that here are small maggots for which it is necessary to clean the wound with a probe. And of those maggots, those which are separated should be removed and extracted, but those which cannot be separated and cause the member to swell and produce pain, you must pierce them according to what is possible for you.
And if there is suppuration or corruption at the wound, whether it is stench or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you should place one of these [remedies] on it, which are fitting for it from the treatment of which has been mentioned earlier in its chapter.
This text appears to be discussing the treatment of a dislocated bone. Here's a line-by-line translation:

About the treatment of swelling that occurs in the aftermath of a fracture.
Many injuries occur as a result of this swelling in the aftermath of a fracture healing process, especially when it is near the joints and changes the shape of the limb; it also greatly hinders the member from its natural function.
Therefore, consider whether the swelling is recent and administer those medicines that have astringent properties such as aloe, henna, mira, sarsaparilla, and crab's eye; take some or all of these, mix them with astringent wine, egg white, or vinegar, apply it to the swelling on cloth, and tightly bind it over the area with a good constriction.
And let the bandage not be loosened for several days; then loosen it and apply another one, until the swelling subsides; or strengthen over it a lead plate, because lead has the property of reducing all inflammation in the members.
But if the swelling has already hardened and is tight, and it is necessary to remove it urgently, then cut it along its highest part, and cut away the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with sharp instruments until it subsides; and treat it until it heals.
It seems that the text you provided begins with "Capitol .xxi." which likely means "Chapter 21" in modern English. This indicates the start of a new section or chapter in the medieval medical treatise. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide more detail, but this is a common way to structure such documents by dividing them into distinct sections for ease of reference and reading.
**About the repair of a fracture, when it is repaired and then the member is made subtle and weak, not according to its nature.**
**When a bone fracture is repaired, and the member remains subtle and weak afterward, this happens for several reasons: one of which is an excess of loosening or insufficient binding of the sutures; or because of excessive tightness of the bindings so that nutrition to the member is obstructed; or because of unnecessary excess in bandaging; or because of unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or because of a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.**
**The treatment for this is to give the patient food to eat and make their heart tender until blood is increased in them; and administer baths; and introduce joy and happiness into them.**
**And then place a poultice on the member so that the poultice draws the necessary nutrition to it, or continue bandaging it with warm water until the nourishment flows and the member returns to its natural shape.**
Chapter 22
Of caring for fractured bones when they are set crookedly, and the operation to correct this is prohibited.
When the member has already healed crookedly and with a bump on the fractured bone due to the irregular shape of the member, yet the member is not prohibited from its natural operation, then you should not accept the word of one who claims that the member was freshly broken.
However, there have been foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very reprehensible, leading to great fear of death.
But if the limping and swelling are recent, then they should be soaked in lukewarm water in which have been infused softening herbs such as leaves of mallow and roots of marshmallow, and melilot, and similar herbs; and a poultice should be made with a softening agent such as well-made liniment or a paste of crushed marshmallow root mixed with oil of cypress, and applied with that; or fat figs can be taken and ground with pigeon dung, and similar to the other medicines named for soothing consolidation.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle continuous friction that should be done with wet hands, and the member should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the tortuosity has already passed and it is made strong and turned into stone, and a cure by iron becomes necessary, then it is appropriate that the most superior part of the bone be cut off, and the continuation of the bone be dissolved, and what superfluous comes from the knot of that same member with fine saws, and ease should be administered to him with care and study.
Chapter 23.
On dislocation.
A dislocation is the displacement of one of its joints from its place, which restricts movement and alters the shape of the member, causing great pain and injury in the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to immediately make a hole so that it can be reduced, and do not delay this reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes swollen and hard with water, making the reduction of the dislocation difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched during the time of swelling, because many times it brings on cramps and severe pain.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
And let each member be treated with water from which the memory will come to its place.
And I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation as preceded in fracture, from the highest part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
On the cure for dislocation of the lower jaw.
If both jaws are dislocated, and it is not delayed; the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways: either they are moved a little from their places and become somewhat softened, or they are completely dislocated until they become softened at the joint, to the point that saliva runs from the patient's mouth and he cannot hold it or close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped in itself.
However, when the dislocation is minor, it usually returns to its place on its own with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary to administer a gentle reduction to him, and not to delay it at all.
And the assistant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert his thumb from one hand into the mouth of the patient on the side of the dislocated jaw, if the dislocation is on one side; or he should insert both thumbs together if the dislocation is on both sides, and with the other fingers of his hands, he should grip outside. And he should command the patient to relax his jaws and let them go in any direction; and the physician should gently pull and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction of him is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer a fumigation with hot water and oil until a slight reduction is achieved for both, so that the total reduction does not delay as we have said.
And then when they return and are swollen, and the mouth of the patient is closed and not softened, then place those powdered cloths with wax and oil-soaked ribbons on them, and bind it gently with soft bands.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their head between two pillows, so that they do not turn to the right or left; and do not force them to eat anything; their food should be finely chopped bread, until when the pains are lessened and the jaws are joined, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered gently, and do not worry about opening the mouth for eating, drinking, or speaking until the jaw is joined and healed.
And if the reduction of both jaws is difficult when they are dislocated and do not return to their places, then give frequent fumigations with cold water and strong vinegar, and quickly raise the patient's belly, and quickly induce vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a serious condition; and many times the one who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
On reducing the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the humerus.
The clavicle is not dislocated from the back of the chest towards the feet due to its continuous nature with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards at the joint, which can be determined by touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. Then firmly press the area with your palm, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and poultice on it and bind it tightly.
However, the end of that which is the shoulder and its continuation with it is not dislocated in any day; therefore, it should be reduced and splinted as we have said and according to your ability.
Then place on it a plaster, poultice, and bandage, and instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the end of the humerus can be reduced when it is separated from its place.
Capítulo XXVI
Sobre la reducción de la dislocación muscular.
Sé que el músculo no se disloca excepto en tres formas. Una de estas formas es cuando está dislocado desde la parte del dedo gordo hasta la parte de los pies.
La segunda forma es cuando está dislocado en la parte superior del músculo, y esto es poco común; y no se disloca en las partes posteriores por el hombro; y no se disloca en las partes anteriores por los nervios.
Y generalmente se disloca y sale por las partes inferiores del dedo gordo, y más comúnmente en aquellos cuya carne es escasa, se disloca ligeramente; pero en aquellos con mucha carne, sale afuera con dificultad.
Y sucede a menudo en algunos hombres debido a un golpe o caída, y el músculo del hombre se llena de hinchazón y se cree que ya está dislocado.
Por lo tanto, es necesario que tú investigues esto antes de estar seguro de ello, y luego procede con su tratamiento.
Here's the translation of the given sentence:
If the foot or ankle is dislocated, and you then find obvious contact, which is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, a slight reduction can be made when it is fresh, and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the attendant raises the patient's hand above the part; and then places his fingers under the tip of the toe, and lifts the joint strongly to its place, and the attendant raises the patient's hand, and extends it outward; and then places it down because it returns slightly.
But if, as we have said, it does not return, and from the beginning where the dislocation occurred, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water and an embrocation be administered that softens and soothes, such as a coat made of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered.
Then the patient should be laid on their back and a roll of wool, balanced between softness and firmness, should be placed under their toe. And the doctor should place his heel on the roll, and lift the tip of the muscle with all his strength, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not hidden below the parts, and another attendant should hold the patient's head, so that it is not pulled downwards, because this quickly returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce that second one in this manner: it is for you to have present a man who is taller than the patient and stands on the opposite side of the bed; he should then insert his muscle under the patient's armpit and lift the patient's armpit until they are suspended in the air, while another attendant pulls the patient's hand from their lap. But if the patient is light, then another person should be suspended with them to make them heavier, because the dislocation will return quickly otherwise.
And it is reduced in yet another way: by placing on the ground a long pole with a rounded head, similar to a pestle, not too thick nor too thin; then place the patient under them, with cloths placed over the pole's head, and make the patient stand according to the length of the pole, extending their arm outwards from one side while strongly pulling their leg in the opposite direction, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the reasons mentioned, then use this cure: take a pole whose length is two arms' length and whose thickness is four fingers, with its thickness decreasing towards the top like this:
And then on the head, tie down linen cloths so that the post does not hurt the patient.
Then place a pillow under the patient's head and extend your hand or arm over the post between the fingers, and tie the post around the assistants and the arms and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its width, and extend the hand between the fingers, and let the other thing hang from the other side, because the joint is about to enter.
And when its insertion is complete according to each manner that is possible for you, then it is necessary that you place under the head a woolen pad of sufficient size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered mole's blood and egg white over all the muscle, so that it is wrapped around, and then bind it tightly under the head with a proper bandage; and let the bandage be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be tied to their neck, and let it be left for seven days, and do not move the patient's hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be kept light until the limb is healed, because this is more conducive to their recovery.
And the food should be given with greater care for seven or five days; and thus if it is stopped and not softened, then it is already healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or for another reason, then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three punctures in that area, as previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firmly set, and the plaster and the stricture are placed on it several times, and it is not firm but hangs and cannot raise that arm to its usual position, then know that the nerves of the patient, which are at the top of the muscle, are already cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never again be in its proper place.
Of the dislocation that is made of the feet and nipples or the back parts, the reduction is done with pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.
And the other stricture should be applied to that area, and care for it until it is healed.
And if heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness of movement during healing, then the patient should bathe many times until that heaviness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
It appears that you provided only a chapter number in Latin, "Capitol .xxvii." This translates directly to "Chapter 27" in English.
About the care of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions, especially forward and backward. The dislocation of it is not hidden from you because it appears through sight or touch according to whatever shape it is dislocated in, and when you set the dislocated shoulder back in place, this is made clear to you because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch its own muscle.
And it is necessary that you cut and quickly reduce the dislocation before the inflammation comes, because if the inflammation comes, it is difficult to reduce it, and it will not be healed completely; especially when it is in the posterior direction, for of all other species of dislocation, it is the worst, with greater pain, and many have died from that.
And the reduction of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm should be spread out, and the doctor's hands should be on the shoulder and under it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the edge of his palm until it returns to its place.
"However, if the dislocation is at the front, then turn it back such that you bend the hand with its own hand, until the elbow strikes the base of the palm.
"And if the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then apply strong extension and great force.
"And let two assistants extend the arm, and hold it firmly in place with two assistants so that it is not moved away from the extension.
"And then the arm should be turned in all directions, since it is wrapped in a long folded cloth around its hand or bandage.
"And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this helps with the lubrication of the joint and ease; and then forcefully press the joint until it returns.
"And after the reduction, it is necessary that a poultice of astringent and desiccating properties be placed on it, made with egg white, and it should be tightly bandaged, and the arm should be suspended from the neck and left for several days.
"And then it should be unwrapped; and thus if the joint is formed in its place, then you may unwrap the bandage from him and leave it.
"And if you see that the joint is not strengthened, then you should reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for several days until it becomes strengthened; then remove it.
"But if there is a serious issue near the reduction of the joint and the person's condition is restless, then administer moistening baths and gentle friction, and compresses until it is relieved; or place on the joint some lead weights as a heavy immobile mass; and then it should be bound, and left there day and night. "Then remove that, and put the person in a bath; and when they come out, then you should rub the joint with cool friction, and then reapply on the joint lead weights as circular motion, one time, and the second, and the third. "in the bath mixture, until it is soothed.
"And if you wish, place on it a wet and scraped cowhide patch with a border and strengthen it; and do this several times, because that is moist and reduces to its condition.

Chapter 29.
About the treatment of dislocations in the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated entirely.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at the back of the palm or on the front of it, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back into place with your thumbs until it returns to its proper position.
And then support the tip of the finger and suspend that part from which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And then suspend that part and stretch it until it is straightened in its own day.
And when it is night, bind that according to the previous account, and do not cease unbinding it during the day and exercising with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And act as if with water, if it is dislocated in the hand of the person, and join that to that part and do with water the first operation until it is healed.
And similarly act with water when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter XXX
Of the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When it happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck that complete dislocation occurs and many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no treatment for that, because death will come to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's defecation is expelled without his will and he cannot retain it; and many times some members of him are paralyzed, either both legs or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is moved from its place, because many times one is moved and many times the removal of those to four parts.
Therefore, that has already been moved to the back parts and is called paralysis.
But the treatment of him is that then consider if the paralysis occurs in childhood, because then there is no treatment for it and he will not be completely healed from it.
Here's the line-by-line translation of the provided text:
"And of those, only that which occurs in the back specifically is cured with what I recommend.
"And the patient should be laid face up on a low bed near the wall, and a damp cloth should be placed under him to prevent his feet from moving.
"And then place a straight stick in the ground at the head of the bed, and another one under his feet at the foot of the bed.
"And a servant should hold the stick, not fixed in the ground; and another servant should hold the other one in the same manner.
"And then wrap the head of the patient and tie it with a strong leather strap; extend the end of the strap to the stick that is next to his head, and tie it there; and then strengthen the other strap under his armpits, across his chest, and place it between his legs; and then adjust all the straps and tie them to the other stick near his feet.
"And then each servant should extend the strap to the end of the stick, and the two sticks and the straps should not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but rather, they should not be fixed as we have said.
And the physician places his palms on the spine with strength until it returns to normal, or until he places something on top of it, and then adjusts his feet on the table until it returns to normal.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms' lengths, and carve out a space in the wall near the patient, into which the end of the table can fit. And then place the middle of the table on the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and pulls strongly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open the pulley that is attached to the hand; and have the patient lie on their back with their head between two poles, the length of which should be one arm's length, and their head between two upright poles in the same way; and the distance between each pole should be one palm, and in each pole a hole should be made through which the pulley can pass, and each pole should be securely fastened to the ground so that it does not move.
And there should also be a round pole through which the pulley passes, and it should rotate in the holes of the two poles.
And at the end of it is a hole through which the shaft is formed, and its length is one hand's breadth that is wrapped; and in the other two shafts, there is something similar to this.
And then strengthen the bands that you have tightened on the patient's feet at the hole where his head is supposed to go, and the bands that you have tightened on their thighs on the other side where their legs are supposed to be.
And then there should be a servant at each turn who turns the turn with his hand, and the doctor aligns the spine as we have said.
And then, after the spine has been returned and the place has been aligned, it is necessary to put a dry plaster with egg white, and then wool; and then put on top of the plaster a board whose width should be three fingers or around that, and its length should be such that it covers the place of the swelling, and over the part of the spine.
And then it should be tied with the band that we have mentioned, and the patient should be fed with fine food until they are healed.
And if there remains any weakness in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with the administration of the board for a long time, which we have recommended; and already a lead sheet has been applied to that place.
This passage appears to be discussing the risks associated with certain treatments for bone dislocations in the spine. Here is a line-by-line translation:
It looks like you provided only the chapter number (Capitol .xxxi) without the actual text that needs translation. If you could provide the full sentence or paragraph from the medieval medical treatise, I would be happy to help translate it into English line by line as demonstrated earlier.
Sure, let's translate this chapter heading:
"Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the shoulder should only be treated as dislocations, and not like other joints that are displaced by a small movement or concavity.
"And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: it can be dislocated to the inside parts, or to the outside parts, or to the front parts, or to the back parts.
"And it is most commonly dislocated inward, and less often forward or backward.
"And the sign of its dislocation inward is that when you align the healthy thigh with the sick one, it appears longer and the outer side more prominent than on the healthy side; the patient cannot bend their knee over the heel, and this is where the swelling of hot apostema occurs, because the head of the bone has already arrived here.
"And the sign that it is dislocated outward is that its symptoms are opposite to those mentioned earlier.
"And the sign of a dislocation toward the front is that the patient's thigh stretches out straight, but cannot bend without pain on the inner side; and if he tries to walk, he cannot move forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin swells up, and he walks on the sole of his foot.
And the sign of that which occurs in a dislocation at the back part is that it does not expand the pain, nor can it bend before it bends the knee, and the leg is shorter than the other, and the knee is softened, and the head of the thighbone is depressed in that place.
But the reduction of this type of dislocation is considered if you notice whether the dislocation is old and chronic, in which case you should not attempt to reduce it and let it remain as it is, for this treatment does not apply in that situation; thus, there is no need to proceed with the procedure.
However, in the case of recent dislocation and it is one of the four types of dislocations, you should approach it by turning the joint inward and extending it to both the inner and outer parts, moving it to the right and left, for it returns quickly and does not require any other treatment.
But if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary for you to prepare a strong minister and extend the leg of the patient from below, either with his hands or with a strap that is tied above the knee on top of the pain; and another minister should extend the hand of the patient over it so that he places his hands below the hips; and then strengthen with a strap around the thigh, and let another minister support the end of the strap.
And if the extension is from the inside to the outside at the area of the fork or from the back to the area of the spine.
And if the extension is of all these at once until the patient is raised with their body off the ground and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is common to all four [limbs].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then all that is said about the proper treatment is necessary.
In the reduction of oneself, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is on the inside parts, it is necessary for the patient to be placed supine on their back; then place the levers above the upper part of the thigh, in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the lower part of the hipbone; and then extend the lever upward from the outer part of the hipbone to the highest part of the fork.
Then another strong minister should take the patient's arms and firmly grasp the thickest part of the affected thigh and strongly extend it outward, because that returns it to its place.
And this remedy is lighter in treatment than the others for reducing this member.
But if you are unable to follow and comply with this treatment method in its entirety, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient tightly together with a strong yet light bandage, covering both heels and both ankles.
And let the length of each [bandage] be four times its width, and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by two times its width.
Then have the patient hang by their head from the top of a pole, and be inverted, with the length of their body from the ground being two arm spans.
Then command a strong young man to reduce the size of the cushion, and have another strong young man hang with the patient, and this other young man should press strongly on the cushion, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
However, in the specific case of a dislocation that has exited the body, it is necessary for the patient to sit on a stool as we have recommended when they are swollen; and let the bandage be strengthened specifically on the diseased leg and on their feet.
And then two poles should be placed, one under the feet of the patient and the other under their head; and then thin poles should be placed in the middle of the bed, over which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not injured by the pole being between their thighs, for you must ensure the extension of the limbs does not cause a pull.
And then each assistant extends to their respective side, and the doctor, with his hand, guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be slightly extended, and according to this same narrative on the bed; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the patient's ankle, and then pulls it with the other hand, and with that pull, he extends it backward toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary for the patient to be extended backward, but rather raised from the ground; and it is also necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, as we have said regarding the elevation if his ankle is dislocated outward, according to what we have said about him lying on two ankles; and his face and arms should be extended, as we have said, without much difficulty.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a board onto the location where there is the joint.
Therefore, once the reduction is complete as needed — and the sign of its completion is not hidden from you, and that is when you stretch the patient's legs, and when you see those joints and the patient stretches their own leg and spreads it without complaint, then you know that the member has been properly returned to its place — at this point, you should adjust two cushions, apply poultice, and bind tightly with a bandage so that the width is not increased in any of the parts; and have the patient rest for three days or four.
Then remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
At this point, if you see those joints in their proper place, then you know that the dislocation has been properly set, and at this time allow the patient to go.
And if you see any sign of swelling, then return and apply poultice to it, and bind it tightly as you did before, and leave it for three days.
Then remove that bandage, and make the patient delay walking on each side for some days, until they are comfortable.
The translation of "Capitol .xxxii." is "Chapter 32.
Of the care for dislocation of the shoulder.
The shoulder is dislocated in three ways: it is dislocated to the front parts outside, and to the front parts inside, and to the back parts further to the back parts behind; and it is not dislocated to the front parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his thigh to his shoulder; then you know that the shoulder is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its ways is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he can extend his leg if possible; then press your back against his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then have another person press the patient's shoulder with their palms, and hold them firmly above the patient's shoulder. And have another assistant stretch their foot until the shoulder returns to its place.
And the sign of reduction is that his thigh adheres to his shoulder with effortless ease.
Then bandage it and have the thigh adhere to the shoulder, and then tie them together with a bandage for three days or four, and then unbind them.
And do not let the patient walk for some days, until they are healed and comforted.
But if the reduction of them to you is impossible, then administer strong extension with ligaments which in the cure of the hip have been previously described.
Chapter XXXIII.
Of the treatment for dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle sometimes is slightly displaced by small movement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to custom, and the dislocation of it occurs either at the inner or outer parts.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the ankle swelling towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for its slight displacement is easy reduction, which is that it be extended gently with the hands and then bandaged until it returns to its proper place.
But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to custom, it is necessary that you make the patient lie down straight, and let him have a strong and capable assistant behind his back in the middle of him.
And then take with your right hand the foot from the upper side, and with your left hand from the lower side of the foot in the ankle area.
And then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand, and then with your left for two times, and then extend with your left; and bend the toes of the foot towards the right behind the thigh without effort.
And do this twice as we have agreed upon.
And then bend the toes of the foot to the thigh for the third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if you return once or twice in this manner, and if you see the foot swollen, it is good; otherwise, then repeat the operation on him, because he will return (to the original state).
But if it is forbidden for you to reduce him with this that we have recommended, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and strengthen a pillow firmly on the ground, and let it be placed between his thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth over him so that the patient does not burn.
And then one of his attendants should hold his thighs, and another attendant should extend the foot with their hands or with a cloth that lies on top of the foot's neck; and each attendant should be extended against the extension of their partner, and the pillow should be stretched between the patient's thighs holding it, so that his body is not pulled to the parts below its extension.
And the doctor immediately places his hands on the dislocation, and another attendant holds the healthy side at the ends of it, because the dislocation returns easily.
And when the dislocation returns and its healing is apparent to you, then place a poultice and bind it strongly with bandages, and bind the foot to the thigh with a bandage.
And be careful or take care of the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not too strong and presses them firmly.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage has softened, remove it.
And then unbind it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. ✓ But if the patient is forced to walk before that time, it is not certain that the dislocation will not be dissolved and ruined on them, and then it will not receive treatment.
And if an abscess forms on them, then you should administer in its opening that which we previously mentioned in another place of treatment and application, until it is removed.
Chapter XXXIV
On the treatment of displacement of the toes.
It is advisable that the person who is displaced be treated with little extension without effort; and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the displacement is in some of the toes at the back of the foot, then you should make the patient sit on a ledge or table, and be standing as if walking.
And then you should stand on the patient's foot, and place your foot over what appears to be the joint, and then step on it with your foot with all your strength until it returns, and you see that it is already aligned and does not appear to protrude.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that holds the entire foot, which has two ends, and then strengthen it with decent and firm fasteners for three days; and then loosen it and let him rest from walking for several days, until he is strengthened and the reduction is assured.
Chapter XXXV
On the types of displacement that are caused by bruising, or fracture, or both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you engage in the treatment of that condition and the restoration of the patient, many times death occurs.
And for that reason, it is not appropriate to assume care of the patient unless one is wise in the art, with long experience, compassionate and merciful, patient, not reckless or presumptuous; and who uses at the beginning of treatments those medicines which remove apostemas cautiously only, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for that person from whom you hope for health rather than destruction, with relief from the illness, and in whom you see some hope. And then strive immediately to make a reduction of it at the beginning of the cause, before an apostema becomes hardened.
And then if the member returns as we wish, administer a treatment that softens the hardened apostema and treats the wound with one of the drying ointments that suits it.
And if there is dislocation with fracture and the satagial bones are separated, then you should pierce their endings, and do as we have said in simple illnesses previously in these places for those.
And guard and avoid according to your ability that which enters through the ways of fear as I have previously instructed you; for this is better for you, more pleasing to your Creator, more lasting to your glory, and more healthful for your true body in your time. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text: Amen translates to "so be it" or "truly." It is often used at the end of prayers as an expression of agreement with what has been said.
