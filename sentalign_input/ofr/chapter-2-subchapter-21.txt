of the rupture of the uvea
When a disruption occurs in the uvea, then it opens, and pus comes from the eyelids like a grain of resin, and it is frightening to see; then if you see fit to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper one, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear duct; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement; then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the uvea around it, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea on each side of a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great prominence, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches deep into the eye, and drain the albuginous humour and lower the eye, and enter it immediately; then drain it until it is healed.
