Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed this book for you, children, which is the last of the medical sciences with its complement, and having reached its end through its expositions and its own declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery, with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the practice of manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, quite private, until perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its trace has been severed, and nothing has remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions were closed, and its power was removed, it seemed to me that I should revive it by the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation, and to present the forms of cautery instruments and other operation instruments, with the addition of declarations and the haste required.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen described, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that reason Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, but with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy is not deterred from falling into an error by which people are killed, as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I saw a foolish physician incise a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who dared to remove a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he reached it and removed it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician, in his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and he remained like that until his leg and foot became an abscess and reached destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and there followed tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become firmly established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who perforated the cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until its evil increased with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because, when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgical operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation to which health is associated; and operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already aroused in every place of this book, in which operation comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to beware of it, and to cut it off, so that fools may not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take your measures with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading through God's grace to health and a praiseworthy succession: and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and ultimately to your rewards.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, arranged and ordained from head to foot, and the forms of instruments and cautery tools, and everything necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the whole arranged, ordered by forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: arranged and ordained from head to foot, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone, glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Albucasis's Surgical Book.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and for which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary for me to speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in which constitution it should be applied.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that discussion of the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on this topic, and they disagreed: and to me, a little from their words suffices, fearing length.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore, I say that cautery benefits every constitution, whether with matter or without matter, except for the two constitutions which are a hot constitution without matter and a dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed on the hot and dry constitution with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is helpful in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in a sickness that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable for a sickness from heat and dryness to be healed with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself, through his statement, say that experience has shown me this several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it should not be applied unless one is already proven and skilled in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has learned the diversity of human constitutions, and the nature of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their effects, and the duration of their course.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, there is no fear regarding the other constitutions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have already agreed on them, and have not disagreed concerning the help of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member that is cauterized, and does not harm another member joined with it, except by a small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches what is remote from the members, and perhaps causes an illness of difficult healing in the member, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	However, this has become known to us through experience, on account of the length of our service and study of the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and for this reason I am excused from the length of this discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to my book, I would bring forth to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it drives out illnesses with a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and they propose a better time for the verisimilar.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm, being accidental, is submerged in the benefit which is attracted with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater harm will occur than the small harm that transpires because of the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely, that the ailment cured by cautery does not always return.  And they posit that as a consequence, but the matter is not as they think.  Because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the humours which are the causes of why the pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its recovery, and the strength of its action, and the vehemence of its dominion.  And it is possible that the illness may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the ill person, and the location of his illness, and its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the gathering of superfluities in him, and what reaches him in his acquisition from foods and the like of such causes, unless it is a disease in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb, from few superfluities and moistures, like toothache, because of pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly, the common people's assertion that cautery is the final medicine is correct, not in what they intend by that, because they believe it is not a cure comparable to medicine, nor anything else after the cautery has subsided.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the final medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment in some illnesses, and those medicines are not successful, then we administer cautery at the end, and it does work; then it falls out that cautery is the final medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that the cautery site does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely so, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you are making a cautery in fire from gold, it is not clear to you when the fire is according to the quantity you want, because of the redness of the gold.  And when it hastens to cooling, and if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that occupation, and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, due to its suitability for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and arranged them from head to foot, so that they might alleviate the seeker who desires something from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization benefits against the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain, which two are causes of headache, and a multitude of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally, every illness that occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a cleansing, dissolving medicine, cleaning the head for three nights, or four, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands squared, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever, therefore, your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constricted, and you will revolve it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then raise your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with the iron itself, or with another from it if it grows cold, until the bones appear, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked cloth in butter, and leave it over the place, until the scab of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then that which is burned from the bone should be scraped off, then treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes an impression in the bone, such that the bone falls away, which happens like a kirate form, or an instrument that women use with a small alphabet infusion; and they believe that vapors from the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people, according to the path of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the infirm is naturally weak, and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it prolongs itself in the sick person, and they use leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of those things helps him, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters severe cold, then cauterize with another cautery under the first slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is not exposed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas*, which is the place where the cupping vessel is placed; and elevate your cautery here and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person experiences great pain because of that, different from the pain of the other cauterizations on all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this: The cautery should be in its proper place; and it should be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery than that used for the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment is administered, as I stated in the divisions of illnesses, and yet that does not provide a complete cure: then cauterization is performed in it in two ways: either with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, open the painful area at the time, with a wide lancet, until a place under the skin is made, where the clove is placed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into the place under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it above with a suitable constriction of lint, and leave it for fifteen hours; then release it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward, place on it a poultice soaked in butter until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery iron, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a "clavilus" because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron gradually with speed; and the amount that is burned should be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery below is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an ancient one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating hemicrania, along with what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have stated in the divisions of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, and you see from the illness that what we said of the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it whitens after you have marked the area of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or nearly that; and place your hand on one side, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest a spasm result.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and careful of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting is the danger, especially for the one who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not diligent nor skilled; and he abandons the operation in the first place.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for the flow of blood arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see, from the illness, that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we spoke of in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the other treatment that we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire; and it is that which is called the "Punctum," whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after its ignition, touch the points around the entire ear, as it revolves; or around each, if the pain is in both ears simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move the cautery a short distance away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and the amount of cauterization should be ten points in each ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a twisting motion.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The twisting that is treated with cauterization is only from the types that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of twisting with poultices, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment is of no benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted in three places: one near the root of the ear, a second somewhat lower from its time, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the upper extremity of the ear under the horn of the head a little, and another in the temple, whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of one from the knife, whose form was previously mentioned; however, it is not any thinner than a little, as you see, and it is necessary that the knife within it have a little superfluous thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of his head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of his head, according to what preceded; and the method of the cautery shall be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	A cautery is also applied to the mouth of the stomach; and this is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he should be treated with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the drink be given first to the sick large hyerae, and pills that cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is indeed the method of the cautery, and do it according to the same order that I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If, therefore, it is cured by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish an addition, and the weak man is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form which was stated before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back, and with three over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, in the sickness you need to soften the body with more than those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cautery until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Olive.

Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment which we have stated in the division, when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant of the taking of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle, and mastications that cleanse the brain, are administered, many days beforehand, along with a good dietary improvement.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterward cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded in the manner, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on each horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If however the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have described for someone with paralysis, and for the softening of the body over the spinal vertebrae of the neck and back, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method that has preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess sloping towards melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him in a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly crafted little roll of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the sick person, seated upright, should be held secure on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is best made from old sheep's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, such that a finger can tolerate it when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the sick person once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, beyond which you should hold the cauterizing instrument: indeed, let it be smelled.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs, which I have said in the division, then begin and let the weak one drink, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him from all dampness, and have him sit in a bath, fasting for some days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if there is the beginning of a descent of water in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is the beginning of water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be of such length as the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution from the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant, and are upon the veins and arteries that are in the manifest exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described in the inception of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it needs addition, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, upon the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; then hurry, and give the weakened one concoctions in drink for three nights; afterwards shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a claviform cautery, two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not put your hand with the cautery to the very end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of the cautery according to this method of lunate cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs grow inward, stinging the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in it according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cautery with fire, first advise the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is of those who clean them, until they are elongated and equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they sting him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and equal, then place the head of the sick person on your lap: then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a sign which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cot moistened in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape which you marked gradually in many turns, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely and properly burned.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then cauterize that place again, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	You should instruct the sick person to allow the hairs to drop out until they are elongated and even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from unabsorbed lime, each a weight of one ounce, or nearly so: then grind them together with good rubbing, and do it quickly, lest it cool.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take a piece of that, from it, over the paper that you made like the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or of two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white; and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the biting of the medicine, because its biting is found to be like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore this biting which he finds lasts, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised upon contraction with fire, or with an incision, it is good; and if not, then again apply medicine to the area where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the utmost guard, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something fights from the hairs into the eye, then again medicate that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, in accordance with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if your treatment does not help, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move nor shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cotum infused in the white of an egg, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand near the cautery, from the eye, to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not wander, or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a cloth with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If however forty days have passed, and it is not healed: then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the mouth is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in that fissure a fine camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachma's worth of melted lead, and hold your hand with the retention cannula well, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run, or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a poultice steeped in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nostril opening, and to redirect the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Fissures, called "pili", frequently occur in the lip, especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and if treatment is not effective, then apply a small knife cauterium to the wound, in this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place it, heated, onto the fissures themselves, until the cauterium reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a cauterant until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it produces pus and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then if you treat it and the treatment does not work, then it is necessary that you cauterize the cauterium according to the size that is in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce it [the cauterium] ignited into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its utmost point; do it once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If, therefore, the pus is separated and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then, using a cautery, whose form will come after this, place the cannula over the tooth: and quickly introduce the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire having already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let him spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to cold, either cold or a worm is in it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	Its cautery with butter is that you should take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a bit of cotton, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron upon it, until fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is to aim for a copper cannula, or an iron cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of its thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take a cautery, whose form shall be as follows, and place it upon that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do it a few times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you are able; and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Strophules.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Strophules are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and their digestion is slow; then cauterize with a concave cautery, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke may issue from the cautery from the other end; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if it does not suffice, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice steeped in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidities overcome the pulmonary passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the sick person be first evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the noxious place near the root of the throat in a depressed area; and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finishing it off; and let the cautery be narrow according to the method that went before.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what went before, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and disease of the lungs are from cold humours, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is long-standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in depressed, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form that went before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your desire is for cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to as if another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what went before, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do it with three cauteries in one turn.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not fix itself at the time of returning from its dislocation, until such time as it is accustomed to returning, and then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the sick person should be laid on their back, or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin which is in the inner Titillico towards the upper part with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having a cautery with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place upon the cautery bruised leeks with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then cause the sick person to adhere to stillness, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture happen in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and phlegms multiply in it, and constant methods of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the spoon-shaped part of the chest, the size of a finger, with a cautery-knife, and two cauteries below it, on either side of the first, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen them between each other so that they do not join, when they will cause pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, and let the cautery by which this is done be one according to the shape of a circle, according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for one who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as if you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity you wish with ink; then cauterize it with a cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When in the liver pain occurs from coldness and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion through the expulsion of superfluities, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this shape and this same quantity on the lower liver, from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches: and let the space that is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity that is burned be, in thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it, not added; and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware that you do not proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, so that the whole body is burned, and reaches the intestines; because the skin there is thin, so know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its covering: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the liver's covering, there is intense pain with sharpness: and you see already that the treatment has tired its physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the sick person should lie on their neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cauterium, which is made like a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it, one cauterium, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one should not use this type of cauterium unless their study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and by whose hands such illnesses have met with experience many times; then only may they dare on such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to abandon it, is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, a cauterium with aristolochia roots for a cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you receive from the dry long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, which is found from it, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil; and ignite it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping down on the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping slightly towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be in the evident skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron like a rod: and they ignite it, and insert it within that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and pus comes out: as we said in the case of an abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, in accordance with what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing lines along the length of the spleen, in the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the distance between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be the same as we described for the cautery of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand hard on the cautery: and let the infirm person lie supine on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we mentioned in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and raise the skin, which is directly above the spleen, where the left elbow of the sick person reaches; and let your elevation of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cautery after you allow it to emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the previous treatments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have stated in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and a cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and with one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be approximately equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the weak person from treatment after the cautery with him: because it is necessary that two intentions be united in him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a nail-like shape, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses appear in a hydrops patient, and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot, in the nocrati, which is between the auriculare and anulare [tendons/areas]; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then, make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like tip of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time so that some water will drain from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the case of abdominal distention.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the abdominal distention is due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of cure, but is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of great potency, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a fine, claw-like cautery; and a large cautery on the hypochondriac region, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubic bone, and a cautery on each buttock; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial cure, whose help does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, a little below the navel, in a triangular shape, and with a cautery under the navel, as if by two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food does not digest, and you see his face suppurate, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cautery blade: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, through which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more useful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-eight.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not respond to the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured by cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the extent to which the cautery entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder, or to the intestine, then guard yourself from all of these locations.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the area until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the area is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut away materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is within its depth, or something similar to that: whose mention will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold, or from heavy wind, and it lessens on account of that of the infirm person, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the almethen, over the kidneys themselves, cauterizing over each kidney with a clauili cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the same almedate.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur from cold and dampness, to the point where the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left: and let the length of that cauterization on each side be according to the size of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a cautery of the lower back, or with two cauteries, if that is needed; and let it be according to the preceding cautery's closure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and dampness occur in the uterus, and it is prevented from conception, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above and slightly below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors discharge into the anus, and become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of that is that one leg is prolonged over the other, when compared together; and the site of dislocation is found vacant in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink around the anus, as it revolves; and that the anus itself falls within the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the same form as that used in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to relieve the patient from the thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, cauterization is done in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore, there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one, so that there should be a circle containing the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, on the spot where the infirm person points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the ankle four fingers towards the wild part a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the infirm person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he points with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery so as to burn a nerve or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the infirm person bad harm, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in their cauterization, and the leg has become swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then the dissolution of the abdomen and death followed thereafter.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men said in cauterizing the hip, of which this is the method of cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or slightly less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about one knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-box of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in one turn.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, with this type of cautery, O children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who will wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is a good cautery for him who endures it, and finds its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cautery, however, with burning medicines, is that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends a gate hinge of it from bronze or iron, the length of a wall, whose height they may have two knots, or as if themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick man lying on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the box of ashes greatly.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour of time, and let the sick man tolerate its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire until the burning ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the hot water from the whole ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, according to what you did for the ash equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, both of one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced with one small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter: and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over more lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medicines with which the anus, also like the testicles, and honey of anacardium, and lime with soap, are cauterized, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the anus and sciatic vein were cured: and he greatly praised its effectiveness.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in a single instance, until he related that perhaps he had entered a bath carried and emerged from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragi: and if fresh is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and let it be ground much with a little fat, and placed on the anus, where there is pain, or the leg, or the thigh: and let it be bound, and let it be left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels the abatement of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, put him on a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary for someone to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who spoke of this, said that the dung of goats, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cauterization is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the lesser toe, and is closer to the lesser toe.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do this, until the feeling in the intervening space reaches the ankle, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cautery of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or from a blow, or from the evacuation of superfluities, and things similar to these, from the infusion of cold and damp matter: and indeed cautery does not apply, except in this single type, which is caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills and things similar, to be applied to the back where the pain is, three lines should be made according to the width of the patient's back.  After marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more according to the tolerance of the patient's strength, cauterization should be performed with a pointed cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medial, cleft cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of humpback.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in very young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that there is a constriction in their breathing during lifting and movement; and you find in the lowest thoracic vertebrae and their nodules that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery cover the entire part of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines of punctures, and let the punctures be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you administer the cautery to the hump that arises from a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are from cold humors that are poured out to any limb of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is to cauterize it after evacuation, in a circuit around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do so with a puncturing cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that happens often, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same clavi-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, more of this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said concerning the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If, however, the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the focus, like two lines revolving.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over each knot, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the sick person from good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is undertaken and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends to the testicle, and it is a beginning, close proximity: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to give up eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And that he use laxatives, so that feces descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture over the pubic bone, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form this is, until it comes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand over the location, so that the intestine does not escape: and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery upon that mark, your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or again with it another time, if you have not reached the mouth with it on the first try.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and that death or great harm does not come to the sick person through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not successful.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery for infants should be small, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide nourishment for the duration of his treatment, that will soothe his stomach, so that the intestine does not discharge during attempts at defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be lessened in labor, and in the repletion of food and drink, and in loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete recovery.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the remaining abdomen, and are incipient, and the strength is such that they should not be added to, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is cauterized be thus as a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it with what we said: and it will not be added to.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some early ones have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the key-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When in some limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one adjacent to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the diseased part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider that.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If the leprosy is obstinate, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has neither subsided nor ceased; and you fear that the corruption might spread throughout the entire constitution of the afflicted person: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the forehead, and a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two temples, and one behind at the base of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And hold your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it creates a small indentation in the opening, and the crusts are loosened; so that the expulsion of thick vapors from it may be eased, and cauterize the spleen with the cautery as previously mentioned.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	However, if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with the cauteries that we mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the tailbone and one on it, in the actual buttock; and with two on the hips; namely, one on each hip, and with two on the knees; one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the joints of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And the cauteries should be of various sizes, both large and small, according to the limbs and joints, in accordance with what has preceded concerning types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what is deserved by the magnitude or smallness of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery enter into the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain numbness which happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When the Albaras is old and no remedy from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize upon it itself with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its colour is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each one part: let these all be mixed, and applied to a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as if revolving.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, the learned have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturing, whether due to excess causing it, or due to the age of the infirm person, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or due to the time and need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from the one following the infirm person, so that the course of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a malignant corrosive.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing other than corruption in a limb that walks, and corrodes it; as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	Therefore, if you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then cauterize it many times with small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and apply ground sulfur with oil to the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh grows, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remained of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of more rapid help; and indeed I have already said that its cauterization with corroding medicine is in division; therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts and corns.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Often this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, make a concave cautery resembling a vulture's wing, to be made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the wart from every side, and have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, over the wart.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the wart until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster to it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is as if you take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's quill; and place it on the wart, or corn.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand steady, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the root of the wart, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the wart.  And let the sick person wait a little while on the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the wart is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each of them, one by one, until you reach all that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Trembling.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When trembling occurs in someone from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For trembling ceases with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of the cold illness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased; and the superfluity causing them is broken, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that is cut in a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cautery of a limb, and things similar to them: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is stopped beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and many larger ones, in the fire: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the bleeding is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it escapes when you lift your finger from the artery's opening, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and cause another harm to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or put on it medicines of properties, which are to cut off the blood, and be tied with a suitable constricting cushion.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He however who administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the placement of burning things, and similar things, does not benefit it completely, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however that should happen to someone, and a physician is not present for him, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not to be removed, over it with very cold, cold water constantly, until the blood is congealed, and thickened, and severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile let him consider in it what it needs from cautery, or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter that every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path: that the seeker may be relieved of his quest.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, children, that in this chapter there is a terror similar to that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, for in the operation that is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a passageway, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes in this art the ways of men come together with the ways of illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is one who is angered by his illness, and death is easy for him, because of the intensity of what he finds in his sickness and its prolonged malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is one who gives his payment, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication of that to which health may suitably be.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is your help concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, children, with his intellect, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter on Cauterization, from the neck up to the feet, so that your inquiry concerning it, and what you need, may be lightened.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightly compresses the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And truly I have not seen this illness in others than children, and death swiftly followed all whom I saw afflicted by it; therefore, it seemed to me fitting to omit treatment for it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw a child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if the treatment is for moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, with a width of one breadth, and the length of the incision should be about two spans, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture has increased more, and the abscess is larger, then place two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and that is not hidden from you: then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a poultice of wine and oil over it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound tightly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the sick person any dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and accumulation of water appear to you, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When cataracts occur in someone's eyes or chest, and it is prolonged and medicine does not help, then the final treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tighten his neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink each one: and cut each one with a lancet on each side, the incision reaching the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the lancet under the artery and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating outflow, which leaps to the interior with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a quantity of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink and split it until the mouth [opening].
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which is necessary to emit from the blood, is VI ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the weak person and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then constrict the wound with bandages made from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from a chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple muscles, or a severe, chronic ailment, and is treated with the usual methods of medicine and it does not help, then we are experienced in these illnesses in extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is that the infirm person should shave the hair that is in the temples, and direct the attention to the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it is indeed shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the severity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person hold their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply steam to the place with warm water, until it appears to you in a clear way.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I have made a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tissues that are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a portion from it according to the amount by which its ends will lengthen and contract, and so that no blood flow occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood will not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of alhohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur at the wound before it heals, and blood flow does not happen.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut off, and it will remain in the place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless if the sick person has a fever, or is of a heated temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is from those things that help in finishing humidities.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is a better aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary, after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old lint: and pads properly made be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the removal, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If meanwhile, during your work, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then quickly cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with zegi: and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of great coldness, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, the cold hastens both of them: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink: and place both of them heated strongly, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that the distance between its extremities is extended.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of persistent, acute tear flow from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from veins situated on the outer surface of the skull, and medicine with medicaments does not contribute to their cure, and you see the patient's face already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs of their rims are already corroded; and his eyelids are inflamed by the severity of the tears; then the ancients resorted to this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment, with a Knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you should instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead; and let the length of each incision be approximately two fingers; and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side; and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the size of three fingers joined together; and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which you may absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision; and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, with that which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, one side smooth, not sharp, on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision is continued up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a linen cloth made of old cotton, and place on top of them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligature, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain in the depths of the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these occurrences that those matters, and catarrhs, do not come except from numerous veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should command the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of his forehead, or another slightly wider one, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision reach to the bone: and withdraw your hand from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it from above with small pads: and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess may not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rosin: and prepare a plaster from them, and it is administered for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something from violet oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and make it sneeze with condiments, and occlude the nostrils at the coming of the sneeze, after you place around the ear fragments of cloths or wool, and extend the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often goes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not go out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, with thin pliers: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it goes out with the pliers, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a thin, single-hooked, slightly forked implement.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not go out by that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and plug that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often it goes out with that which we have related.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not go out this way, then take from helkalimbat, or from viscus, that is, prepared gluten, with which birds are caught, a small amount; and place it at the tip of the radius after you have wrapped a suitable bandage around it; then introduce it into the ear canal with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not go out with all that we have described, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that phlebotomize the weak first in the cephalic vein; and draw from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the infirm sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near his fat in a depressed area there: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the incision from your hour with speed, and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain, which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you have placed many small pieces; then extract them with hooks, or with a thin instrument, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thereby alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, in water that enters the ear, the afflicted person should first use sneezing; and he should fill his ear with some old cotton; and he should lie on the ear in which the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If, therefore, it comes out through it, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the afflicted person insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, let him not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now, when the water comes out, take one from papyrus or reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another reed, and do this many times, until all the water comes out; and extract it with a cannula, according to what was said previously concerning the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is small, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large size, apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all things that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this: narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it; then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this repeatedly, until all the worms emerge.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then coat the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already used in the killing of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your application of oils and medications into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wider at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze well-made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap linen at its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medication you desire, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the rod with the linen from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be warmed a little with fire; and beware that the substance which is distilled into it is not excessively cold; for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of accidental ear blockage.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it happens also to some people that the ear canal is blocked by a wound, or flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, and is not seen; and sometimes it happens near the outside of the canal, and is seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is seen, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose shape is as follows: the tip should have a small width, and a sharp edge; and the rest of the probe should have two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook, and cut it away with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If, therefore, you sense a blockage with the patient's impaired hearing, attempt its opening with ease, and beware lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then apply a bandage to the ear, according to the size of the opening, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a bandage, soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle ground zegi on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear has already suppurated, then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and apply another bandage wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and place it over the ear, and use the other treatment, which stops the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the eye lids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These swellings that occur in the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you must grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place a pounded astringent on the area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something happens in the eyelids that resembles granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation on them therefore is, that you should consider then, if it is a granulation progressing in that which appears on the eyelid, and they move in every direction, and its removal is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make a fissure over it, to the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it away from every side with ease, until it is removed.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If, however, the fissure is large, then gather it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granulation is sloping inwards towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid and suspend the granulation with a hook; besides that, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the granulation's incision, with salt water: and treat the place with that which makes it flesh, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the eyelashes.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it most often happens to children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because their tears rush to them, and because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on them. Their eyelids, which are already swollen, are damp beneath the eyebrows.  The prominence of the Axirnath is evident to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation is that the sick person should place their head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a string on it, and make a circle out of that string according to the amount that Axirnath contains on every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, incisions by the width, and let the incision not be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut through the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many positions the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and be careful not to add to the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision with ease, until the Axirnath comes forth.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among men are those who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that the remaining moisture may liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle in an improper manner.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When extra hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural lashes, and persist: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured by four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by canes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You should place the patient's head in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs, adding with a spatula proceeding from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark above the eyelid with ink, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it varies in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is one who needs that a large quantity be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what remains of thread over the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three or four days; afterwards treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment the ancients taught.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the infirm, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	However, if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation: and raise the skin over which the sign is placed, as we have recounted.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with caeroto, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, that its hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, it is necessary that you use what we have said concerning the incision: but suturing is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is necessary to turn the eyelid, and to cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the spatula; and you have now incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully apply each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The procedure in it is that you should take a slender needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot at each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread under it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be clear; for it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up over the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the alinxotati is pulled out and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then you shall pull the alinxotati and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it; or leave it until it lengthens after a period, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, the accidental one arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place on that which is between them a linen lint, and tie it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay; and embrocate with water in which althea, flaxseed, have been cooked; and with the unguent dyaquilon, liquefied with some oil; and wrap with it a linen lint, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is to try with all ingenuity that it does not consolidate, according to the form it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have stated is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental kind is caused by a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things similar to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is to take a needle, on which a double thread is fastened, and to pierce it into the flesh, and to cause it to penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rod, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is formed from them: until, when they come together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines, and poultices, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a poultice, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it has many varieties of form, and a prudent craftsman prepares an approach with whatever method is possible to him, until he makes the shape return to its natural form, or near it, and the afflicted person himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not have the sharpness of other spatulas, but rather be slightly blunt, so the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not injure the eye with its sharpness.  Your incision should be as if you were gently peeling away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distill it into it from a vessel made of dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with flax thread; and place on the eye wool soaked with egg white; and after three days use the vessel, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous and is similar to hard, fine skin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed and the hook does not become fixed in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, until it proceeds gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a few-fold hook, and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you saw it with the hair up to its furthest point.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a continual flow of tears does not result from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with only a hook, or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny coat, and that a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a concoction made from ziniar, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fastened to it, then this type of nail is frequently treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a thin, gentle, blunt spatula, of this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with care.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming thin and breaking, and the shaving imprints on it, then drop from your hour-glass into the eye a sieve made from ziniar, or a red sieve, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation upon it, until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, in which case leave it alone, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with the knife, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	If, however, a fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes great harm to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away; and do not complete the incision so that the flow of tears is not impeded.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the tear duct a red salve, or one made from ziniari, until healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some people, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or clings to the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rose's bud.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the treatment for it is also that the sick person should lay his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect that entire flesh with suitable hooks for that: and hold it with one forceps, or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until its whole is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, as we have described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asbel is collected, according to its form which will follow this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When, therefore, your incision is completed, and the whole alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines; and place over the outside of the eye a cloth with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with added flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid treating every weak eye by a natural or accidental route, operating with iron; and do not insert your hand in any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and impede the eye's function of sight; and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the sebel is present is strong, and there is no other ailment in it besides the sebel; then collect the sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a slender double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine scissors with precision, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are dissolved; and beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red juice, so that its sharpness will corrode whatever remains of the scab.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides, and it is secure from a hot abscess; then again upon it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the Arissati fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to its preceding description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it, unless you cut open the abscess near its origin and extract all the moisture and pus from it until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called an Asperi head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which is pointed with the filing of a file, or with a fine-pointed aliskilferi, and place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand for a short time, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident occurs in it, then you know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you detect the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is detected, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular, and its wood be a tapering pyramid to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; through this, that they find air escaping from it, when they hold their hand over their nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing outward returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter on the sick person.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs to the vision, then you should release the patient, then bleed him, and afterward place cupping vessels on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bandage the eye from above over the plaster with many small bandages.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the bandages is: that you should take many soft cloths, and each cloth should be doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one over the other, according to the amount needed for the eye; then bind them over with a hard cloth using a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again apply cupping vessels with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping vessels, and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the tunic of the uvea, this is good; and if not, then apply again the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and cupping vessels, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the appearance of the person because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the procedure for it is, as I describe: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle on which is a double thread from the lacrimal side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle; and tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place on the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a bandage, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or stand upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take its head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be released: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it did not descend further, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a sharp spatula, and with it split the cornea slightly near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the edge, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing is declared and explained in speech; then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary to make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly bind it; then the eyelid of the eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the extremity of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the lesser tear-duct in the white of the eye; then propel the almagda with force; and you turn your hand with it until it penetrates the white of the eye; and feel that the almagda has now reached the empty thing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagda up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almagda exits.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almagda with ease, and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some of clear gem-salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye all the lint or wool soaked in rose oil and the white of an egg, and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place on it crushed cumin with the white of an egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from men, whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva, and do not place your hand in the hole; and there is nothing other than to make a way for the almagda to its place subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a properly made bedroom, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and forbid him all movements, and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and do not let him move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it in that dark house, and test his vision; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to remove it; because water ascends quickly through violent looking.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed. Then, restore its vision, and place over its face an oral thing by which its vision is governed for a few days, him being in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him leave the house gradually and walk around in his own houses.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in a zaltea, a student is not excused from the vision some times; for then let him dare on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach a perforated magdan was made, by which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed I have seen no one in your land who has done that, nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of air properly, and let their extremities be triangular with the same subtlety, and pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various fleshy growths arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many legs, and among them is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and there is also flesh that is soft, not dark-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In those fleshy growths that are soft, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, you should have the infirm person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh; then pull it outward, and cut what you have grasped from it with a sharp, slender spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remained from that which cannot be removed: then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to introduce a linen thread of some thickness, and make many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick man cause one end of the thread to enter the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him, after he has made it similar to an azire; and let him pull his odor, until it reaches the cause, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And often indeed children do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy matter for him who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread, and after cleaning the blood, place in the nose a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead cannula at the end of the object in the nose for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that will dry it, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a seashell, and its passageway similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And let the seashell instrument for making a nasal douche be full, uncovered; let it have a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and flowing substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart arises at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and remove the whole of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place upon the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that he who incises a man's abscess, and great harm comes from it to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear; and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from surgery, except in some individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then join the wound edges with suture, and thereafter treat it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separated edges of the break in continuity are already sound, then it is necessary to scrape away all parts from their apparent skin until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two edges with sutures, and tighten them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and powdered frankincense on it; and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads are cut away by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is to bring together the break in continuity either with needles, as we have described in abdominal suturing, or to bring it together with thread, as I have caused you to know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people frequently have hard abscesses like plant seeds inside their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary to turn the lip over, and to incise over each nodule on it, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of flesh grown upon the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows upon the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place upon the place pounded zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron tool.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, and greenish crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inner and outer, and between the gums, until the corruption from it reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly due to it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should place the weak person between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see the crusts, and a substance resembling sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If, therefore, that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally your effort reaches what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, many forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation; for the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of scrapers be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You must treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that will replace its function when it is extracted, because it is a superior substance; until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to extract it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks it is in the tooth itself and extracts it; afterwards the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there should be some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you carefully make the scarification around the gum on every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person with that greater malice which is greater pain to him at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in its eradication, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are harder to break, and its roots all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some of the zegi, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the delicate forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you grip them, they do not yield or double; with short extremities, and made of tempered iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities should be teeth, some of which fit into others, and grip with a proper, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the removal of a tooth that breaks, something remains, then it is necessary to apply ointment with butter to the place for one or two days, until the place softens; then introduce a drill or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	However, this is the shape of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully work upon the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in extremity, somewhat thick, and not be soaked so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular in extremity, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also, help is given with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the description of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also, there is assistance with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form: triangular extremity twisted, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break, and may not be absorbed.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments for teeth are many, and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and the skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to which the operation and the ailments themselves indicate to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are ailments for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies, then examine it in its place with what is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps that I have described in the extraction of roots, and assist with a forceps, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be grasped, or held with it, and may not escape and go away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with remedies appropriate to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the sawing of teeth that project above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a foul form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born behind another tooth, and is not positioned correctly, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then remove it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, which has this shape.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole thing be of tempered iron, and its handle of small points very fine, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then smooth it, and finally scrape it with some scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If, however, it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even; and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling out; and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has been unsuccessful; then it is expedient that they be bound with gold wire; because silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of a medium thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of retention is this: take a wire, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving to the point from which you began; and tighten your hand with care and wisdom until it is firmly fixed; and let your tightening of the wire be close to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together, and turn them over with forceps; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be so tight that it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it comes loose or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will remain fixed in that way throughout the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth, and the way of retention of two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after falling out, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and no one but a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the gap, from which the tooth is reinforced and tightened, as we said: and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Of the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the sick person on his head in your presence, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament along its breadth, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and if it is from the consolidation of a wound, then insert a hook into it and split it along its breadth, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and a flow of blood result.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the area of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen bandage, which the patient should hold all night, so that it does not consolidate a second time.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then place crushed zegi over the area.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess forms under the tongue, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth in the presence of sunlight and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If, therefore, you see it to be dark, or black, hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is tending towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt, and care for it with the appropriate remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, glands which resemble almonds, which occur externally, and are called the two tonsils; which, when you treat them with what we have stated in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark colour, with little sensitivity, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the procedure in it is that you should consider before its operation if its abscess has settled down completely in quiet warmth, or is reduced by some lessening.  Then, therefore, make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your bosom.  And open his mouth, and let an attendant take it between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outward as far as you can, except for what you pull out with it from the tissues.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is this that follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other sharply: hence, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or of soaked alfuled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranates' peels have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood is cut off: then care for him, until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut those according to what I have said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, with little sensation, which had almost entirely closed her throat: and the woman was breathing with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her to eat and drink water: and she had already arrived at death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore, I hastened, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed from it; therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time; and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I cut, until it was prolonged too much along with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore, it stood still from further additions; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has rested from it, and it is subtle; then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brownish or black color, and has no sensation; then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the way I described from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit in front of the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the description came before; then fix a hook in the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use what we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the sick person is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear or panic.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and is, that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of the bowl of a spoon's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the sick person lie on their side, so that saliva runs from their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it into their throat and harms them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you shall keep it upon the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine has settled.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take the spittle, and wrap it around the extremity of the spoon, and pour the spittle with the medicine, and introduce the spoon with the spittle into the cannula from above, until the spittle adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do it many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the area around the uvula with a cloth soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine, and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from danger than incision.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than a cautery or incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be well plastered with mud: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze, and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula above the tube, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually increases the abscess, and you ought not to do it except at the decline of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument is not present for you, then take a tube and place a layer of egg white at its end, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned, because the egg white prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from a good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them, upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the stomach weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will exit through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and it is extracted, then it exits.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not exit with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a Radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which let him introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that coughing does not befall him, and let him push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that which the infirm introduce, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of the leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and does not work, then consider in the throat of the infirm in the sun, or by the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps skillfully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with those, then take a concave cannula, and introduce it into the throat of the infirm, up to near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times; and let the infirm abstain from water the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	However, if it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the infirm person with leeches, or with asa with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live pruners with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole; and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then project the fumigation, and let the infirm person place his mouth on the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not emerge, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the infirm person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls upon itself as seen.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see; except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of various types, according to the way in which they are recalled, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of abscess within itself, and that which it comprises from humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy part is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses are those that should not be opened, unless after the maturation of the pus within them and its completion; and among them are those which must be opened while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that are close to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is a cause more proximate to the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a main limb: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore open it unripe; and it is not necessary to open a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time for the incision of a mature abscess according to its completion: and it is by the abatement of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess head; and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower part of the abscess, and of greater prominence: and let the incision be along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the incision along that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it will be prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised across the width of the body, according to necessity; or along the one which the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary, that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses; or many incisions by the likeness of the abscess's magnitude.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin; and to incise when it has already become like a cloth, and has reached a point where it is already dead; as that which happens in many, such as boils, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a portion of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then close the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something more of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to a gradual process, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly frail person: for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the animal with the exit of the pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply strips of linen or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and the perforations are numerous, it is then necessary that you insert a strip into each fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have excised a portion of skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with flax lint without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them, and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in detail.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is during wintertime, and the location of the abscess is full of nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse small pillows with warm wine and oil, and place them on the affected areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it be in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place small pillows soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make the whole thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until, when the third day shall arrive, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its treatment what is appropriate, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, then, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Following the path of distinction, however, I have already discussed every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in a chapter by chapter, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the type of Nodes, which are contained by membranes, which are like sacks around them; as if they were a hen's poultices.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their types are numerous.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like fritters and gruels; and similar to these; and some are hard, stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, provided that the incision does not encounter a contrary artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure for their incision is to test them with an instrument, whose shape comes after this, called the Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst containing the moisture, and leave nothing of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian unguent, if present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the unguent a second, a third, and as many times as necessary until you are sure no part of the cyst remains.  Then treat the wound with the unguent until healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and place hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however an artery resists you, then do that which I will tell you afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are in the head in some men, in which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found an abscess like a solid, hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if someone struck it with something, it would wound the person.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, apart from those abscesses occurring on the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is alleviated downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is appropriate for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of goiters on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Often these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those that arise from them on the neck, there are single ones and many; and they generate from each other; and every goiter from them is within its own tunic, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the varieties of these goiters are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And some of them are stony; and some contain moisture; and some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in any such one that you see, by touch, of good disposition, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, nor is deep: you should excise it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b to line, g, and scrape it from every side; and stretch the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said regarding abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution not to cut a vein or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put pounded zegi into the wound, or some powders which stop bleeding, and compress the wound and leave it, until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the bleeding is stopped then, therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, investigate with your index finger if any remains of other small scabs: therefore cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the root of the scab, then it is necessary not to cut that scab from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire scab is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and to suture it immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the scab, then it is necessary to attempt to cut its root and remove it, and apply the suture we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever humours the scabs contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its site of maturity; and place the puncture from that which is next beneath the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the puncture, apply liniments with ointments, and similar things to them, so as to corrode whatever remains of corruption, until when you see that the wound is now cleansed; then treat it with a generative flesh ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this incision into the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the writing of their discourse.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those suffering from angina, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit results from it; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the channel, one should use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the danger that comes from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis below three or four rings of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width, in that which is between two rings, to an extent that the incision is in the synovia, not in the cartilage; and this place is indeed suitable for the incision, since it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should split the skin, until when he reaches the channel; he should avoid any blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the synovia, as we have described: and it is indicated, on the incision of the channel, by the phlegm that flows from it, with what is broken and with the severance of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time in which suffocation is feared passes, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and sew it together alone, without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse we have recounted is not applicable except when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the patient's throat; and the patient is raised above death, and his breath wants to be cut off; they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, or something like that; then, therefore, they ordered the wound to be sewn up and cared for until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself is that a maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it cut a portion of the lung's passage.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore I probed the wound, and found blood which had flowed out of the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I concluded that she had not severed a vein, nor an artery; and wind was issuing from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore I hastened and treated the wound, until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the section of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural one, there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an abscess formed from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it should not be presumed to be attacked with iron, unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it as tumors are cut: and extract it with that which contains it from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then investigate its entire extent.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is necessary from the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision on the species of Tumors.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, with a tumor, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains sacs (or pockets) called sifachin, which are a distinct pouch, and are according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha (or a particular type of bean), larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you arrive at treating a tumor, it is necessary to examine it, and first inquire into its form with an instrument called an Intromissum, as its form will be shown in the chapter after this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating all abscesses and tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest spot you find within the abscess; and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand over the abscess according to its size.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which issues forth in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, a flowing moisture, of whatever color, issues forth: then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said concerning other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture issues forth in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore, cut above it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from every side easily; and keep the cyst, if you can, above it, so that you extract the sound one with the tumor.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	However, if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything small or large remains of it, the tumor returns mostly.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, it overcomes you, and a little remains of it, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place upon it that which sits the warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining cure until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the tumor is large, then suture its two lips, and treat it with that which causes healing.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a pulsating vein or one that is not pulsating, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood ceases. Then return to cutting that which remains of the tumor.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of instruments, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of iron, with squared ends, fitting well, so that they may quickly enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for probing abscesses, and openings, and fistulas, and buboes, from that which is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, sharp, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citrine, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made of citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And also made of black lead, which are suitable for probing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their smoothness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some of them are long, some of them medium, and some of them short, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of Hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped away: and they are of three kinds: because from among them is a large, medium, and small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are blunt: and they are not positioned thus, unless that with them help is given in scraping knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person might be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning which he finds when scraping an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are large ones, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to a rod, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end a hidden spatula point is located: and in it runs inward and outward when one wishes, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and let them be of fine quality.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood with speed in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the forearms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groins, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small instruments are made from them, similar to hazelnuts, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made from them, round, according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to become defiled in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain foul-looking, suppurating.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with a healing medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to make an incision on its two upper sides, with two incisions similar in shape to a crescent, each of which is contained within the other at the extremities of each, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision that you should make, because of the patient's distress or because of blood flow, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the armpit, are of the types of hard Strophulae, containing cysts, and some contain moistnesses.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those of them that contain moistnesses must be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, according to this shape, from line b. to line g. When, therefore, everything that is in the abscess from the pus is evacuated, then fill it with old cotton, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cotton should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment for it, until healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type of knotted Strophulae, then cut upon it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends in this, so as to emit pus, then administer a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts and the skin above it consolidates, then very often an abscess results from this; and similarly, a vein, too, may have an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round on the outward part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should also be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, for that which is from them, from the swelling of the artery's opening, make a cut in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from its tunics, until it is uncovered.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it be an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what you are able of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let a double thread be in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the grapevine ligature, with two ends of the thread on two sides.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If, however, you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside it emerges; then cut the excess skin, and let what is tied from it go.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment with bandages and ointments until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them by blows, or by excessive exertion, and the like; and it occurs most often in the places of the tendons, or the heel, and in every place where joints move; and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases without pain; and when it is pressed with force, the sick person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated, collected abscess, but rather beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forwards, or before, nor backwards, to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will result.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, in that which is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If, therefore, it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it away from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people frequently have growths in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small, and some of them become very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly were two growths that were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots, and their lips turned inward, and they split open, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found one to weigh approximately ten and eight ounces, and the other approximately six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is that, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with slender roots, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries in the fire present.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient fearful and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead, properly fashioned, and bind the ulcer with it: using the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead bandage.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to bind the lead, whenever it presses on the ulcer, until it is severed and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the ulcer is large in its root, then in its incision there is some fear and terror: especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut an ulcer that is dark-colored, with little feeling, and of foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Of the treatment of the navel eminence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel eminence arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures in the skin above the abdomen; and from it protrudes air, or an intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constriction of air within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is because of a fissure in the skin, and an exit of pus, then it is the colour of an abscess similar to the colour of the body; and it is smooth, without pain; and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the emergence of an intestine, then its location, with the variety we have described, is more severe.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it enlarges greatly at the entrance of the bath, and with strenuous exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is because of moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If however it is because of blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black to the eye.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to generated flesh: then it is a severe, large, hard abscess, and fixed according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or wind: then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine, or wind: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to hold his breath and stand extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, order him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel over the place you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind it around firmly with thread, or with a silk cord or firm ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be tied.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess stretched above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already caught by the ligature, then remove the ligature, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the artery or vein is opposite you, then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles around the circumference you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you cause to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefied.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the swelling of the navel is from flesh growing in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with whatever consolidates the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how is the way to cure it with medicines; and caution is to be observed in its cure with iron, so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and the precautions to take in its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible; such as Cancer which is in the nipples, or in the thigh, and similar parts, by removing the whole of it from the limbs; especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it is longstanding and large, it is not appropriate to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself could not heal anyone from it; nor did I see anyone before me who attained it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation for it, when it is located as we said, is to proceed and to relieve the sick person from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomize it if you find it with manifest fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with the preparation, in which he/she will be placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply hooks that fit to the Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and allow the blood to run, and do not cut it quickly, rather squeeze the places and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery, or vein, is causing you difficulty, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already narrated in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the species of tympanites: nor in the species of hyposarca completely: for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or loosening of the belly, and things similar to them, then beware of treating him with iron, because there is fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, propelling the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a thorny spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with sharp extremities like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be something of shortness gradually in it, so that you do not proceed with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you proceed with the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate with an instrument the entire skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and elevate your hand with the Spatula between the skin, and do so, as if you were to scrape it; and let the quantity scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then perforate, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty place, and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; on whose lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the tip of it is cut, according to the incision of a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour by the resolution of his animal spirit, or a syncope occurs to him that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you by the virtue of his pulse, and by his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening that is over the sifac: of which I spoke, that you should pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then again apply the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerate it: and extract also a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains only a little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you fear for the sick person and you remove much water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, and the liver, and the spleen, after the removal of water, according to what I have previously stated.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants born in places where their urinary passages are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its scrotum is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to help by perforating it immediately when it is born, with a very fine spatula, in this way.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a small leaden pin in the opening and bind it; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When, therefore, it wants to urinate, let it be removed, and let it urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which enters over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: wherefore it cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis upwards with his hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in him is that the sick person is laid on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans, with a sharp scalpel, or a sharp spatumil, just as one cuts a reed, or as you scrape something off, so that its middle comes forth like the head of the penis; and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it what cuts off the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning matters that occur in the foreskin and head of the penis, and concerning corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albather frequently occur in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it some are malignant, and others not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off until you have cleansed the whole of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent on it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with the unguent dyafinicon, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and a part of the Albather is within the foreskin, and a part of it outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather, which is inside first, until when it is consolidated, then treat the outer part: because when you treat both simultaneously, the foreskin is not protected from being pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And such things also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, with blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to corrupt, or is already corrupt.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it with honey, which has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and ground, sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely, for a flow of blood, and for a wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the patient may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these things accurately, then it is necessary to scrape a bit from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may perhaps be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat with astringent wine, until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, our will, and its use is specifically in boys, it is necessary that we delineate a better operation and a more gentle path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say that the ancients did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found most artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, by cutting with a razor and with scissors, and they use cauterization and tying with thread, and incision with a fingernail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; thus, it is forced to an incision to cut the other, and the resulting pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing done with cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a lancet, perhaps the iron slips away, and spoils your operation: and the skin of the boy is of short nature, and many times they are born thus, that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors, and ligation with thread, has revealed a good experiment to me: because scissors are proportional to the incision: because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar shape is made, encompassing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the manner of the proper operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is of those who understand a little, to consider that you do not do anything but tie a thread to his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you, from what his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it of the dirt that collects on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie a second ligature slightly below that.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the area of the lower ligature with a firm grip, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin quickly upwards and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for this is better), and place powder on top; and on top of the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and meet; so that a nail's branch does not emerge from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles taken together.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error, however, occurring in the cleansing is: that perhaps the inner skin escapes entirely, or part of it, near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it out from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place; and cut it along its equal parts.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it, until the abscess is mature, and open it with ease, and cut it as prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper regions, it will not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with that which we said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growing flesh, and similar things to those that we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	This causes the stone in the neck of the bladder to be expelled backwards, therefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, called a syringe, whose form is this: it should be of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in thinness, and the length of one and a half palms; to which there should be a thin tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you should take a doubled thread, and tie wool, or tow, a good ligature, to its extremity; and insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool is superfluous, but insert into the tube with force, like a lever.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and have the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upwards from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person feels it has reached the empty space; and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage in which it goes is tortuous.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urinary way; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood is congealed in it, or pus is collected in it, and it is desired to instill water and medicines into it, then it should be done with the instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow space, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the quantity that will fill it without addition, until when something is drawn along with it, the humidities are drawn out; and when it is propelled, it expels along with it something to a distance: in accordance with what the clepsydra does, by which naphta, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you wish to project humidities into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the humidity, and draw up with that which propels it to the upper part, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the tube, according to what we have narrated about the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the humidity with that which propels it, for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	A subtle form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass; its head should be higher, similar to a small alcama, and below it a sinus, into which a ligament should fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and place in it the humidity with which you wish to clyster the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature made of double thread; and heat that humidity for a short time over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the clyster into the tube, afterwards hold your hand over the bladder with the humidity with a proper constriction, until the sick person feels that the humidity has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then assemble the circle, as a saucer is assembled; after you have placed in it what you wish of the humors, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument; and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed the division of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs thereof: and I have described the stone in which manual operation and incision are appropriate; and this is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am explaining it with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it, and the weak man rubs his urethra, and labors with it, and often hangs (from pain).
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises, and the anus issues with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy for children, so long as they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those two: and the cure is easier for one whose stone is larger; and if small, the cure is conversely difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will expel all the waste matter that is in their intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken up by their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladder, or leaps from a high place sometimes.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a full youth; and insert it into his anus, and inquire about the stone, until it stands under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you wish; and order the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and order another minister to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand to remove the skin, which is under the testicles, in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatula, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, on the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to exit from it no larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, presses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone are angles and edges, wherefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	To that, therefore, which has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary that you devise something above it: or that you bind over it with a suitable instrument, whose tip is like the Moon, which binds over the stone and does not slip from it: or that you introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stone is more than one, then propel the largest first to the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, propel the small one after that; and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If however it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For if one of two things happens to the sick person, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him, because the place is not wholly consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or devise means to fracture it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess might subside.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person on his back, upon his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment dyafinicon and the ointment basilicon, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot abscess, and corrosive matter, and similar things, happen added to the wound: just as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from issuing from it: and that is known from the outflow of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply any sort of treatment with what is suitable for healing, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the whole period of treatment, that you bind the two hips, and the buttocks, for the sake of the medicaments that are placed on the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If there is a small stone, and it is in the urethra, and is fixed in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have narrated before you reach the stage of cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For very often you will be spared from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is necessary that you take a trocar of iron, whose shape is this: triangular at the end, pointed, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread and tie the urethra below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra easily, until the trocar reaches the stone itself: and rotate the trocar with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer side of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it [the stone] breaks and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread beneath the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the urethra itself, between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And a ligature of thread beneath the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you to raise the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Little stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If, however, a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden because of many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If, however, you trust her, then seek a chaste, skilled physician, and present a female midwife well versed in women's matters, or a woman who in this art hints at part of the art: therefore, make her present, and especially to her, let her do everything you command her regarding the investigation of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she should grasp it with her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak woman's vagina, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she move it gradually from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she brings it to the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she shall cut upon it at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger shall not be removed from the stone, grasping it beneath: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she shall insert a rod upon that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then she shall add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the species of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, know its species, so that this may be signified to you concerning that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place ground zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges: and do, that you prepare yourself with the instruments, which I said in the extraction of stones in men, that you may assist by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with ligatures in a fitting constriction: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision of an aqueous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	An aqueous hydrocele is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in a white substance, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the testicle: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it becomes putrid: which is another testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we have mentioned: and that does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hydrocele indeed is from the weakness that happens to the testicles; wherefore this material is poured onto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its colour is inclining to yellowness, or it is bloody red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac which we have said, then the abscess is round to a little length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in the pannicle proper to itself, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and therefore a man estimates that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge of that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When, therefore, we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to be bled if possible to him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him be laid on his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the scrotum skin, and to the part of the abdominal wall.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula and cut the scrotal skin from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubic bone: and let the incision be according to the straight equidistant line that divides the scrotal skin, until it reaches the white membrane containing it: and scrape it and observe, or beware of this, that you dissect it: and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the egg more: and subtly examine with your scraping as much as possible to you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the water-filled membrane with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the membrane upwards, and do not touch the scrotal skin encompassing it: and cut the membrane however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its entirety or in pieces, especially its delicate side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not meticulously examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	However, if the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the membrane, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the scrotal skin with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If, however, you find a black, corrupted egg, then you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterward treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part in the same way you did the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterward wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the lower abdomen; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows; and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sew them, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the extremities with which it is pressed be made of cotton, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a tightening band at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one extremity take hold above the anus up to the back, and the second take hold to the side of the pubic area; and two extremities over the two thighs below, and two other extremities over the two groins, and let the entire tightening band be gathered at the lumbar region of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the incision site with an iron. And it is that you should take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it should be heated, as we have described; until when a white, water-containing substance is exposed, then take the cautery according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is similar to a Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with it, and it should be heated until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you remove all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful, from the egg, that the fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, something adverse happens to you during the time of the section, or a hot abscess, or a flow of blood, or anything else, during the cautery: then you ought to treat whatever adversity befalls you from it with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as was previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then administer the perforation as I describe it: and so it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice over the area, and bind it, and allow it to run off the remaining water; then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the egress of water at the time you pierce it, and this is only because a white cloth causes resistance at the wound's opening and prevents the exit of water, then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose shape has preceded, or add a little to the wound's operation.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and gathers after six months, or approximately that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it gathers, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision upon this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many cases.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its removal is a saving from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is formed from the knotting of arteries and their inflation; just as its remembrance has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which is from them by the inflation of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which is formed from the inflation of veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is now possible that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the remaining flesh; and it is as if the skin of the testicles is separated.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upward, and pull it out with the white sifach; and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and pull out the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitis is an abscess enveloped by some wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and difficult movement and exercise, and walking, result in the sufferer.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which preceded it, recalling.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary, as we say, that the operation be performed on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspensory of the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels which are close to the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and stretch them with a vigorous extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, insert a needle with doubled thread into them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur, and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle, straight, along the length of the body, and extract that which is aggregated from the putrid, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no evil through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary to remove the testicles with the vessels because the egg will not receive nourishment due to the incision, and will wither or dry up, and will be of no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this colic is from a section that occurs in the extended sifach over the abdomen in the groin area from the abdominal mirach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a cry, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in depth, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from a section of the sifach, because it causes a sudden, violent pain from the outset: and the abscess is different, appearing beneath the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called a Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and this is harmful to the sick person, because it causes a dull pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, one must beware of falling into it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their own hand into the interior cavity, if it obeys the withdrawal.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them, and let the incision be according to the amount, so that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the siphak, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed from every side. Then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and sever with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand, and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision, and order the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and you sever the adhesion which is behind, completing the severance.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything of it, then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen consisting of ten threads, and insert it near the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is beneath the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then place some of them over others in a cross-like shape, and bind them with the alsifach, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a firm ligature, until no blood vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess does not occur from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by no more than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, leave from the siphak, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely along the circumference, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, the incision from which blood and pus runs, as we have described in what was previously said.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligature that we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water: and put on it what we have said, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the windy Ramus.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this Ramus I have not seen anyone who dared to use an iron for its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said that it happens as we have recounted in the Ramus which is with the Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon them with ease from below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with that which opens it itself, until the vessels fall out; and treat the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the inguinal region.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area bulges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if anything descends, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if the time with it is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is because the scrotum stretches; then the area softens, and becomes an abscess, and bulges.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding account stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is so that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the ulcerated and bulging area of the rupture, with a cut across, to the width of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the scrotum and what is under the skin until the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding area of the scrotum, and press it into the depths of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding areas on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal worms.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the thread, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it consolidates.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the scrotum contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place, since it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them softens, and its appearance becomes ugly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to have the sick man lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then, he should bring together the two folds with sutures; and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the stitches firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the remaining wounds with care, until they are healed and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and because of that, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine.  And its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, and so that he knows the treatment of whoever has suffered it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by rubbing, the method of operation is: that we should place the animal in warm water until its testicles soften and loosen, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer visible to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by splitting and cutting, you should hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut over each testicle with one cut, until when two testicles are exposed; then cut them after you have flayed both, and do not leave anything over them except a thin sifak, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by rubbing, because rubbing perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that a space appears in it, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hairs; and sometimes urine runs from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one kind, and it is a woman's vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outwards; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind, however, of men, from which urine issues, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Tentigo perhaps arises from a natural condition, until it is disfigured and its appearance becomes unsightly; and sometimes in certain women it becomes so large that it expands, as in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should grasp the excess of the tentigo with your hand or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not be overly hasty in the incision, especially into the deep root, so as to avoid a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that arises is flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges outward, in the likeness of a tail; and because of that, some of the ancients call the illness "tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut tentigo, and to treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, so that it is the vulva of a woman not perforated, or is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and indeed it is made either from added flesh that grew, or a subtle, or thick sifach: and it is made either in the deep of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or its lower part: and it hinders from intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it hinders menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its knowledge is made by the examination of the midwife, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is close to the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place cushions upon the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be upon her back with her legs spread out.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then spread the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it upon the place: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place will not consolidate again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it away with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then continue with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh births occur in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut in this manner: since it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, no opposition should be made with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins, until much blood runs from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already mentioned their species and signs in the division; and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which the sense falls, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that you admit the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then, powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powdered incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then, let him/her press his/her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, therefore, blood is drawn out with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and armpits, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the affected area.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess therefore subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you must cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the exit which occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, carbuncle, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already spoken of all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary to speak in this treatise of the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its inception is acute with its striking, and heat, and fever, and you see it to redden: if sensibility falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and she should recline, or be propped up on her back, and she should bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and her thighs should be spread apart, and she should put her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those which are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep into the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and injures the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pads over the covering of the womb's depth, so that the entire instrument's entry into the womb's depth is prevented; and it is necessary that it put a pivot, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side, and that the instrument be held, and that the attendant turn the pivot until the womb's depth is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by the hand, and is soft and gentle, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the linen cloth, and extract the section into the womb's depth.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the womb, and over the vulva, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root, or long aristolochia, has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inwardly in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, indeed treat it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	On the teachings of Midwives, how living embryos are to be treated, having emerged from the womb in a non-natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of natural childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs, when you see a woman pressing downward, and she desires to smell the air, and relief is upon her from that which is upon her concerning childbirth, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and its exit is above her head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, any birth beyond this one is unnatural, and blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one foot; or its head and hands emerge; or the belly emerges; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar, blameworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form from among them, and how the nature is in it, and what is signified by it, and how to stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural exit, and it becomes forceful upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened, then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her, and vaporize her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it flows out from the moisture; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be enemated with fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her, after the enema, to bear down; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If the first parts of two hands of the fetus emerge, it is necessary that you gently and gradually draw them back.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not yield at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then to turn the fetus gradually; afterwards to equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command that it be compressed, and make it sneeze with application; for it will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then bring back the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then emerge with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is impeded by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound the whole in a mortar with good pounding; then apply it to the woman's vulva and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until she reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a plaster of myrrh, and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the plaster has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze; and pinch her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fever will depart immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall lie on her back, and her feet shall hang downwards; and she lie upon the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gently press upon her belly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out that which is beneath her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on that which is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus is dependent on the hands' lateral position.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let his hand be used in the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If however she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from the mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If, however, she receives it by birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and position the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over her neck, with her hands outstretched, and its face is towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and position it easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, therefore, it is positioned, then place upon her vulva what we have described of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to press herself, and make her sneeze with the preparations.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way, with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it should be; and command the woman to press herself several times, for it will emerge through an easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not entirely live; and they are contained, although they multiply, by a single afterbirth; and they are separated by a membrane, distinct from each other, tied to the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus emerges by natural, easy exit; and they emerge by an unusual exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach the unnatural shapes we have mentioned, then treat them as we have described; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and patience, and adapt according to every shape with whatever is prepared for her to lead to their health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified by me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all this should be in the knowledge of the Midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps, indeed, it will come to her like that: therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division from medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any accident from which harm is feared to befall her, then the woman should be laid supine on the bed, upon her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her by both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os uteri with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the uterus with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it the place where to fasten the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head; then fasten the hooks to its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fasten the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should fasten another hook, or a third if needed, in opposition to it, so that there is equal contraction and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with equal extension, and the extension should not be only according to straightness, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary for that which is between it to be softened by the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so as to revolve that which is retained with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be changed to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do for the other hand and the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that a prickly Spatumile be inserted between the fingers, and that it split the head with it, and extract the water: or that it be broken with an instrument called Almisdac: the shape of which comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, he should do so if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary that he cut it with algengematu, or extract it with the misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not fold, nor yield to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower abdomen is suppurated, or contains dropsy, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture flows from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's opening is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and to split the belly or chest until that which is within them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife shall insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the opening of the womb is open, then she shall insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb; then insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the opening of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred there, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, oily things, and to apply plasters; and to sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then it should descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have already seen a woman in whose womb a dead fetus was; then she became pregnant again over it, afterward another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed upon it certain plasters of strong attraction, and the bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a stillborn fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Then I inquired about the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her better dispositions; and she has now lived thus for a long time, and sends out little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not established this as extraneous here, unless because there is knowledge and assistance in it, for what the skilled physician administers with his hand in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the shapes of the necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the shape of a Strictorium, by which books are equalized, to which there are equally two hinges at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this hinge must be finer than the strictorium: and to be made, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers: and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same type of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the hinge by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm; and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the space between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix, and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with shears, equally according to the amount of opening you wish of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife achieves what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form, with which the large head is crushed: and it is similar to a pair of forceps, having teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes elongated, like forceps of this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form with which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas, also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker is his operation, and the higher is he regarded by men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise any instrument of them, that it may not be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Secundina.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secundina is retained at the birth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with applications, and grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseham, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the lid hole of the pot, and the other end in the woman's womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep within the uterus, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the uterus does not fall during forceful traction; rather, it should be moved easily to the right and left sides; then add the amount of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the opening of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medicinal pot containing herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out by repeating the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what emerges from it to the opening of the uterus be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema to her with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will indeed cause it to putrefy after a few days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients, having experience, have known the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman experiencing retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass, similar to a beaker, or of pottery: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed above the prunas: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which a subtle sifac has already obstructed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that sifac with her finger: and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her take care that her hand does not touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to void.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now there occurs obstruction of the anus also from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter Eighty.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a Knotting, and a Swelling that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of a single part: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that knotting becomes old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by that which emerges from excretion and flatulence, when the sick person uses excretion; and perhaps worms emerge from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of them are fistulas, when they are penetrating in the space up to the bladder, and up to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them are penetrating up to the hip joint, and up to the tail bone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	By this is known a fistula penetrating to the anus, even if it is not penetrating, that you should insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a thin probe into the fistula from air or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a thread from horse hair, until you feel the probe or thread on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening by way of evacuation, nor wind, nor worm, as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its sign is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus emerges from it always; and that the medication does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in that which is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already tested; and it is, so that the sick person lies between your hands upon their back; and elevate their legs up above their hips, and their hips are inclined towards their stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however the sick person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel the probe, already having penetrated by itself detected, beyond what you feel between your finger, and between it and the flesh or the muscle: then you shall know for sure that it is penetrating; therefore do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they have said that flesh heals in some people, and from the medication from which healing is hoped for, it is that you cauterize a fine cautery according to the extent of the fistula, as was mentioned before, and you insert it, hot, into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing happens, and you see a fistula on the surface beneath the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh tissues, which resemble the hollow of a bird's quill, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you may cut those tissues, then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because a cautery with fire aggregates good habits, burns those added flesh tissues, and stops the flow of blood, and dries up the moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with linen strips dipped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the area produces pus, and the burned tissues are discharged in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and these are medicines that possess astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from bodily superfluities: then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a membrane of sift, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For it is treated in one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and a cure from the proximity.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not sever the muscle containing the anus, and an unintended outcome of defecation occurs in the sick person.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed; or you will remove the membrane, and cleanse it after you have incised it close to the anus, as we have said, either with a tenaculum or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that is in the incision, until you can see clearly with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and an open fistula remains in the interior part of the anus, and it will be less severe on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a tenaculum into the fistula; and it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the anus; then take a tenaculum with a perforated end, which is like an al-esquef needle, that is, for preparing hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and approximately so.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the tenaculum with thread into the fistula, until it reaches the concavity of it.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, the more tightly tie it, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way you are prepared, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have the skill to do this because of the muscle, lest you injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Shape the lancet, pointed, with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision; and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For either they are within the anus, like the vesicles of coal or prunes; or like grapes themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small and large; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which runs a yellowish water, or little blood with constant flowing; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you should order the sick person to strain; and it should be expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, the hooks are not retained in them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with wool from doubled fleece, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders on them, so that they may act as cauteries.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person, in which there is a small irritant, so that it may wash out what is in the anus, and yield quickly to evacuation when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy:  and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever recoils from cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wound-wrapping thread, and introduce it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the pile upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be sideways; and tighten the pile with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them; nor let it be such that blood flows from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth steeped in rose oil, or oil of cedar, and place it over the anus; and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from the dryness of excrement and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become chronic and medicine is not effective on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a sharp spatula or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they consolidate as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed profusely and are scraped, then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that almirmar is nothing other than a round knot, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail.  And it forms throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and pain occurs from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that which is around the nail, and hold it with shears or with a hook, and to uproot it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to extend the athelil and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread, or with a needle, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously stated with fire or with a sharp medicine, and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted ones with the instrument that I shall name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica is also a small, filtered, coarse elevation on the surface of the body, going deep into it; and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt in it, and is produced throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's quill or a strong vulture's feather, and place that cannula over the Formica, until the cannula's circle encompasses its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula until you cut what is around the Formica; and place it deep within the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the cannula's upper part be drawn upwards, so that the grip and turning of the wrapped and enclosed mass are lightened above the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is previously stated in the cauterization of Atheril in the chapter on the cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for bowel evacuation, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast copper, or of hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those with which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper head where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to a fine point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the bag in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal, or from the parchment of an egg, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert strong thread into those holes, from ten threads or about that number, and bind the bag with it like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bag is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tightening.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then clysterize with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the bags here depicted, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of clysterizing with it is: that you fill the bag, or bladder, with medicine that is heated according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place beneath them a *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands simultaneously, and squeeze it vigorously, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him towards an exit, then let him hold it as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more helpful in the end.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you clyster him in illnesses of loose bowels, and his exit is hasty: then clyster again, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or harmful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this be the form of a thin clyster, above which the skin be tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division on the treatment of wounds, what was fitting for the book, and I shall say here their treatment with the hand, and with medicines according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are often made, are such as the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or knife; or the impact with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And wounds which are made according to the locations of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, that I may place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome from a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and extract from him the blood according to the amount of his strength; if nothing prevents it from the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of overeating, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prevents reduction, then reduce the food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are certain of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by means of bandages, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound has already been exposed by the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in it in place of skin, and order the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like pulp; and things similar to them.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part, and cast it off; then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire into the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels when what we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, slight; so that you pulverize this powder upon them, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Flesh-healing Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be thoroughly ground, and sifted: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and is clotted with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does it, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood present.  It also does the same action in many large wounds when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If, however, it has already been altered by some alteration of the air, especially when it is summertime, then this powder's application is not suitable. Therefore, treat it with what we have said, so that you put some digestive ointments on it, or put on it poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the rest of it with the other treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	However, if a fracture occurs in a bone with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with a Gesti. And I will now state the treatment for head fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	However, if a nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment should be avoided with that which causes strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that with which it is treated from medicines be gentle, such as lime washed with fresh water, sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with fresh water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with plasters.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed an artery has been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If however the spondyles of the throat, or the whole, have been incised, and the other parts have been saved: then bring the lips of the skin together with sutures over the reed of the throat, and do not touch the throat, rather, straighten it and restore it to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable constriction, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments which have astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound becomes putrid, and its discharge is separated and relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however a bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is recalled in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter Eighty-Six.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore wind issues forth from the wound, when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, lest the blood be retained in its depth, and return to the heart, and kill the sick person: but put attractive ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, ointment is not present for you, then put old spittle into the wound opening, so that it may suck that which issues from it of moistures: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that that which collects in it may run.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three days or more have already passed since the wound, and the sick person does not experience spasms, nor a bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his/her condition good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat him/her with bandages and the other treatments, until he/she is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, his/her healing is excused, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the preceding suture if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hurry to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, for their extraction will be eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment we have stated.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	Rupture which happens to the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one therefore sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, why does their introduction occur, and their suture more vehement and difficult?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And small rupture also occurs difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hurry in their introduction to their place immediately, because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle rupture is better, because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures agree with the suture of the belly, and with the suture of the other wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly agree with the other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the suture of the belly; and I tell you each one with an explanation and a declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when a wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is because of one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine on account of the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squinants, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by it the entrance of it is relieved with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared than the incision: and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the thin end not be as thin as a spatula, but rather somewhat blunt: and it is that which resembles a caecum, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible upon it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then raise his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your intent and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you apply it in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious assistant present, who shall hold the entire rupture with his hand; and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it to him who follows in the suture something after something: and this is the mode of a single common suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's size.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then withdraw from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician; and fix one needle beyond that into which you shall insert a thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the thread that are beneath the skin from the inside, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you shall have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two ends of the thread; and four orders are formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with the doubled thread in a circle around the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until both lips of the wound are brought together with a decent closure.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then withdraw a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards tie it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of a medium thickness, between thick and thin; because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick needles are difficult to enter the skin; for this reason it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two closely situated extremities of the skin too much; so that the flesh is not pierced quickly, and the wound is opened before its healing, and they should not be pulled too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the patient in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth all around them, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this method of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one or two, or approximately that number of, needles suffice in their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second common suture is to bring together four extremities with the suture: two extremities of skin, and two extremities of the si-fac in a single turn, with a needle in which a thread wrapped around it is equal in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the suture of a cloth where cloths are tied together, and place between each suture a quantity less than the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture, however, is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I healed a wound which had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, occupied in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a marvel that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment or any medicine could be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed an old poultice upon the wound twice a day, and I assiduously washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	However, I shall describe two proper kinds of sutures according to the narration of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle extending according to the length and width of the whole body: leave the end as it was on the side in which you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate in this same end mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end sifac, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration as you cause it to penetrate in the sifac end mirach, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is from sifac to the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin, and sew the sifac end, which is on the other side, with this mirach end: and pull it out of the skin which is on its side, and do it one time, and another: and do it time after time, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the perfection of this suture is that it should resemble the sutures of leather workers when they sew skins: so that you sew sifac once on one side of one skin end: and that you leave it another time on the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech relates that one should sew it according to the manner in which certain physicians sew them, so that they bring every part to its fitting counterpart by nature: and they apply the sifac end to its other end, and the mirach end to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must place the needle into the mirach end nearest you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two sifac ends.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two sifac ends, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make them penetrate both from the inside to the outside, in the two other mirach ends, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose remembrance has preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also Galen's speech.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The belly suture is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, when you encounter a fresh wound with its blood, before air alters it; and you reduce the intestine and sew it, and fit it: then put over it a flesh-producing powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments that are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall away, and it is consolidated, and it is mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if the medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old wool: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you soak soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then inject him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putridity has already reached the intestine, and has made a penetrating exit to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small one, of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound which occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nervous nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which issues from the wound is a zirbum, and you catch it fresh, return it according to your method of returning intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black: then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place which has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the pulling of it, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus, may be alleviated.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men; because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that a bad accident would befall him in his belly; and no bad accident befell him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those having an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it takes hold upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and will not be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm befalls the sick person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is scraped much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestines is not except according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but refinement, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess, when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus continually, and is not cut away: then it is universally called a Fistula, wherever it may be on the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula, indeed, is in truth a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the hollowness of a bird's feather; and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and is scant; and is thick, and is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh between it and the lips of it, hindering the birth of flesh; or because of much filth and grime; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption falling into the region is a kind of plague, or by its property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where difficult digestion of illnesses occurs, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore know that Fistula happens in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of composite structures, such as the hand and foot; and from them are those that go to the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, which of these fistulas is in this manner, is from illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, there is a fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its treatment, and you wish to arrive at a knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the gentleness of its body, is alleviated and curves around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate from those openings of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you irrigate it, goes toward the other openings, and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know if there is a bone, or a nerve, and the fistula's cavity is deep or shallow; or if it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over all of it with all your strength, with your questioning, in which you question the sick person, and with the finding of pain from the compression with your hand over the place, and with similar signs and causes that occur with abscesses.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have stood over all those places in the correct position, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, and consider whether the fistula is shallow and apparent, or in a safe place far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or any of the places I have told you about; then cut the fistula as mentioned in my explanation, and remove what is in it through filtration, and the rotten flesh, that comes forth in its opening from the flesh, or pustules, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	However, if the fistula is deep and extensive, then it is necessary to cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its rotten flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you grasped with the iron; do this with them several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed by you, then seek it out and cut it, as I have told you: if nothing prevents you, such as a vein, a nerve, or a principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore bone is discovered by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If, however, it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly make its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If, therefore, it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in the distant depths of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then carefully draw out all of them, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, some moisture resists you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something to rot it, and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and moisture rots.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And bind the incision that you have made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil; or a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities, namely, rot and are separated from them, the bones, the removal and drawing of them will be eased.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	However, if it is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the utmost care until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	However, if that which is corrupted within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years, to whom pain occurred in his leg, from a cause which arose within his body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became a large abscess; and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time passed with the doctors' error, until the abscess was opened, and many materials escaped with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and the body's humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skillful one in the art of medicine among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the materials that ran from those openings with great flow: indeed, the entire man's body was now putrid, and his complexion was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they reached one another from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore removed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I discovered a second layer of bone above the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone; and I cut away what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I discovered it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration; and it was not restored, until I cut away about one palm's breadth from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except on account of the disposition of the weakened patient, and the paucity of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death; because it happened to him at all hours, from an excess of evacuations, evil syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore, he was healed with a complete cure: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in his body, and his strength returned: and he returned to his usual condition; and no impediment occurred to him in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, a prominent bone in a fractured part of the body exists, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: and it is that you take a ligament, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone; and command someone to extend it upwards; and place another thicker wool ligament over the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is under the bone; and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board beneath the bone appropriately below, for when you do this, it does not prevent the cutting of the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a little while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels sawing in another instance.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood beneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part; and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption for a little while, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the arch of the hand, or in the arch of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever remedy rectifies itself for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or a nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for each type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations will show you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with them.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am showing you in the final part of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will test upon others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of the saw, be made fittingly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron, and its handle of boxwood, and be a pyramid, fittingly made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of the connections of the razor.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a chisel.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the other, slender razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, slender, drawn razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the cutting of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the razor suitable for cutting that which is perforated from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise, all those things which we have said should be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter Eighty-nine.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see corruption entering the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you cut off that limb, up to where the corruption reaches, so that it may escape infirmity by it, or from the evil that is greater than the loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happens to is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or that it putrefies after the darkening: until that putrefaction is cut off up to that which follows that limb, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or the injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to advance to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it seizes the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from treatment, is the measure of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it seizes the arch of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If, however, the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you want to cut; and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the attendant extend one ligament downwards; and let the attendant extend the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloths from all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy part; and that a further injury and a hot abscess may befall the sick person.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however an internal bleeding occurs while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly; or put upon it some powders that staunch the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same event which I relate to you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his foot as a blackness, with a burning like the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man hastened himself, after he saw the corruption fall upon the limb with its violence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it fell upon the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I put upon his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me, to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that superfluity from me: and I also feared death for him in the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me of him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account, except that it may be an aid concerning that which falls from the kind of this sickness: and that it may be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and that which is within it of pus emerges, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin over it is like a cloth that has already become thin: and it does not reach the ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the mouth, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption impinges on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is, that you should cut that entire skin as it is turned: and especially when it is thinned, and made like a cloth: and you trust that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If however you hope that the skin will adhere, and that corruption does not follow from that ultimate consequence: and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and it is, that you should consider towards the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, which are combined in a vessel: and boil them over fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from that which you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the Sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is enematized with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you: and it is that you should take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from the holm oak wood: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the sick person does not have tolerance for the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then enema it with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or enema it with mixed honey and wine, since it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash: and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done it several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed: then enema it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you should take from the dyafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or enema it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, in which the enema tube does not fit: then enlarge it a little with iron: or put on it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave it the quantity into which the clyster will enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated upwards: then cut it in the lower place which is in it, so that pus runs from it downwards: because pus, when it is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from growing there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below the place you want: then try to prepare the limb by a preparation whereby pus runs from it easily as you are prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to prevent any pus from being retained there: and take the consolidating medicines which are placed over the sign, appropriate to what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors a hole in the direct opening of the Sinus, a little wider than the opening of the Sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over it, at a distance from the opening of the Sinus, so that the pus may be more easily discharged from it; and do not remove the large cloth unless after a few days at one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one over the opening of the Sinus is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out; and so that you may know if the fluid flowing from it is much or little, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or not, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the material that is discharged over the opening of the Sinus, then you should know that the Sinus is now adhering, or is approaching adhesion; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if a thin fluid discharges from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is near, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, undigested pus discharges from the Sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians ensure that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their potency, such as the ointment of diaphynicon, when superfluity of addition is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the more final means of its cure, is that you take the ointment of dyafinicon, and it be dissolved with rose oil, and ancient wine be sprinkled over it, equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it performs a similar action to this, when you do not have the ointment of dyafinicon present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line it with the honey you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily itself, and the herb's flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them, simple or aggregated, grind them, and sift them: and powder them over the honey that I have spoken of, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus condition persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is now making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of Fistulas, as has been previously described.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of whitlow and the worn-out nail, and the incision of the added finger, and the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted and emits pus until it gnaws away the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the entire nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut with an iron the entire excess remaining from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary to place a thin radium under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however corruption has already impressed itself upon the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it; for it will never be healed while corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the remembrance of its preceding description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there is a rubbing or striking of the nail, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the infirm person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumili in a transverse cut from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care that the cut does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause great pain to the infirm person through it, and it will be the cause of the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with that which relieves pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The extra finger which is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that is born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that is born near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, that you should cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, in that which arises in the finger at the last nodes, then it is necessary to cut its flesh first, with a round incision, until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation, however, which happens to fingers together, happens often either from the birth of a man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, between them: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-Two.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Ulcers are veins that are wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and those who labor, and those who carry loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile occasionally with a strong shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomize the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, their treatment with iron, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the whole of it extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, its section is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg with much hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg, up to the top, and the phlebotomist should first treat the patient from above.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail until below, until the amount of blood you see is sufficient and the patient's strength can tolerate it.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards, tie it; and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, its elevation is in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse it in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg until it turns red, and the veins bulge; or have him exercise vigorously, if a bath is not available, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses; and at its appearance, you will see it slope from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it emerges from the skin, you see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe underneath it, until when it is lifted and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision, by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift, and cut it with the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you pull it out of the incision that is above, or higher than all the other incisions, until the whole thing comes out; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	However, if it does not yield to pulling and lifting, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a reed under it, and revolve your hand in every direction until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and it enters upon the weak from it injury.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it all out, then place on the wound a wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping around the parts, and it is not, as we said, according to straightness, then it is necessary to cut upon it in every direction of its twisting and its wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it entirely, and be careful at your cutting upon it lest you strike a vein or wound it, for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of the Incision by which the Vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound a vein; and it has a thick, smooth bend, for if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness; indeed, it should have superfluous thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in legs in hot lands, such as the Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in which no grass grows, nor any tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that happens beneath the skin, just as happen within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a severe inflammation happens in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the location of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachma keil to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something emerges from it outward, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends too far, then cut off part of it and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently drawn out gradually until the last part of it emerges, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein, in some men, emerges what is five palms and ten in its length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already come to me that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it is incised during your hour of treatment, then insert a probe into its opening and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it is evacuated from the material; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in some land among us Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it shows itself to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts wherever it bursts a place in the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and ascarides, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared for its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes through the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens there and emerges, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to treat it and extract it, then it is not done except through its movement and its appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the place with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve the bad, putrid humours.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision above the illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in some limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who was ill in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I had stayed an hour, I saw one swelling move with a twitch, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible; so that it was like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who experience pain changing from limb to limb; and I did not see it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is otherwise, except because she was from those who are of dry bodies, detected veins: hence, that windy quality is revealed to the senses by that changing quality.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then press above it, and beneath it quickly; and cut above it, until that constrained windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and quiets them with foul pills, and pills of hellebore, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows vary according to their types and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such that some have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, that are according to the limbs on which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the limbs are from the principal concave limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and those like them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore, when it falls into any of these limbs, and signs of death appear to you, which I shall tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in whomever it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the siphac which is over the brain, are: because vehement sweat, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera occur from it.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will exit from the nostrils, or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And white moisture like gruel exits from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it exits something similar to the watery substance of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that the person feels as if it is fixed in a hard object, not an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death is undoubtedly approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the patient's complexion changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow strikes the covering, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasp with violent pain, with a sigh; and all the members of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food will issue from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow strikes the belly, and is lodged in it, something of excrement, or zirb, or intestine, already ruptured, will issue from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine escapes, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, armpit, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved according to several methods when the arrow does not strike an artery, or nerve, and the arrow is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may understand through it your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I pulled it out of him on the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I pulled out another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid.  The arrow was already hidden, and I only recovered a small portion of it, with which it adheres to its shaft.  It was a large arrow, from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, and it had no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil accident occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and it is of the kind that has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I cut above it between the two guide-pieces.  And it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had lodged in his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed over him, and nothing had changed regarding his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I worked on it, and I extracted it; and he was healed, and no ill accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound upon it was healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound upon it was healed, and the arrow remained within her; and no change was made in her condition, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, on whom an arrow had fallen on his face; and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar cases like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already bent slightly to the right side; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's fall, for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore, I sought it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and indeed he felt a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore, I hoped that that prick was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster that had attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would suppurate and that the arrowhead would show, so that I might cut upon it; and it did not happen that an event signifying that the arrow had entered the area occurred.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days; and no event occurred, and the wound meanwhile consolidated; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, and I felt the slender tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrow became visible to us; and about four months passed with him during that time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had become enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield to removal; then I did not cease to refine and devise methods regarding it, until on a certain day I began to use properly made forceps, according to the form they will have at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place it as a rule and meaning upon that which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by the narrative; nor does that book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares little with much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the contrary of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to exit at the time it strikes, then it is necessary that you leave it for a few days, until the flesh around it has rotted: and its traction is relieved, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not obey you for exit, then leave it also for a few days: and repeatedly treat it with traction and movement every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine awl, until the arrow's grip is loosened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the ills that I have mentioned appear from the injured person, then abstain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until its condition is equal after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the injured person remains for several days, and nothing of those ills happens to him: then proceed in the pulling of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in pulling: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot get at it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge upon it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If, however, there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by all the means that you can, and if means, if it cannot be freed by the separation of the flesh, or by the fracture or twisting of the ears, until it escapes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape; and use the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot get at it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding tissues become putrid.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for it will be easier afterward.  If, however, the flow of blood causes you difficulty, then administer what we have said about its treatment in the relevant chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use all the means possible to you for the escape of the arrow; and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I have instructed you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that it be weak according to the shape in which the arrow was lodged.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, either something is already protruding outwards; or the arrow's tip causes a bulge on the surface of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding; therefore, cut over it, and let the cut be according to the size that the forceps can take.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for it then becomes easy to extract.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If however it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed into the bone and enlarges itself; then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's shaft is in it, then drive it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer an impulse, then introduce a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then drive it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then drive it out with an instrument that enters it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is eased by it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If however the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize the whole flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or belly, or bladder, or flank; and is near to what you touch with your probe, and you can cut above it; then cut and beware of cutting a vein or nerve and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the impelling concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the impelling deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is a deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this impelling concave is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entrance into it and its impulse may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Of the phlebotomy of the veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be bled, whose custom has run through the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called two Herbs; and two arteries, which are visible in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called Looking; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.

Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins which are opened by phlebotomy in the arms are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the head vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Tickler.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the common people call it the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the Arm Cord, and it is situated above the fold: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is which is under the curve of the thumb from the wild side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is Saphena: and its place is at the heel from the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the wild side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomies of the two veins located behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and headache, and old, troublesome ulcers of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is that the head of the sick person be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the location of the two veins with a rough cloth by good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the sick person tighten his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears, in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with ink there.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a lancet, and that is called the incisor.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the lancet reaches the opening.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers, or about that; and cause as much blood to issue forth as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now, at the beginning of the book, the incision of those, and their cauterization, has preceded.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is helpful for old hemiplegia; and for crookedness of the neck, and constant ophthalmia; and for the excessive flow of acute secretions to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is as I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the sick person stretch his neck a great deal, until two veins become distinctly visible to the eye; and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark the signs with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet cutting underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and cause blood to flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger over the vein for an hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, place a bandage and pads over it, and bind it tightly over the constriction: and leave it until it heals.

Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And lance it across [the wound], since the bone is close by; and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein is not visible to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and cause blood to flow according to your need.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins, Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the constrictions that are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should sit between your hands in front of the sun; and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein; and the color of each is sloping towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize each one; and guard, lest you put your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy has become customary in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or with an olive-shaped one, of a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and thin varieties according to the width and narrowness of the veins.  The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of smaller width and finer extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help for phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for an artery is below it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, if he errs, and adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and a flood of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary, that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, let him cut it with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to leave it alone and shift to another, or seek one of its branches; or phlebotomize the Brachial vein in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed clear, and cut it with the phlebotomy Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you wish phlebotomy of the same, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with encaustic, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the phlebotomy Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the blow does not fall through a space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you constrict the ligature, inflation in the place that you marked with encaustic, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and it is subtle, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If, therefore, blood is cut (for it is often cut), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the sick person beware of its movement; and let it be above their fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If, however, the blood is not cut, and it overcomes you; and there is no medicine present to you at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and constrict it over the place of the vein's constriction, fittingly, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with him whose preceding account of removing the flow of blood from the powder locations: and the excision of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small location of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalica, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it befits the phlebotomist to be wary of his phlebotomy, for there is a nerve beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds to the puncture, and finds a nerve, numbness results, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you position your phlebotomy, using it to cut, with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, to prick it with an olive-wood lancet or a myrtle lancet, because it is safer than all other veins, since there is no artery or nerve underneath.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid striking only the head of the muscle, and to seek a softer location; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be struck again with the lancet several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it becomes inflamed in some people when it is not lanced on the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its resulting complications, about which you should be concerned.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and protection from the arrival of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital vein.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy is performed at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in Spring and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed of the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a fixed time; but when convenience and necessity prompt it, by night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines beforehand with a mild clyster, if there is much retained fecal matter, so that the veins, during phlebotomy, do not draw putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient suffering from a nausea-inducing fullness, nor one suffering from indigestion, nor one recovering from intoxication be bled until that condition has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissolves the strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to have it.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing hinders him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anxiety, and anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive sexual activity, and those similar to them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present at his seat things with whose use the custom of men has run from aromatics, and scents, and dances, and things similar to them, in as great a quantity as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterward, let him extend his arm and rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its relaxation, then also it hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then, after the constriction, the phlebotomist should rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left index finger on the vein itself, just below the place where he intends to phlebotomize, a little bit; so that the vein does not flee, and the puncture fails.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from the veins, some are like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy; and from them is one that is full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotom on it, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is narrow. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should lay down the phlebotom.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened at once, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time below that place a little, or above it with haste, if the place is not ulcerated.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If, however, it becomes ulcerated, or the patient becomes fearful, then leave him for a day or two days, and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat bloodletting, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not escape, then repeat bloodletting in the same opening according to its alignment, and add a little in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before the place becomes an abscess, for in many people a small operation causes the place to become an abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for it will not excuse anything in your favor.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of olive dregs upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer olive dregs in all your phlebotomies, through which you make blood vessels stop flowing: and Tyriac alfarach and sagzenea do this, when put on the location from either of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is made thinner and is resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially in one who is not a phlebotomist at that time, or if the opening of the vein is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little, over the area, and hold it for an hour, because it is dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does not harm. And if you wish, place some dissolved aloe or myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, balm, or similar to it, upon it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomies of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon compressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be careful to place something from what we have said upon it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may become hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit, until it becomes red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be broadened, and that the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to one who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary to give food before the phlebotomy of moderate bread soaked in pomegranate water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and to extract from his blood in three or four stages.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then he should take bread soaked in miua syrup, or in syrup of spiced honey, or in fragrant aromatic syrup before the phlebotomy.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he take in a drink of meat water and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with algalia, and let his chest be smeared with it; and let him use the rest which we have mentioned in the division on fainting in the chapter on evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wants to purge his arm and release his blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation and whose strength is weak, that he release his blood gradually according to the quantity of his strength in successive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wants to purge his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be purged on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	However, in whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one time and a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not fitting, when you wish to purge the arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it with violence, and to quickly bend or stretch it.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it until the phlebotomy is performed a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening and put some dissolved salt in water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, upon it, and apply gentle pressure until the blood emerges.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, the vein has already become inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If, however, necessity compels you to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The arm's vein is to be phlebotomized at the place of the Basilic vein and the Cephalic vein, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of medium tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then, phlebotomize it transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be ample, and let your phlebotomy be just above the wrist joint for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is prevented, then again immerse the hand in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however, you are in the days of summer, then you may refrain from repeating the immersion of the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the greatest amount of blood flow is placed in warm water in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should tie the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then pierce it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to the warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening, and its flow will be prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it will not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, you should do the same with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly, do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menses, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs that are old, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the method of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water, and make friction upon it until the veins protrude; and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed, the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and from it branches out many branches on the front of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the front of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the exit of blood is obstructed, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the aid of phlebotomy for it is, for the pain of the hip, when it is because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should enter a bath and hurry; and tighten his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers, with a long thin strip: for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it therefore appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it in whatever way is possible for you, or in a transverse manner; and it is better to cut it with an incision, or to sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then the phlebotomist should cut some branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and make the blood run in the amount you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tightening, and place a leather over the phlebotomy site, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping vessels are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One is with scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cuppings that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and they are two in the neck, from both sides simultaneously; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of Alachosos at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two shins.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small, scattered veins in the flesh, and because of that, no strength is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the entire body has been emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts cupping for an illness, or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them, so that they need its extraction through cupping, experience heaviness and headache in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And some of them experience fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And some of them experience itching on their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And some of them scratch the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And some of them experience increased laughter.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And some of them experience increased sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order a venesection to be performed, after two or three hours have passed during the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and that which is discharged to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this venesection is in place of a phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted to use it for one of cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not fitting for the elderly to use it, and for those whose heads have cold illnesses.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes assiduous over it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, it is necessary to command the Ventilator to lay his hand with the windpipe a little lower, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventilation, or Alkehel, is in the place of the phlebotomy of the Fuscous vein, and the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein, and because of this, it contributes to asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing instrument, and cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping be impelled for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventilation of the alhagdahim contributes to accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to command the Ventilator not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventilation under the chin contributes to sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to them the diseases that are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the phlebotomy of the alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventilation of the spatulas contributes to alchafacham, which is caused by reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventilation of the inner parts of the two focilium contributes to the benefit of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalicae, because it draws blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventilator not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the area is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A cupping that is applied over the alchausos contributes to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Ventilator that the cupping should be large and made of air, because the area needs strong suction, and perhaps the delicate cuppings will break; and it should be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cuppings of the legs diminish noticeably, because they draw blood from the whole body, and they contribute to old pains in the kidneys, and the uterus, and the bladder; they provoke menstruation, and contribute to bothor and ademenul; and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the cupping of alhorcobeni is similar in benefit to the cupping of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of positioning cuppings is to place the cupping initially empty, and to apply suction with moderate strength; and do not prolong the positioning of the cuppings, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the area with even arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue it, until you see the area already reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then, therefore, scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of delicate flesh, with infrequent pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more, so that the area is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to amplify the scarification, and slightly deepen it; and moderate the suction with ease, speed, and smooth movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, in the first instance, a path is opened to the thinning of the blood and its aquosity; and in the second, to the thorough investigation of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If truly the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so that the final result is achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little bit at a time, one scarification suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish for a multiple extraction of blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is it that should be administered from oils at the application of cupping, and what should the cupper avoid?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the cupping places with opening, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in summer, such as the oil of alkeiri, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbatine oil, and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If, however, the excess is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or white oil, or anise oil: and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If, however, the cupper is of large pores, soft flesh: then it is necessary that he refrain from oil, and that he wash the cupping places after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and with similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	However, he whose blood is of great humidity, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	However, he whose excesses are thick, should wash his cuppings with old wine, or with water of fumitory, or with an anise decoction, or camomile, and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be cautious about cupping in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath; indeed, it is necessary to administer it after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fitting for someone to sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that should be regulated for a cupper, or phlebotomist, before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary to consider first: then if the cupper, or phlebotomist, is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood, then it is necessary that he take things that cool it, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food chickens, and mutton sekebiget, and seasoned foods with gooseberries, and similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds, and he should drink medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and it is prescribed that he use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food chickens, and canebir, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and doves' young.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food, and it is necessary that in some men, in the hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine from musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe, be given in the drink before cupping, or before bloodletting, or after, so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, cupping that is without scarification is cupping that is placed upon the liver, and the spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, the navel, and the regions of the kidneys, and the receptacle of the lungs, because these members do not endure scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought for except either by the drawing of blood from a member to a member, as we place cupping upon the breasts in illness of a nasal discharge of blood.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release a cold, viscous windiness from a member; as we place a cupping upon the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain for this reason, because it has resolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys, when obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its attractive power, perhaps it opens the obstruction, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen, when there is windiness to be broken in each of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is, that the cupping glass be filled, and be large, with only warm water, or water in which herbs suitable to it have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let its opening be the width of two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, at a point approximately in the middle of it, according to the size for a needle to enter it: let it be made of bronze at once, or brass, of thick, smooth, equal, and polished edges, so that it does not hurt the limb in its position on it: and let there be a transverse rod of bronze or iron in its middle, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we have described, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For cupping glasses for children and thin people are different from cupping glasses for men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is as follows: light a wick with fire from flax properly, or a small candle made of wax, and place it over the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is burning approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the limb, and a finger is placed over the hole I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass: while needed, remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately release.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then relight the wick in its proper way, and do it again if needed.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in a cupping glass administered for pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole; and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this cupping glass is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the suspension of bloodsuckers.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-Nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodsuckers are not applied in many cases, unless in those limbs where the application of cupping is impossible due to their small size, such as the lip, and gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should use leeches which are in fresh water, free from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are to be kept in fresh water, day and night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be emptied first with bloodletting, and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it is red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place with the cupping instrument is possible, then it is more effective in helping; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it shall be rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood after the fall of the Sanguisugarum is prolonged, and it is oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over it, until the oozing is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder on it ground zegi, or gallnuts, and similar astringents, until the bleeding is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place on the area the halved, peeled beans: and let them be left, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if a repetition of Sanguisugarum is necessary, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If leeches are prevented from hanging on, then the place should be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or pierce the area with a needle until some blood is expelled.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed, for when they sense some blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, sprinkle some ground aloe, or salt, or ash over them; and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration, dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar matters.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O children, that foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, those who have never examined the books of the ancients, nor read a letter from them.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and have not attained that which I have attained unless through the length of studying ancient books, and diligence in understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experiment passed, after I have abridged it for you, and delivered it from the occupation of elongation, and abridged it by the end of abridgment, and showed it at the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections concerning the existence of broken bones, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin to recall the broken limbs, and of different ones, if of each.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to summarise the discourse and chapters, the understanding of which compels the craftsman first to stand upon their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall, happens to someone, then it is necessary, first, to hasten to phlebotomize him and to release him, or both at once: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom something of these has happened is a child, or an old decrepit man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with food, cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds and kids; and forbid wine, and heavy meats, and filling himself with food and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb; then let the sick man return to his first regimen, with which his habit has run.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and heavy wine, and things similar to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is made quicker and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they are continuously and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs; and those that are in them at the end of youth are consolidated and united, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, to the fractured bone on every side, to adhere to and bind it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of its strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing hinders it from its functions; and for this reason it is necessary to provide the sick person with foods, in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull; and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another; and I have come with a recollection of every type of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fractures are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture is curved, besides which splinters occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and its fractures are jagged, that is, splinters and progressing additions, as are in a reed when a knife is applied to write with it.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not progressing; and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head; and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has its own nature, or instrument, in its restoration, according to which its recollection will come, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, is its twisting, and its own prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting, nor sound upon touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the sick person experience great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is twisting, or a small fissure; therefore, it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression altogether, but rather place upon it from the remedies, of which recollection comes, after the moment that suits the place; then let a subtle constriction be applied.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent and split in two, apart from the struggles that happen in it, however every part is removed from its counterpart: then it is necessary for you to begin at your hour for its rectification, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	However, if a hot abscess occurs on it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to whatever method is possible through gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration and equalization of it is easier than of a bone in which struggles occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what will come to you as a reminder of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If, however, there are struggles in the bone, then the extension of this broken limb is necessary, from two parts, if it is a hand or a foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an equal place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive, as you are able, to restore those additions to their places with all skill, and by any method you can: and be careful, according to your strength, that no pain or injury befall the weak by your operation; and strive, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour that you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, rectify it and make it equal by the amount of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and forceful compression, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through that operation of theirs, as we have often seen it from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the equalization, and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility, and advise the sick person concerning it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And have him beware that he does not move it during his waking hours, and his sleep at its turnings, and his restlessness, and his defecation, and all his movements with his utmost ability.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware lest the position of the limb be one which will be followed by pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For when he feels pain or injury in the arrangement of the limb's position, then it is necessary to change it to a different arrangement in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him that its position be even, straight, so that twisting does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the limb is, according to what I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them that are small, like the arm, and the finger, and the toe, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	However, those of them that are large, like the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be in them a broad, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligament connects a large limb, and binds it from every side with equal tightness, so that no blemish enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, in soft linen over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your tightening, with which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away from the place of the fracture with the bandage a little, and gradually loosen the tightness, until you take hold of a large part from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the fractured place in wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards, proceed with the bandage to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightness of the bandage, and its loosening, according to what we said in the first wrapping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages soft stuffing, or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is equalized, if there is twisting in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, place over these bandages evenly made plasters immediately, if there is no swelling or a hot abscess in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place over it that which will settle the abscess and remove the swelling, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind plasters over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the plasters be from the halves of broad canes, shaved, and cleverly shaped; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, that is, from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of each plaster, according to this form and this same figure, be such.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the plaster placed over the wound should be somewhat thicker and wider than the other plasters; and the length of the plaster should be according to the size and narrowness of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind another bandage over the plasters, according to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind it above with threads neatly, according to what we said about the binding; and let your bandage be tighter over the fracture site, and the looser the further it is from the fracture.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and be made of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the work of foolish men who use twisted flax cords for their threads, it is a great error, because the bandage falls off with them outside the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them through the bandage what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And there should not be less than a finger's breadth between stitch and stitch.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the stitches after the bandage on healthy parts, then place under them soft linen or dyed wool, until nothing is hurt by that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a recollection of it in the second chapter on the individuality of such cases.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is because, when the limb is large, you should not place splints upon it unless after five, or seven, or more days, according to your safety concerning the outcome of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients restored those applied to fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A method of an abbreviated common plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is from such a thing that neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you should take from the mill's dust, and it is the flour's medulla that hangs in the mill's walls in the movement of the millstone; and make it into a paste, just as it is, except that you should sieve it with the white of an egg; and place its preparation neither thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster, restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; and the juice of all, a drachm X; myrrh, and aloes, both a drachm V; and alethil a drachm XX.  Grind all, sieve, and mix with alethil water; or with the white of an egg, if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also benefits fractures and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, mess, and white althea, of all a drachm X; myrrh and aloes, both a drachm V; acacia a drachm VI; Armenian bole a drachm XX. Grind all thoroughly, sieve, and make into a paste with water or the white of an egg; and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain that occurs to them, and the fissure of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in quieting a hot abscess, and it expels pain properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the wild fig, and leaves of the wild poppy: and grind them all together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a fractured bone, and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take of the root of althea, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground together, and be made into a paste with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If however it is heated, then make it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A method of another stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take of the root of althea, and linseed, and pomegranate seeds, and melilot, and sorrel, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part: let all be ground together, and be made into a paste with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the limb, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that something should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, except a preparation made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he recounted that it should be intermediate in consistency between thick and thin.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, considered that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration that contain a drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar to them from those which we have recounted.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster that is helpful for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, and chickpeas, and the hairs of a man's head cut off, or the feathers of a bird, and marshmallow, and salt in equal parts: grind them, and sieve them, and mix them together: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount of time for which the bandage should remain, then be removed, is as follows: consider if the patient experiences no pain, no itching, and the fractured bone does not move from its position; then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	However, if intense itching, or troubling pain, or swelling occurs at the site, then quickly remove it at once, and take the plaster away from it. And take a soft cloth or a soft sea sponge, wet it and immerse it in lukewarm water and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then leave the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it soft wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it over it for one night until you are sure of the absence of a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then, again, apply a delicate bandage and a small plaster; and do not tighten it with your first constriction, and use gentle ones until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the symptoms are completely gone, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then reapply it as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we have said happen to the limb, then do not loosen it, except after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed, according to what you see from the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh's coagulation approximates it, then add even more than your first bandage in tightness, and add also in increasing the dressing of the weak flesh, according to the preceding account of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	However, if you see the fracture site already drying out and becoming more emaciated than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, anoint it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let it be for all three days, and slightly relieve the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what foolish restorers do with a limb fracture a second time, when it is not restored properly at first, and restored according to twisting, is an error in their operation, and great fear. And if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of it anywhere at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the accidental injury to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its shapes numerous; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which occurs from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and on account of this, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts a portion of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its innermost part; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a lifting completely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or things similar to these.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane that is beneath the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture, which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of this this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of them is a fracture which occurs from a fall or from a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter into the interior, and a concavity is made; as happens to copper cauldrons, when a blow strikes them, and a part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures produce separate fragments, and I will come with a reminder of all of it in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fracture through probing over it, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	However, the Capillary type is known by this, that it is detected on the bone, and wiped clean, and anointed over it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In treating a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then, if you see from the symptoms that it signifies clearly a fear, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, protruding eyes, redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms in various conditions, undoubtedly it will not be cured; and if you see symptoms that do not frighten you, and you hope for a cure: then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is during the winter days, then it is necessary to diligently attempt the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every aspect.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the bandage is corrupted, and those symptoms that we have described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the bandage touching the brain, and is with fragments and pulling: then it is necessary to remove the broken and ground portion, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is to shave the head of the wounded person, and expose the bone in any way possible to you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is easy for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If, during the exposure of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose-water, and to allow the wound to rest until the abscess subsides and you are safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of a narrow edge; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another scalpel, somewhat wider than the first scalpel; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer yet another scalpel, even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have a number of different scalpels, some wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let their edges be sharp, and let them be made of iron or steel; and use ease in striking upon the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head, and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary, that you pierce around it, before you administer the scalpels, with drills called *Terebrae* that do not penetrate deeply; and they are not called thus, except because they do not pass through the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it; because the drill has a round tip on that which is below its pointed head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it befits you to take from these drills a multitude, each fitting the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull; the tip of whose sharpness in length and shortness must be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepanners.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The method of piercing around the fractured bone is: to place the drill on the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place it such that there is between each hole the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the chisels what is between each hole from the bone, and make it finer than you can above it from the end for lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other instruments which you have prepared for it, such as pliers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you beware with all caution, lest the drill or chisel touch anything of the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the siphac, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more subtle than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If any small bones and splinters remain, then remove them easily with whatever instruments you have.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with the plasters and ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen said, and praised greatly: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	You must first begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until you have exposed that part and placed the end of this lenticular chisel, whose form is this, upon it.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part does not cut anything; and its sharp part extends along its two sides, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the bone, its sharp edge meeting the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the chisel from one side with a small mallet until you cut the entire bone with ease, as if it were turning over, and you are sure from the bandage that no accident will happen to it that you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, and were not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in some places, he would cut it from it with the end of his lenticular chisel, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is separated from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and fine irregularities, then it is necessary to scrape that roughness and eradicate those irregularities with the fine razors of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that you may be able to apply the most suitable and straightest of them in every appropriate place, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you apply in your judgment, by which in the first place you scrape the bone, the wider of those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at applying the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every remaining small fissure, and delicate fracture, it is necessary to apply care, according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter not hidden from anyone who has any diligence in this art, and stood upon that which we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the flap is retained when you extract the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do it as easily as possible upon it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a broad bandage over it: and do not tighten it, except for the amount that holds the wound only; and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are certain of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and apply after it medicines with which superfluous dryness is overcome; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them; and it is, that you should make a powder from these medicines, which should be powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply in it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And carefully, according to your ability, ensure that the wound in your treatment is clean; neither be there any filth of ointment, nor any grime.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow the virus to gather on it at all; for when the virus gathers on the brain tissue, it corrupts it and rots it, and great harm results to the sick person afterward; and this happens in head sores, when the bone is uncovered, especially when its care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, if the sick person experiences the accidents we have described, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness occurs only from the medicine applied to it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and a linen cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it over the ulcer: afterwards, treat it with the appropriate methods of healing until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only the two upper parts of the nose are broken simultaneously, or one of them; because it is composed of two bones.  Because the lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and it only suffers attrition, twisting, and distortion.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nostril and align the fracture with your index and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware lest your treatment cause pain to the patient.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it is necessary to align it with the end of a radius, where it has a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the quiet of a hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a bandage made of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the bandage have a thickness of such a quantity as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the bandages should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, that does not seem to me suitable; rather, the bandage should be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the bandage until the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a bandage, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it; and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so that the weak person is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, make bandages.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while treating a hot abscess, the nose should again become inflamed, plaster the nose with cerote, or with cotton steeped in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then you should plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to saw over them and remove them with instruments suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the wound, and treat it with what heals and strengthens it with appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with bandages and administer a lead cannula until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then consider if its fracture is only from the outside, and is not broken into two, and is bent inward: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on its right side, insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push the curvature of the fracture from within, outwardly, with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with that make it level.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer traction from both sides, according to the straightness, until its alignment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, movement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then tie those you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and put a large, properly made pledget on the cloth; or a piece of leather sole, equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it above, according to how its bandage is prepared and its application is suitable, until it does not break; and command the sick person to use tranquility and rest; and give his food in the form of soft drinks.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something has already changed in shape in any way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While, therefore, that plaster remains attached to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess should occur, then administer that which we have often said in its abatement, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a fragment has already separated from the bone, or from the splinters, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those splinters with what suits you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, the wound's opening is constricted, then widen it with a phlebotome according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then treat the wound's opening, if it is wide; and if not, place on it from plasters that are suitable to it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Forcep, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Forcep is most often broken at the anterior humeral portion, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates into two, apart from any splinters that may be in it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support following the broken Forcep, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it ought to be: and there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend and lift the Forcep, and tighten the sphere with your hand, until you make the fracture straight, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the Forcep outwards, because it has reached deep inside, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their back: and you should place a cushion of medium size under their shoulder, and the assistant should press down on their shoulder until the bone of the Forcep that is deep is raised upwards: and then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel a splinter from the Forcep, and it moves, then it is necessary to cut above it and extract the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is retained in the bone, then make an incision on it with one of the knives you prepared for it, after you have placed under the Forcep the instrument that holds the splinter: and it is an instrument of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon without a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need from the size of the bone and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the wound that you have cut when you extracted the fragment of bone is wide, and you are secure from a hot abscess: then gather the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the amount of the wound's incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then immerse a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, a constriction of the bone when it is without a wound, and without incision, is such that you should place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft bandage over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its throbbing, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the bandage and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a strip of thin wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the strip of wood in the place of the alhimemati which falls on the fracture and the area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it around its neck, and under its sound and its diseased titillico: and restore it to every part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture with a proper constriction: and this is that which is not hidden from you, and all of it, so that the strip of wood is not removed from above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary that you look after the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens and you see the strip of wood already removed, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his arm at his sleep at night, so that with it his aid is raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore the fracture of the fork is raised by raising the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the ligament if there is no occurrence in the place of itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see its face on it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave him until he is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the fork is tightened and strengthened most often in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely broken, and in its broad area: and only its edges are broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a part of it breaks, and it breaks in the middle, and it is not recognized except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore it to its natural form by every means of skill that is possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and soft linen, and place a cushion of doubled cloth upon it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a broad splint of thin board, according to the size of the entire scapula, or a little larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a hollow under the splint in any place of the scapula, then fill that hollow with soft linen until the splint descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with a long bandage, with appropriate constriction and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever, therefore, the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place; and let the invalid lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the scapula itself is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When, therefore, this number is completed, then loosen the bandage, and be you secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is itself from bones whose junction is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, a fragment proceeds from the bone, and pierces beneath the skin, then split over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything occurs from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a fractured breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities indeed are broken and crushed very much from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which inclines downwards, and a great pain and difficulty in breathing and coughing befall it; and perhaps it vomits blood, and a hollow is shown in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the senses, its restoration is that the sick person be laid upon his back, and a bolster be placed between his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands, and make them even in their position, according to all ways in which it is possible and fitting, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and linen on it, and place a thin board made of willow or chalice, or similar light materials, upon it, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make it neat in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go around with the bandage to the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if its need provokes its loosening through itching or a corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess, then quickly loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what occurred with the manner of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see it is suitable; and bind it tightly until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick areas following the back, and from their extremities on the anterior side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in an investigation with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that one equalizes the fracture with the fingers to the extent possible, until the shape is equalized, as is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs them.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inward, then a severe pain and a stabbing pain occur to the sick person, like the stabbing pain that occurs to one who has pleurisy; because the bone stabs the covering, and also difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood occur; and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients were ingenious in it with many ideas; and of them are some who say that one should place foods for the sick person that produce inflammation and windiness, so that the belly may be inflamed and stretched, and the fracture may be driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we abhor that a quick cause for making a hot abscess be made, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already occurred, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a windy thing be placed on the place, then be sucked with strength, and it is similar reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy thing will draw superfluities to the place, due to the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the place ought to be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled; so that there is an even bandage when you wrap it around the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a violent thing is constricting the sick person, which he cannot tolerate, and the mouth is pricked by a wound-causing prick, and we fear for the sick person, then it is necessary to cut open over the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place on it the instrument which preserves the syfack, whose mention preceded: and cut the bone with ease, and cut it open.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and let us treat it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a hot abscess should occur, then hurry, and pour pillows in rose oil, and place on the spot; and let the sick person be treated with that which is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and likewise to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and one wishes to know whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it does not heal, and in many cases is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels contraction in them with fingers and pricking, then know that the neck bone is intact, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar condition occurs in the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet.  If you see that they are softened, and the same condition occurs in them as in the hands; then, when he lies on his back, wind and excrement pass without will; and when he lies on his stomach, excrement passes without will; and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what occurs from that is, to attempt to soothe the hot abscess.  Thus, you should place crushed rose oil on the vertebra, or with roasted egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that upon it several times a day, until when the hot abscess subsides; then place a strengthening, drying plaster over the spot, and bind it with a bandage; and instruct the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If, however, it happens that the bone is abraded, or something is already separated from it, then it is necessary to slice over the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the last bone of the alhausos is broken, and it is the end of the tail, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and to straighten the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second straightening.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it over it and remove it, and treat the wound with the preceding treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the Ancha.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the Anchars are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless a shattering occurs at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise, and are deflected inwards; and pain and a puncture occur in the place, and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture in the manner of its form.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the equalization, until it is made similar to its natural form.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is lengthwise, or already deflects inwards, then cause the sick person to lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place a plaster over it; then place over it a splint of wood or leather; and bind it with a bandage over which you need not fear a change in the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from the extension of it, and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is fitting.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens in the bone, a splinter, or if it is broken, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured Adiutorium.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from a raised place, and the sick person sits upon it.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his broken arm upon the wood, until it reaches the point where the curvature of the wood is attached to the middle of it.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should bring the fracture together with his hands, until the fracture returns to the way it should be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person is laid on their back, and their arm is suspended from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two attendants, that one of them should hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other should hold below it, and let each of them extend to their respective side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two attendants extend them to their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed below the armpit, and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that spot, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then set the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is set as it should be, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it; and the way of binding it is, that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then support the arm with the aid itself, and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind the supporting arm, so that the arm stands in the position of stars; if nothing hinders you from it, nor is anything of the broken bone moved upon you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something of the broken bone may be moved upon you, then use splints; and it is, that you place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints the binding which I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the less the binding should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the splints and the binding, as we said, at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, that there be no itching or swelling in the place, or that food be prevented from reaching the limb, because of the disposition of superfluous moisture from the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore rectify all of that, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are confident that nothing will happen from that: then do not loosen the binding, except after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the sick person's sleep be on their back, and their hands on their stomach; and place a mattress full of wool evenly under the aid.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day that the shape of the fractured limb not be undone or the binding softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, rectify all of it with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the sick person food according to the order we have previously mentioned, so that the food is subtle at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary to make his food thicker.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the injured leg and foot to tighten in forty days; therefore it is necessary to loosen it, and to administer a bath, and to medicate it with ointments which rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, bruised, then do not loosen the bandages and splints from it until fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of them is small, and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is positioned under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm bone is broken, or the smaller one, or perhaps both are broken simultaneously.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the forearm bone is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than that is when both bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, upon restoring it, to apply a small amount of extension with ease until he has made it even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If, however, the larger forearm bone is that which is broken, then it is necessary that he apply a very strong bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand during its restoration, and its extended extension upon a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers, or the others; and let the sick person sit upright on himself, and let the pillow be before him, or in a straight line with him, in height, so that the sick person does not incur exertion.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should align the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fragments in the broken bone, then endeavor to return every fragment to its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If, however, a separate fragment is apparent in it, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then cut upon it, and remove it according to the method we have described in the preceding matters.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on it, therefore take the treatment of that from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess arises at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a cerotum made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium thickness and fineness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage, until when the abscess subsides: then remove the cerotum, and place a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements, whether the fracture is in one or in two bones simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the fracture site more firmly and strongly, and somewhat more tightly with the bandage towards the upper or lower part of the fracture: or place a softer bandage a little less tight than that, according to what has been previously mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths wrapped around the fracture be soft, damp; and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, properly, of medium thickness between thin and thick, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens requiring correction, such as itching occurring in the limb, then it is necessary to bathe the limb in warm water until that itching ceases, and to leave the limb unbandaged until it is quiet, then to reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage is already softened, and the bone is already separated, and similar things to those: then correct it all with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and to leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then to bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, except after twenty days, or about this many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the sick person's hand should be suspended from their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let their neck be level, and let it be protected by its own strength from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And have him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the hand's pectines and the knots of the fingers rarely happens.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless there is very frequent attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sits squarely, and a seat be in front of him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the fractured bones, and let the physician align them until when they are joined with good juncture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and linen bandage, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint over it according to the amount of the place, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a sphere from cloth, and command the sick person to draw it over the fractured foot with their own foot, then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be of leather, in which there be softness, so that the leather is applied to the body of the foot, and tie it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary that you place a splint on top, and another splint underneath on the foot, and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage, as the hand is turned, and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If, however, a fracture of any of the finger joints occurs, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be tied with the foot, and if you wish, place a straight, small splint on it, so that the fracture is raised and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be equalized, and tied with the healthy finger that follows it, or all should be tied according to their continuation, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small splint over it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of the hot abscess itself, and oppose with what is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to the repetition of its account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and is revealed to the senses, because it is turned toward the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done thus, that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person should lie on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then, the attendant should extend every ligament on their side, equally, and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be on the side of the comb, so that the extension falls upwards, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should align the bone with both their hands, until they reduce it to the likeness of its natural shape; and the bone is joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You should wrap a hard bandage, that is, a bind, over the fracture; and double it twice, or three times; and let some excess remain.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints on the thigh at the location of the fracture itself, and place one splint over the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong bandage from the middle over the fracture site, in three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the smaller, softer, and gentler your bandage should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie together, therefore, the three splints that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower part, until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both ends tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the constriction over it, while it remains, so that no ulceration, abscess, or swelling, and similar things, befall the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that sort happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hasten with its solution, and rectify whatever has happened from it completely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces, then it is necessary that you equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, split it over it, and remove it; and treat it with what was previously mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is bound, besides which splints are added to it, as we said in the discussion of the arm and forearm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one to whom it belongs should limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the thigh is bound in fifty days, or a little is added or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fractured kneecap rarely occurs, but it is often subject to abrasion.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture does occur, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is [a fracture] both with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the whole thing stands with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that the parts of it which are broken are to be aligned with the fingers, until they are joined together as much as possible by means of alignment and ease, and workmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made from sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white, and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind tightly above it with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments that we have described in other fractures: like a hot abscess and things like that—so as to apply whatever is appropriate to each incident until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris, and the other thin, and is called the Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And the same types of fractures occur in both, as occur in the two bones of the arm; and therefore its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm is done equally, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are fractured together, the leg is twisted in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is twisted towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is fractured, you will find it lower; and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and the tying of splints according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much bleeding, let the extension be less, and the alleviation by your hand gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed in the leg there is something more difficult in operation than in the arm; and so when you align the splints and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pinewood, such as are used in the making of roofs which are placed under boards, and are made from the palm of a hand: and choose those of which the thickness is small, and neither are they from the smallest; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one a cloth in two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places, from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is prohibited, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in good posture.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a cradle of wood be administered according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed upon it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And very much indeed it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound with it properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with that utmost diligence from the abscess, or swelling, or any other such things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone does indeed not occur.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures of the bones of the foot sometimes occur, and fractures of the toes also occur rarely; and they do not occur to them except for abrasion in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones elevated above one another, then let the sick person place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then, you stand and place your foot upon that which is raised from those bones; afterward, press or tread upon it and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and tow over it; and place a small board beneath the sole of the foot, which shall have two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and the other things it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even, whether they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any fingers are broken, then restore them and make them even according to what I have told you concerning the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint under the finger, according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it; then place under the foot this board that I have told you about, and bind it with a fitting bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its proper size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board at the lower part of the foot; and let it stand upon one end of the board outside the foot, so that it holds in good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you, that you not forget, to consider all that I have said to you concerning the other fractures from accidents that we have mentioned: and apply to every accident that which is proper.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and the bone of the breastbone, and the penis of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it; and let it become like a sphere in the vulva from it.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that wool will emerge, until it becomes like a sphere before the door of the vulva, and the broken opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate; and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it; then let her return to her initial cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with wool, and remain for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pubic region of a man or woman breaks, then administer in its restoration, and its proper alignment, what we have described for the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for those who have some study or use of it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself shows you the right way in restoring it and constricting it in many situations; understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when a man's penis breaks, take a goose's throat and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a bandage of cloth, and let it be wrapped and left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of fractured bones when accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for the one who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as of the hip bone, or of the femur, or similar to these, to be swift and to immediately perform phlebotomy on him: if the conditions for phlebotomy are witnessed, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound discharges blood, then it is necessary to hasten to its excision, and to pulverize powdered zegi upon it if you have no other means available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin restoring the fracture on that same day; and do not postpone it, if no abscess arises.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, a hot abscess arises, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the broken bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary to try to reduce it, and to make it level with your hands with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however, its extension and its levelling with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the amount of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that, it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity he needs for that treatment in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round, and let it have a small thickness so that it does not double up upon compression upon it during the operation; and let it have sharp edges, with a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be at the thickness from its middle to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its pointed, curved end be placed on the prominent bone's end; and drive it with it in one go, until when the bone returns and becomes equal with a certain equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its broken ends are thin, and the instrument does not grasp them well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has a hold on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you cannot reduce them with what we have narrated at all, then cut it with whatever is appropriate for it from the incisions that we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away whatever remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When, therefore, the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds intense pain hurting him after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great help on the infirm person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place over the wound a cerot (or plaster), nor anything in which there is oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered; thus, cut with scissors a hole in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with every precaution not to tighten the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this: and have caused to occur upon their sick either death, or corruption, or züch (i.e., pus).
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, differing from the constriction of the other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear certain bad accidents that we have described, and find pain in a suspended place: then you should not place splints upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages of hard cloth in the place of splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound now beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it befits you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound, and it is not consolidated, nor is pus separated from it, then know that there are small bone splinters there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to examine the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However, remove those splinters which are separated, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them out, and remove them by any means possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound suffers from züch, or ekileten, that is, an eating away, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply to each of these the appropriate treatment from the previous description in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which my discourse should concern, and to which you should direct your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and the help bone, and similar large bones, do not presume to pull it back, for often death results from it; rather, leave it until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, if it seems to you, treat the wound; otherwise, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of a knot at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often happens at the site of a healing fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near the joints, and it disfigures the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the knot is recent, administer to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and put them over the knot in linen, and bind them firmly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage on for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and apply another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a lead plate over it properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the knot has already become hard, and is tight, and necessity quickly demands its removal: then cut above it on its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess, or scrape it with some razors until it is removed, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains after that delicate, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains after that delicate, weak, then this is not so except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is the multitude of loosening of the ligament and its ligation not as it should be, or because of the excess of tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time, or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and their weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is to feed the sick person, and to make their body tender, until the blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently embrocate it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When, in a limb already restored after its healing, crookedness and a prominence of the broken bone, or a knot, occurs; and the shape of the limb is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function; then it is not necessary to accept the opinion of him who believes that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who did that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed this operation is greatly to be condemned, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent, then it is necessary that it be soaked in lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a properly made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take marshmallow root mucilage and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil and plaster it with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take ripe figs and grind them with pigeon dung, and things similar to them that are named among medicines that lessen consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened with constant, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already occurred, become strong, been turned into stone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen, then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous from the knot or bone be cut away with very thin knives; and ease should be administered to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the discourse on dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of any joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is prohibited from its motion, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and grievous injuries to the afflicted.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when any dislocation occurs, one must hasten to its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation along with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to move or extend it during the time of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to phlebotomy of the weak person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bathed in warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And treat every limb with that which will bring it back to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even as preceded by those on fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are seldom dislocated unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places by a small movement, and softened a little.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete, full dislocation, until they are softened to the chest area, until the patient's saliva runs, and they cannot hold it, nor close their mouth, and their tongue is wrapped up with their speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	However, when its dislocation is small, then it returns in many positions by itself with little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	However, if it is a complete, full dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that the attendant should hold the patient's head; and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between his/her mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or insert two of his thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he should balance.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to cleanse his/her jaws and to open them for eating in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should balance the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then apply vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy; nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are balanced, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they are not softened, then place pads of cloth over them, with cerate that is made from wax, and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it gently with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right and left; nor try or be forced to chew anything; rather, let their food be soft, drinkable, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is set, then let them eat what they wish, and be given it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Do not exert themselves on the operation of their mouth during eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at any time, and do not return to their places, then often fevers and constant sweating occur; and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, know that it is a peril, and often the person affected dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inner side, because of its connection with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes to the outside, and this is apparent to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the patient lies on their back, and extends their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then grasp the place with your hand in a firm grasp, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and pads over it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If, however, it should dislocate on any day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and straightened according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, and pads, and a bandage over it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And order the sick person to adhere to rest and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated towards the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus; and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And very much it is dislocated and comes out to the lower part towards the titillicum; especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it emerges in them quickly, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is abundant, it is the contrary of that, namely because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow, or a fall, and the Humerus is apostematized with a hot apostemation, and it is thought because of that, that it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you experience that, until you stand upon certainty of it, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is towards the lower part, toward the tickle: and distinguish between the dislocated Humerus and the healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find among them a manifest diversity, and you find a concavity in the head of the Humerus, and below the tickle, at the touch, the head of the humerus, as if it were an egg: and the infirm person cannot bring the hand to their ear, nor move it in all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed of this dislocation, an easy reduction is made, when it is recent, or the infirm person is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the minister raises his hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under its tickle, and raise the joint with strength upward to its place: and let the minister raise his hand, and extend it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him place it below, for it indeed returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by that which we have said, and there are many days from the beginning when the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the infirm person be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and eases, such as if the roots of althea, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then let the infirm person be laid on their back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under its tickle, which should be equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician place his heel upon the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and draw the hand of the infirm person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another servant hold the head of the infirm person, so that it does not move downwards: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is so that you make present a man who is taller than the infirm person, and let him stand on the side, and insert his shoulder under the tickle of the infirm person: and lift his tickle upwards, until the infirm person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another servant pull the hand of the infirm person downwards toward his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the infirm person is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood be fixed in the earth, whose head is round in shape, like a mortar's sleeve: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let soft cloths be placed over the head of the wood, beneath the infirm person; and let the infirm person stand along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be extended downwards on the other side, and let his body be extended on the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: to which there be a round head, so that its entrance into the depth of the socket may be eased, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the infirm person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the wood beneath the infirm person's socket, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood downwards; and tie the wood over the support, arm, and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the width of a step of a ladder, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entrance is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place a sphere of equal quantity of wool under the socket.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster, made from mill dust with frankincense and egg white, over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind a decent bandage under the socket, and let the ligament be wrapped over the plaster from above, and let his hand be tied to his neck, and let it be left, and let his hand not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the infirm person, until the limb is strengthened, because this is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is placed after seven, or five, days, and it is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint is dislocated many times, due to the moisture that occurs in it, or for some other reason, then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be applied to it, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it several times, and it does not strengthen, and it falls, and cannot elevate itself upwards: then know that its nerves, which are to the head of the humerus, are now cut, or stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, the reduction of a dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the rear, is done with pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns, and further constriction and treatment are applied to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use the bath frequently, until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty; and indeed it is dislocated in all directions, and especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is apparent to the eye and to the touch, regardless of the manner in which it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that is made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and it cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed, especially when it is toward the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and causes them greater pain, and many times death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is from those that can be reduced, is that his hand be extended with two hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should press the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palms, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns thus, that he double his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a forceful, strong extension; and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants also hold it, so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a long doubled cloth or wide bandage is wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it is from those things that aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he shall propel the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster upon it, in which there is astringency and drying with egg white; and a proper bandage must be applied.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint is not properly bound, then apply the plaster and bandage again, and leave it for a few days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	However, if after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs, and the condition is in motion, then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place on the joint a sheep's rump fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bandage it, and leave it over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and immerse it in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply it again, once, and twice, and thrice with the entry into the bath, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it a poultice of cow dung, damp, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For thus it is soothed and returns to its proper state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint between the arm and the hand, the Mahassem, is frequently dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Contrary to the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that speed be used in reducing its dislocation at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes suppurated: or a hot abscess occur in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the hand of the weak Mahassem on a table, and let the attendant extend his hand; and let the physician place his palm on the eminence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand: then let the weak person place the back of his hand on the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be placed inwardly on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand be placed on the table, so that the hand of the physician falls upon the very eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster which quiets the abscess: and leave him, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you succeed in reducing it, after days have passed, but nevertheless the joint remains according to its twisting: and it does no harm to the sick person, except that the hand softens and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been severed or crushed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no remedy for it except that it be cauterized near the site of the injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it will not help anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	Therefore, when the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is to be tied and left for five days; afterward, it is to be loosened and left, and the hand exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however, its movement is prevented, and something serious happens to it, then gently warm it with heated water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm, or its front, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the said account: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do this with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do this with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spine of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a dislocation of the spine of the back, or a complete dislocation of the neck, occurs, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death swiftly approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of this is that the sick person's excretion comes out involuntarily, and they cannot hold it; and often some of their limbs soften, or their two legs, or their two arms, or one of them, or a single vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, and often their removal occurs in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the rear is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, its treatment is that you should consider, if gibbosity occurs from childhood, then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any cure for it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy language.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most does not return with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	However, I have already shortened it from that, of which little excuses itself from a great deal of it from my proximity to the intention: and by my exposition in which I have exposed it, and I have formed its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it, and they exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in gibbosity that occurs from the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is produced on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the infirm person be stretched out on his face on an even platform near a wall: and that moist straw be spread beneath him, so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be fixed in a hole in the ground, at the edge of the platform, about the height of his head; and another piece of wood about the height of his feet at the other edge of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, firm bandage around the head of the sick person, and under his temples; and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is near his head; and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage above his buttocks, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each attendant should extend the bandage to the piece of wood, and the two pieces of wood should not be moved from their fixed positions; however, they should not be secured, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his hands on the vertebra with force, until it returns to its place; or he should place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he ties his feet to the board until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out a space in the wall, of which we have said that it is near the sick person, for the end of the board to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull firmly until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you wish, work with a turning tool held in your hand: and it is, that you fix two pieces of wood in the ground near the sick person's head, at the foot of the platform, each one of which is the length of an arm; and at his head at the foot of the platform, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in each place, through which the turning tool passes; and let every piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and the turning tool is, in which the ligament revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm's breadth along with that which revolves: and in the other two pieces of wood is similarly such.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures that you have tied to the patient's chest with the turning tool which is at his head; and the ligatures that you have tied to his legs with the turning tool which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each turning tool, who shall turn his hand with the strap with which the turning tool revolves; and the physician shall adjust the Spondylus, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning tool, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spondylus returns, and the place is made level, then it is necessary to place a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a bandage.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place on top of the plaster a small board, whose width is of three fingers, or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is a quantity that covers the humped area, and over the healthy part of the Spondylus.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it shall be tied with the bandage that we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use subtle nourishment until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of prominence remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board that we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered on it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the final vertebra of the spine, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not appropriate to presume to give him this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.

Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that dislocation of the shoulder joint, and the humeral joint, does not occur except by complete dislocation; nor does it occur to them as it does to other joints by slight separation and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the shoulder joint is dislocated in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most commonly dislocated inward; and it is rarely dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: because when you join the weak leg to the healthy one, it is longer; and its knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the weak person cannot bend their foot to the groin; and there is a place following the groin that is swollen with a hot abscess, because the hip head has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of someone who has experienced an outward dislocation is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of someone who has experienced a forward dislocation is that the healthy leg expands according to its fullness; however, it does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot move forward on it; and its urine is retained, and its groin becomes inflamed, and during walking, its foot is on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of someone who has experienced a backward dislocation is that the knee does not expand, nor can it be bent before the groin is bent; and the leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the hip head is at the ilium location.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of these types of dislocations is, however, to consider, if the dislocation is old, which has already become established in the affected person.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its position: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary to make a complete presumption for it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in one whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you may wish for the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need another treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and that he extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his kneecaps.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he shall tie with a gentle bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension shall be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be at one time, until the weak person is raised with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every kind that I shall say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its own reduction, indeed, when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the patient be laid on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he shall place a bandage over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin part to the higher part of the body, to the part of the crotch.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong attendant take his arms, and reduce the thick part of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outwards with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this method is easier than the other methods of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if it resists you, and does not obey you for entry with this method of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and let the length of each be from its own match in the quantity of four fingers; and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended over a wooden beam, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to support the head of the thigh; and let him be suspended with the sick person by another young man; and let another young man, supporting the thigh with strength, drive it, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its own return, however, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, according to what we have described in the case of someone with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a bandage is to be tied over his sick leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let a piece of wood be placed in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; upon which let wet cloths be wrapped, so as not to harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every attendant pull in their direction, and the physician adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the board, and press it, just as we said in the case of a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is forward, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be pulled quickly: and it is according to this same account on a platform: and the physician should place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then constrict it with the other hand, and with that constriction place it extended downward toward the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is backward: then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended downward, and raised from the ground: rather, it is necessary that they be placed on a hard object, as is proper, just as it is also done if his hip is dislocated outward, according to what we said about his lying on both hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments stretched out, according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that pressure be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint goes out, when the reduction is completed as is proper.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person: and when you see them equal, and the sick person draws his leg together, and expands it without excuse: then know that the limb is now returned, as is proper: then join the two hips, and apply a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip is not moved to any part: and let the sick person adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore release the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him/her walk slowly on both legs for several days until he/she is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, namely backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And a sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is to make the sick person sit upright, so that he may extend his leg over it if possible, and apply your back to his face, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then cause his knee to adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and cause the leg to adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three, or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person not use walking for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however, its reduction is refused by you, then administer strong extension with ligaments, whose description preceded in the treatment of dislocation, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes removed by a small displacement, and sometimes dislocated according to its full extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And a sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, projecting towards the side to which it has dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is easy to restore: and it is that it should be gently extended with the hands, and brought into alignment, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its treatment however, when it is dislocated to its full extent, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upright; and that a strong assistant holds him firmly at the middle of the back of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you, with your right hand, hold his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot, in the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the foot's chest with the right towards the leg without exertion.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have recounted.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest to the leg on the third turn, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one turn, or in two according to this manner, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however, the reduction of it with what we have recounted is prevented: then cause the sick person to lie on their back on the ground, and fix a firmly planted peg in the ground, so that it falls between their thighs; and you have now wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards, let another attendant extend the foot, either with their hands, or with a bandage that is tied around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every attendant pull against the pull of their counterpart; and let the peg stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards by the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should make the dislocation even with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return to health is shown to you, then place a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too forceful upon them and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, bind it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the weak person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If, however, he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be dislodged again, and be corrupted, and not receive healing after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess should occur to him, then it is necessary that you administer to it that which was previously narrated in our treatise in another place concerning treatment, and a fomentation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be straightened with a slight extension without effort; and indeed, this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some of the dorsal nodes of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person place their foot on an even surface, or on a board; and [he should stand] as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you shall stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see it now straightened, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a board under the sole of his foot that can hold the entire foot, with two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Of the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When anything of that sort happens, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, often death ensues: and therefore it is not proper for anyone to presume to treat such a case unless he is prudent in the art from long experience, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and so that he should use in the beginning only medicines that calm hot abscesses; and should leave the sick person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for safety from destruction with the easing of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that calms the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever desiccant ointments are suitable for it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If, however, the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate protrusions occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do in it what we said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their locations.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my teaching preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body among those in your time.
