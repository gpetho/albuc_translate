Chapter Thirty-Six:
On the cauterization of fistulas that form naturally in certain parts.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described, and the patient is frightened by it, they should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when a person has a fistula in a natural area, and it is old, oozing pus and corrupted humidities, the best approach is to probe it with a thin probe, and then measure the depth of it with the same probe.
Then heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula, according to the depth measured by the probe.
Repeat the cauterization on it until the corrupted tissues are burned away, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
Be careful not to burn nerves or veins; if the fistula reaches the bladder or intestines, avoid those areas; only perform this procedure when the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not deep.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
If the area is sealed and the material has been removed, and it remains this way for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
If the materials are not removed, then know that it is deep or in the cavity of corrupted bone, or due to other causes that will be mentioned in their place.
