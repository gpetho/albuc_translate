Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Scrofulous Swellings that Appear on the Neck. These swellings frequently occur on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins. They may occur on the rest of the body. Those that appear on the neck may be single or multiple, and some of them arise from others.
Each scrofulous swelling has its own membrane, as is the case with lipomas and head swellings, as we have described.  The types of these scrofulous swellings are numerous: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
If you find one that feels healthy to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and is not attached to a neck nerve, vein, or artery, and it is not deep.
Then you should incise it simply from top to bottom of the swelling in this manner from line C to line B.
And dissect it from all sides and retract the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks, or with many hooks if needed, as we have said regarding head swellings, and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
So that your hand does not cut more than intended or the patient moves causing you to cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, put powdered vitriol or some of the styptics that stop bleeding in the wound.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will stop then. Then return to your work until you are finished, then check with your index finger if any other small swellings remain, and cut them out and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the swelling, then you should not cut that swelling from its base, but you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm. Then pack the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire swelling, then you should bring the edges of the wound together and sew it immediately after you know that no remnants of the swelling remain. If you see that remnants of the swelling's base remain.
Then you should aim to cut to its base and root and use stitching and what we have mentioned.  As for swellings containing fluids, lance them gently and superficially where they appear ripe to you and make the lancet from the lower part as we said.
Then, after lancing, use a wick with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
