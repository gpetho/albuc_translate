Chapter sixty-three on incising the fleshy vein and its treatment
Know that incising this testicle is one of the dangers that leads to death in most cases, so we recommend leaving it alone and ensuring safety from it.
I will mention the procedure for it and the types of swelling, and I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies in which the testicles are located, and this may happen for many reasons.
Either from excess sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling is the same as the color of the body, and it has no fluid, and the swelling is hard.
Perhaps the swelling is petrified, its color is like pus, and it has no sensation.
It may also be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as mentioned before, or from a swelling of the veins.
So what is from a swelling of the arteries is known by the dissipation of the swelling if you press it with your fingers, and it should not be touched at all.
As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it dissipates when pressed with the fingers.
This type can be incised, as well as the other flesh, and that is by incising the skin of the scrotum, then extending the testicle upwards and taking it out of the white membrane, and freeing the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tying the vessels, and cutting the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle.
If the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh, then the testicle should be taken out and cut off.
And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, then all of that adhesion should be freed and cut off in a circular cut.
If the growth of the flesh is in the place of the adhesion, which is from behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle taken out as we said.
So, when your work is completed, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
