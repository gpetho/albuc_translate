Chapter fifty-eight on the treatment of urine retained in the bladder	CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT. On the treatment of retention of urine.	0.7803404
The urine retained in the bladder is due to its blockage from a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or growing flesh, and so forth.	Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.	0.8486781
So if you treat that with the types of treatment described in the classification that we mentioned, and the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is from a stone that has become lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is appropriate to make the patient kneel on his knees, squatting. Then a man rides on his back and extends his belly to his back, and the patient holds himself as much as he can, thus forcing the neck of the bladder to push the stone backwards, so the urine is released.	When you have carried out treatment in the ways we have prescribed in their place and the urine is not released; and when you see that it is held back by a stone sticking in the neck of the bladder, then you should have the patient down on his knees, squatting; then mount a man on his back to press his abdomen against his back; and let the patient himself hold his breath as tightly as possible; for then pressure will be put on the neck of the bladder to force the stone back and liberate the urine.	0.83634067
But if it is not released by what we mentioned, and the matter intensifies for the patient, it is appropriate to resort to extracting it with the instrument called a catheter, which is pictured here:	But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure.	0.8131196
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like the tube of a bird's feather in the thinness of the الميل, long about a span and a half, and has a delicate funnel at its head.	It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.	0.8778801
And the way to draw urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie at its end wool or cotton with a good knot and insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube, plugging it like a button.	This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel.	0.80522144
Then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and sit the patient on a chair and anoint his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water.	Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white. Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water.	0.9140029
Then insert the catheter gently into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it until the urethra is bent, then push the catheter inwards until, when it reaches near the anus, tilt the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that it has reached something empty, and it is made in this manner because the passage in which the urine flows is crooked.	Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra. Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat. Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow. The reason why the operation is done in this manner is that the passage by which the urine is excreted is curved.	0.9240073
Then pull the thread with the wool gently, for the urine will follow the wool. Then take it out and the urine will pour out.	Then withdraw rather firmly the thread with the wool plug attached, for the urine follows the wool; then pull it right out and the urine will pour out.	0.89071536
And reinsert the catheter and continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.	Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	0.8516779
