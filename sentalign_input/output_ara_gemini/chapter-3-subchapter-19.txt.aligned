Chapter nineteen on the reduction of bone fractures if they are with a wound.	CHAPTER NINETEEN. On the repair of fractures accompanied by wounding.	0.6782415
It is advisable for one who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, to immediately phlebotomize him at the time, if the conditions for phlebotomy are met, as we have previously mentioned.	When a man has a compound fracture, especially when it is a large bone such as the femur or humerus or the like, you should at once venesect him if the conditions are suitable for venesection as set out above.	0.8369346
If the wound is bleeding, then you should hasten to stop it by sprinkling powdered vitriol on it, if you have nothing else available.	If there is bleeding from the wound you must hasten to stanch it by sprinkling it with powdered vitriol if you have nothing else at hand.	0.928474
Then proceed to set the fracture on that very same day and do not delay it unless a hot swelling occurs.	Then begin on the reduction of the fracture the very same day; do not put it off unless an abscess occur.	0.8512316
If a hot swelling occurs, leave the setting of the fracture until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for bad symptoms may arise.	But if an abscess does occur, leave the reduction until the ninth day so that the abscess may subside, and in no circumstances touch it on the third or fourth day, for you will bring evil consequences on him.	0.8094971
If the broken bone is protruding from the skin and exposed, you should attempt to reduce and align it with your hands gently and with a slight extension.	If the fractured bone be overriding the skin you must try to reduce it and to straighten it out by hand, gently and with moderate extension.	0.8935748
If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, its length being about seven or eight fingers and its width according to the size of the wound. Therefore, the physician should acquire three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture.	If reduction and straightening by hand is unsuccessful, then reduce it with this instrument; it is made of iron, seven or eight fingers' breadths long, and wide in proportion to the size of the wound; that is why the doctor should have three or four of them in the sizes he may need for treating every kind of fracture.	0.9255855
And let it be rounded with a slight thickness so that it does not bend when pressed upon during the operation, and let it have a sharp end with a hook at its tip, its upper part being thick and from its middle to the bottom very thin.	It should be round and somewhat thick so as not to bend when pressure is put upon it at the time of operating. It should be sharp-ended with a bend at the end; the upper part should be of some thickness, but from the middle to the lower part it is a good bit thinner.	0.81767917
And this is its image:	This is its form.	0.640175
And it is called in Greek "peron" meaning a small lever.	It is called in Greek bayram, meaning a small lever.	0.7528291
It is necessary that its sharp, curved end be placed on the protruding end of the bone, and push it with it at once, so that when the bone returns and is somewhat leveled, then level the ends of the fracture on each other.	You must place the sharp incurved end of it over the end of the protruding bone, and push it firmly with it. When the bone is repositioned and straightened in some measure, try to straighten the ends of the fracture, one to another.	0.8515839
If its broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, it is necessary to cut the end of that bone so that the instrument can grip it.	If the fractured end be very thin and the instrument does not grip it firmly you will have to cut off that end so as to give purchase for the instrument.	0.8380835
If you are absolutely unable to reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with something similar to the cutters that we mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws however you can.	If you cannot reduce the bone at all by the means we have described, cut it off with any of the osteotomes we have mentioned that is suitable, or saw it off with one of the saws as best you may.	0.85221577
Then scrape off what remains on the bone of roughness and thin scales.	Then strip away any remaining roughness of the bone and fine pieces of shell.	0.8632971
If you reduce the bone and the patient finds, after its reduction, severe and harmful pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.	If, when you have reduced the bone, the patient feels severe and troublesome pain, you may know that the bone has not returned to its natural site.	0.87630343
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.	If you can restore it to its natural site, do so, for you will render the patient a signal service.	0.80333894
When you have completed your setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if you are in the summer, and do not put on the wound a cerate nor anything containing fat, lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it.	When your setting of the bone is complete, soak a dressing in dark sharp wine, especially if it be in summer, but do not put wax or anything oily upon the wound lest it cause putrefaction or corruption.	0.8715217
Then use splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound, and beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for ignorant doctors often do that, causing their patients either death or gangrene or inflammation; and let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of the rest of the fracture.	Then apply splints the moment you have finished setting the bone; and leave the wound open, that is, by making with scissors an opening in the coverings the size of the wound. And take the utmost care not to bandage up a wound with a fracture; for many ignorant doctors have done that, thereby causing their patients either death or ulceration or a defluxion; so make your bandage soft and loose, as opposed to that of other fractures.	0.9009226
If the wound is bad, or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms that we have described, and he finds disturbing pain in the place, it is not necessary to put splints on it; make for it bandages of hard cloths in the place of the splints and tighten it with them.	If the wound be severe or of great size and you fear for it some one of the grave accompaniments such as we have described, and the patient feels a disturbing pain at the place, then you should not put on splints; but instead of splints make wrappings of a stiff material and bind them on.	0.87353325
If it is after a day or two and you see that pus has begun to generate in the wound, remove the cloth that you put on it with the drink, then use the threads and ointments that we are accustomed to treat wounds with, such as the quadruple ointment and the like.	If, after one or two days have passed, you see that the wound is beginning to suppurate, remove the dressing with wine that you had put on it, and then apply the pads and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds, such as Tetrapharmacon ointment and the like.	0.82521296
It is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and inspect the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and recovers.	Every evening and morning you will have to loosen the bandaging and carefully examine the wound until it knits and is healed.	0.8574601
It is necessary to position the limb in a way that the pus flows down from it easily.	You must also place the limb in such a position as to let the pus flow down easily.	0.82265896
If many days pass for the wound and it does not heal and the pus does not stop from it, know that there are small bone fragments there, so it is necessary to search the wound with a probe, and whatever of those fragments are loose, extract and remove them, and whatever of them are not loose and are pricking the limb and causing pain, then cut and extract them in every way you can.	If, after many days, the wound is unhealed and it goes on suppurating, you may know that there are some little fragments of bone there; so you will have to examine the wound with a probe; and those fragments that are loose take and extract; and those that are not loose but nevertheless pierce the limb and cause pain, attempt to cut them out and extract them by whatever means you can.	0.9005866
If inflammation or gangrene or another type of corruption and putrefaction occurs to the wound, it is necessary to address each symptom of it with something similar to the treatment that was previously described in its chapter.	If a defluxion or ulceration or other kind of corruption or putrefaction happen to the wound, you must meet all these occurrences with the proper remedy described before in its place.	0.78500205
And among what you should pay attention to my words and keep in mind is if a large bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur bone, the humerus bone, and the like of the large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or remove it, for death often results from that, rather leave it until it putrefies, for it may fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days, then at that time treat the wound if you see a place for treatment in it, otherwise leave it.	One thing that is necessary is that you should comply with my words and keep them in mind: when a large bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur, the humerus, and the other bones of the long limbs, do not meddle with pulling or extracting it, for this often causes death; but leave it to suppurate. It may come away of itself in twenty or thirty days. Then dress the wound if you find occasion; if not, let be.	0.89663374
