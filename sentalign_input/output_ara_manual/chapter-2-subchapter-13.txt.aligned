The condition that causes this ectropion is called "hare eye." This ectropion can be either congenital or acquired. The acquired type results from the healing of a wound, tear, cauterization, or something similar.	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e. hareeye). Now sometimes this inversion is natural, sometimes acquired. It is acquired either from the cicatrization of an injury, or an incision, or cauterization, or the like.	0.7420461
The way to treat it is to incise the scar tissue, separate its edges, insert a linen wick between them, and tie it until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed. In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.80806124
If you do that, the ectropion will return worse than it was. Rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek, and fomentation with water in which marshmallow root and flaxseed have been steeped, and diachylon ointment melted with some oil, and smear it on the wick and treat it with it.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.75042033
The key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal in the way it was originally. This procedure that we have mentioned is only a partial correction of the ectropion, not that the appearance of the area will return to exactly how it was.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before. This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.8009742
