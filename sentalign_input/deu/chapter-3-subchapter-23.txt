Chapter XXIII
On the discussion of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, preventing movement, and deforming the shape of the limb, causing the patient great pain and injury.
So when a dislocation happens to someone, it must be immediately forced back, and not delayed, because if delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and very soon it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.
Therefore, it should not be handled or stretched during the time of inflammation, because it often causes spasms and severe pain.
But when this happens, you must quickly perform bloodletting on the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be treated with warm water and oil, and it will be easily reduced.
And every limb should be treated with the remedies appropriate for it, as will be described in their respective chapters.
And I have already organized the chapters on dislocation as preceded by the chapters on fractures; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowest part.
