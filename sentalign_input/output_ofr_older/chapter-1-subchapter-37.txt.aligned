of kidney disease When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from thick winds, and he has no desire for women, then make a cautery on the kidneys on both sides with the clavile cautery as mentioned earlier; and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, which will be more helpful.	On cauterization of the kidneys. When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before. I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.7370087
