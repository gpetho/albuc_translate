Chapter Three.
On Bone-Setting.
This chapter is also among the most essential things needed in the practice of medicine, and it is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is also claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a word of it.
For this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country, and I have never met anyone at all who is proficient in it.
I have only learned from it what I have learned through long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses.
And my experience with it has passed, after I have brought it closer to you and purified it from the branches of prolixity, and abbreviated it to the utmost brevity, and clarified it to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.
As it increases clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.  And there is no power except in God, the Most High, the Great.
