Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I completed for you, oh sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its complement, and I reached the end in it, from its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation by hand has been neglected in our region and time, and has been completely abandoned; until perhaps its science has perished and its track has been cut off, and nothing of it remains except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitation occurred to them, until its intentions were closed and its use was prolonged. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the composition of this Treatise concerning it, according to the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation, and that I should come with the forms of cauterization and the rest of the instruments of work, with the addition of declarations and the preparation of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason for which a good artisan of it with his hand is not found in our time, is: that the art of medicine is long, and its author ought to exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the functions of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has cognition of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their going out, and the pulses of the veins, and the quiet ones, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about this at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we said concerning anatomy, does not understand, and already falls into error, by which men are harmed: just as I have seen many of them, who boast about this science, and throw themselves into it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened is that I saw a physician make an incision into a scrofulous aposteme on the neck of a woman and he cut certain arteries in the neck, from which the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man which had progressed in his bladder, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore approached him, and extracted it with a fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	For which the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the weak man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he got a fracture in his leg near the heel, and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and pressed the fracture above the wound with poultices, and applied a tight bandage, and did not allow the wound an expiration.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he treated him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for several days and instructed him not to undo the bandage, and it remained thus until his leg became an aposteme and his foot, and it reached a state of destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him, and I hastened to undo the bandage, and tranquility followed, and he was relieved from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Truly the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread through the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous aposteme, and it became an ulcer after some days, until the evil of it was increased with the lord of the patient.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, that when it is pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it is not suitable to be pierced with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it can be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation to which health is associated, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up in every place of this book, where the operation comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	For it is necessary for you to beware of that, and dismiss it: so that the stupid ones do not find a way to speak and to discredit.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and your weak ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way, obtaining grace from God for salvation and praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible distresses of difficult healing: and lift your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation enters into your faith and your commodity.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more elevated in this world, and afterwards to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in certain of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat the evil disease: lest you be named bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	The first Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and sharp medicine, the chapter, and ordered from head to foot, and forms of instruments, and iron tools of cauterization: and all that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	The second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and piercing, bloodletting and puncture, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to that: and the whole chapter, ordered with forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Of restoration and dislocation and the cure of torsion and similar things to it: chapters, arranged from head to foot, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of cauterization and the nuisance of cauterizing: and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I mention the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its cauterizations and its nuisances: and in which complexions they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of cauterization and its nuisance is a discourse complex and subtle, of science and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have also spoken about it and disagreed on it: and for myself I am satisfied with few of their discourses, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that cauterization is suitable universally for every complexion, which is with matter and without matter: excepting two complexions, which are a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In the hot and dry complexions with matter they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that cauterization is suitable for them.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite of that, namely that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable, that a hot and dry illness be healed with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: that through cauterization healing is done in every hot and dry illness which occurs in the bodies of men: since when you compare the body of a man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I say this through his speech: that from the experiment he has already shown me that several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not fitting that he should proceed with that, unless he has already been tested and practiced in the chapter of Cautery's final exercise, and has recognized the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of their illnesses, and the causes of them, and the accidents of them, and the span of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the remaining complexions, however, there is no fear regarding use: and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have already agreed on these, and they do not disagree with the judgment of using Cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know this, my sons, that the secret of curing by Cautery with fire, and its goodness over Cautery with burning medicine is that the fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined to it, except with a little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of the burning medicine penetrates to that which extends from the members: and perhaps it makes happen in a member an illness difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	The fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with art, and staying on the truth of things: and because of that I will excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would tell you a secret occult in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of expelling, which expels illnesses, explained by philosophical speech, which would be sharpened in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you should know what they themselves disagree about at the time when a cauterization is to be made, and they put on a better time for the chest.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cauterization is suitable at every time, because the harm that occurs on account of the time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is on account of necessary pains and strong, violent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because there is fear of a greater evil happening from them, than the small harm that occurs on account of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it fall into your minds, O sons, that which only the common and foolish physicians think, namely that for the ailment which is healed by a cauterization, there is not always a relapse: and they put that as a consequence, and the thing is not as they suppose: because the cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and evacuates the humors which are the causes, from which the pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Truly, however, the cauterization surpasses medicine by the speed of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the ailment returns at some hour of time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of its ailment, and its virtue: and what is prepared in his body from an aggregation of superfluities in it: and what pervades to it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless the ailment is made, in which the cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle ailment in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as the cauterization of a tooth, on account of pain, and similar things to it, it is possible that the pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that suits few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	And the common speech of the people is that cauterization is the last resource of medicine, which is a true speech, not for that which they themselves intend in it: since they believe that there is no cure which agrees with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of the cauter.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the thing is contrary to this, and the intention that cauterization is the last resource of medicine is not so, except that when we administer methods of cure in some diseases, and those medicines do not work: then we administer cauterization at the end, and it works: thence it follows that cauterization is the last resource of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the loftiness of its substance: and they said that it does not produce pus in the place of the cauter.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But it is not true absolutely: since I have already proven that, and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However when you make a cauter of gold in the fire, it is not shown to you when it is ignited according to the quantity that you need, because of the redness of the gold: and when it attains its full heat, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Wherefore the artisan fails from that in his work: and because of this iron cauter is made by us more quickly and nearer to perfection for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this Chapter on Cauterization, according to the chapters: and arranged them from head to foot: so that they may alleviate whoever seeks what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the method of cauterizing the head in a coronal commissure.
Caput II.	Head II
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is beneficial for dominating humidity and coldness above the brain: which two are the causes of numbness, and the multitude of flux of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat ache: and universally all illness that occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and numbness, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar to those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should first prepare the weak: so that it may be evacuated in the beginning with a medicine that cleanses and purifies the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the weak person demands, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command them to shave their head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make them sit between your hands, with their hands placed on their chest, so that they have already put their hands on their breast.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then put the root of your palm on the root of their nose between their eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger touches, mark that place with an incision or branding iron.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then prepare the cauterization of olive oil: whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then put it on the marked place with the incision, while your hand contracts slowly, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and inspect the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has already drawn out from the bone a quantity of head alkali, or a quantity of theriac, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, return your hand with the iron itself, or with another one by itself if it cools: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton in it, and apply it to the place; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then apply over it cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the eschar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment tetrapharmacon, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	For they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus, which is better and of greater benefit.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone, and that the cauterization should be applied until it reaches something of the thickness of bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to pierce through with a cauterization iron to the extreme, until it impresses on the bone an impression of a fetid smell, so that the bone falls away, which is formed like a crater: or an instrument that women put in the infusion of the alphabet of the puerperal: and they extract, what they exhale from this place vapors of the head, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be treated, until it becomes consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two types of cauterization do not seem suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And leaving it alone is better for me with its own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head is weak by nature: and a certain species of Cauterization is more salutary and better for me, and I use it: therefore I operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Of the method of cauterizing the head for pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the weak person, and it is treated with henna, and cichorium, and head purges, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with a single cauterization that we have described, and none of those things are of benefit to it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the weak person is of strong natural creation, and it is not feeble, and it finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cauterizer under that a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it itself over every horn of its head with a cauterizer, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity is discovered from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it itself with a single cauterizer on the back of its head, in the place that is called "uas", and it is the place where the ventouse is put: and raise your target in this, and do not discover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak person finds relief because of that vehement pain, and it is different from the pain of the other cauterizations of the whole head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cauterization is in its own place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterizer, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput more subtly than the cauterizer with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing in half of the skull, both with a medicine burnt, and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is treated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the rest of the treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is administered, and none of those things are of benefit: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with medicine burnt by fire, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with a sharp caustic medicine is such that you take one tooth of a badger, and scrape it, and cut off its extremities on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a broad lancet, until a place is made under the skin, in which the dens is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it therefore under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind over it with a bandage of decent constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; then untie it, and extract the badger, and leave the wound two days, or three; afterwards put on it a plaster submerged in butter, until the place makes pus: then cure it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make it with certain sharp medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on caustic medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cauterization, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is named a Clavulus: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in the middle of it is a certain small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it on the place, and hold your hand: and you withdraw the iron little by little with swiftness: and let the quantity that is cauterized be from the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not cauterized, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the plaster in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days: then put a plaster with butter: afterwards cure it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you want, cauterize this half of the skull with the edge of a second cauterizing knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of the incision of an artery in this half of the skull, not formerly its own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat hemicrania, with what we said from the preceding cure, and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work: and you see from the disease that what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire is not enough for it, then it is necessary to make a burning cauterization, until it becomes white after you apply a sign above the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put your hand in place of one, and press it until you cut an artery, and penetrate up to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Truly it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, whence spasms happen.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is above caution, and warning about the flow of blood from an artery which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent, nor experienced: and he gives up the operation with that at the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the management of the flow of blood which happens from an artery according to its mode, and in the proper place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the disease that this cauterization is not enough for it, and you see the weak body tolerating a cauterization on the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you use it, administer the cauterization that we said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then cauterization by fire: and this is what is called a point, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then puncture with it after its ignition around the entire ear, as it revolves: or around both, if pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch yourself with the cauterizing instrument from the root of the ear for a short while, after you have marked the place with ink, and let the quantity of cauterization be ten punctures on all the ear, or thereabouts.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing for Twisting.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Twisting that is treated with cauterization, is not unless from species which occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And it demands cauterization of the species that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of twisting with hienas, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak place with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur, except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cauterizing instrument at the top extremity of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is a species from a knife, whose form is previously described: nevertheless it is not more subtle than that little, as you see: and it should be a knife with a bit of superfluous thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then heal the place, with what has preceded, until it is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the Apoplexy has become old and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the weak person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cauterization on the back of the head, according to what has preceded: and the method of the cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And it is also cauterized with a Cautery over the bone of the stomach: and this is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then let it be cured, with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that at first the weak person should be given to drink great draughts, and cleansing pills for the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the weak person, and put on its back a plaster of the snail described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of the Cautery: and do that according to the same order which I have mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is cured by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back part of his head, which extend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization, with what has preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If indeed you use an application, and he is weak and cannot tolerate it: then apply a cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	What if you use an application: then cauterize it over the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat it, until it is healed: and let the cauterization be according to the form that has been described beforehand.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterizing for paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is fitting that you proceed with the cleansing of the head with care, and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the weak person: afterwards cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization over every horn of the head, and with a cauterization over its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If indeed you immerse in the disease of softening of the body many of them, and he is weak and cannot tolerate it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cauterization, until it is greatly burned from its skin, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat it, until it is healed: and thus the cauterization of olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cauterizing for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	The epileptic is not cauterized, unless it is one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary therefore that you cleanse his brain first with care, and with the rest of the treatment which we have spoken of in division: when the weak person is great, or is tolerant of the reception of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If indeed he is a boy, who does not tolerate medicines, then administer a gargle, and cleansing mastics for the brain, before that for many days with a strengthening of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cauterization in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded in manner: and cauterize another on his occiput, and over every horn of his head with a cauterization.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	What if he is weak and unable to tolerate, then cauterize him with the cauterizations that I mentioned in one having palsy, and softening of the body on the spondiles of the neck, and the spondiles of the back: and let the cauterization be olive oil according to the method which has preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If however he is a weak child, then apply a subtle cauterization, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and gross phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauterizations that we mentioned in one having palsy.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a surplus of declivity to melancholy, and the body of the weak is moist, then give him in drink what will cleanse his brain, according to that which has preceded in division: then shave the head of the weak, and afterwards make a tortella skillfully made from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put it on the middle of the head: and let the weak person sitting squarely be held from every side.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply an ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is worthy made from old butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with tempered heating to a measure that the finger can tolerate, when it is inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then apply it on the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do that to the weak person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you use it, apply a cautery to it making many small points, besides which you should hold the hand with the cautery and smell it.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	This type of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then put on top of it a cotton pad soaked in butter or hen's fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	On the method of applying a cautery to the descending water of the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of the water in the eye is declared to you by signs, which I mentioned in the division, then begin and drink the weak one, with what purifies its head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard it from all moistures, and make it sit in a bath, in fasting for some days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command it to shave its head, and apply a cautery to the middle of its head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then apply a cautery to it on the two temples with two cauteries, if there is a descending water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is a water in one eye: and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long across the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	What if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of the arteries, and cutting them, and caution from the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries produced from the back.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	On the method of applying a cautery to old tears.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and constant: and they are above the veins and arteries which are in the manifest head exteriorly, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then apply a cautery with the same cautery that I narrated for the descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you notice an increase, then cauterize it on every side with a cautious eye, above the eyebrow with a small cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the method of cauterizing in the nostrils.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective then hasten and give in drink a weak potion for three nights then shave his head and cauterize it with a moderate cauterizer with an olive oil cauterizer.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a clamp-like cauterizer, with two cauterizers, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of the clamp-like cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing for softening of the Eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or moisture then cauterize the eyelid with one cauterizer, with this crescent-shaped cauterizer.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauterizers on every side and they will stretch out from both temples and let the length of every cauterizer be according to the lengths of the eyebrow and do not extend your hand with the cauterizer, but according to the quantity that is burned by the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cauterizer according to this method of the crescent-shaped cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when inverted lashes prick the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterization is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	With the fire cauterizer, however, instruct the weak one beforehand, that he let his eyelashes fall out, if he is one of those who clean them, until they become longer and even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they then prick him at his own throat: then bind his eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move, until they are healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore the ulcers have formed and levelled, then put the head of the weak person in your bosom: afterwards mark over the eyelid of his eyes with a caustic, a mark which is according to the shape of myrtle leaves: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a cloth dipped in vinegar on the white of the eye: or in a mucilage of psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure that you marked little by little on many a vein, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of myrtle leaves, appearing wholly proper.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and hairs elevated at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it as often as the weak person feels the biting of the medicine: for its biting penetrates like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore it persists, what it itself has found, the biting, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting has ceased, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid lifted, as it is lifted with contraction from fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then apply again on it medicine on the place where the medicine does not press and does not blacken, until your operation is equal, and the eye is contracted.

Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be hollow, like the shape of a quill pen from one end, with which cauterization is done, and if you want it to penetrate to the other end, and if you want it raised thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this hollow one is better for your work.

And hold your hand for a short time with the cauterization instrument near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand is not tremulous, nor the weak person disturbed, and you put the cauterization instrument in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If I perforate at the beginning of your cauterization up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.

When the toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or worm in it, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then cauterization on it is according to two methods: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cauterization of it with butter is, that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take the scum, and apply it to the extremity of the affected tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then dip it into the boiling butter: and put it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire penetrates to the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, dip a thread, or scum into cold butter, and put it on the painful tooth: and place over it a heated iron, until the fire penetrates to the deep part of the hollow tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization of it with fire is, that you apply to a bronze or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be in its body something of thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not penetrate to the weak tooth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the fire cauterization, which shape comes: and put it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cauterization cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is suitable in the application of that cauterization, that it should fill the weak bone with good pus, and hold it for one hour; then it will spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.

Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke can exit from the cauterization at the other extremity: and put the ignited thing over the aposteme once, and a second time, if you need it, until it penetrates to the depth of the aposteme.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	Which if the aposteme is small: then put the cauterization according to the quantity of the aposteme.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and put on top of it a plaster made with butter, until the burnt material is removed by the fire.

Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the arm is dislocated due to a cause of humidities, and it does not return to its place in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it dislocates from a slight movement, which happens as we have already shown, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then let the weak person lie on his back, or on his healthy side.

When there occur in the stomach many colds and humidities, until they extract it from its combination, and multiply the catarrhs to it, and assiduous methods of cure, and do not strengthen: then it is necessary that the weak person lies on his back, and stretches out his legs, and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauterizations, one cauterizer under the shoulder of the chest the size of one finger, with a shoulder cauterizer, and two cauterizations below by the two sides of one cauterizer, until the figure of the cauterizations comes in a triangle.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And let it stretch between both so that they do not join, when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be a quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.

Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of what is cauterized be from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added: and let the weak person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, who has already extended his legs and lifted his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of a cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware, lest you proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, where the whole body is burned, and it penetrates to the intestines: for the skin there is subtle, therefore know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing apostems of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there is a flow of matter, and you want to know if that apostem is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a weak pain and heaviness come on without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is vehement sharpness: and you see already, which has wearied the physicians with its cure.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak man breathes upon his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure the place of the apostem with a searing cautery: then ignite a cautery that is similar to a radius.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it penetrates to the siphac, until all the sanies come out: then cure it with the cure of flowing ulcers, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this species of cautery be used, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these diseases run with experiment many times: then therefore he dares to undertake an operation of this kind.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But to omit it, is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in the Pleura.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, a cautery with the roots of aristolochia for a cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the roots of the dry long aristolochia, one root which is longer, that is found on it, and let it be the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at what is between the junction of the jaw and the neck, and with two small cauteries under the guidance of a little declining towards the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries at what is between the fifth and sixth ribs, declining towards the back a little: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries at the back: one at what is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, but rather that it be on the manifest skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron like a probe: and they ignite it, and insert it inside between the ribs, until they reach with it to the same abscess, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the chapter on Abscesses.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we have said about curation in the division of illnesses, and your treatment is not effective, then a cautery on it is according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, that you make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of Epatus, whose figure has preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between the cauterization a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterization be that which we have mentioned in the cauterization of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterizer, and let the patient lean weakly on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: as we have said in the chapter on the dislocation of the shoulder, that there are two cauteries for the ignias, and raise the skin which is in line with the spleen, where the weak left elbow meets: and let your elevation be such that you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two ignited cauteries by force, until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cauterizer: thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterizer having three rods.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care that the cauterization, after you apply it, discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all the rest that have preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Of the method of cauterizing in Dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterization does not fall into Dropsy, except for the hardened ascleros.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical person with the methods of cure which we have mentioned in the division, and the cure is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cauterizer on the stomach, and another cauterizer on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the shoulders, and one in line with the breast, and another in line with the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cauterization be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then diminish the open cauterization so that it emits pus over a long period.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And it does not evacuate the weak from cure after cauterization with it, for which two intentions are required to be added to it: and the healing will hasten with the aid of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized, should be a clamp, according to the form that preceded it: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be an olive, according to the form that preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When there are apostemations on a hydropic patient, and they are filled with citrine water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocturnal, which is between the ear and the ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water will flow out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on the two legs two cauteries, one on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the extremity of a knife-shaped cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, around the middle of the leg: and on every hip make two cauteries: and diminish the open cautery without cure for a long time: so that some water flows out from it: then cure it with the remaining things that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing for the relief of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly from cold and humidities, until it debilitates the retaining and digesting virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and not healed: and you see the weak tolerating the cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize it with a great cautery on its stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a ring-shaped cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clamp-shaped cautery: and a great cautery above the hips, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures and the weak tolerance of that, then cauterize it with a cauterizing iron on the chest, and cauterize all of it with a cauterizing iron: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a profitable treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauterizations above the lower vertebra of the back under the almeidati for a short time in a triangular fashion, and cauterize under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in pimples, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterizing iron, according to what came before: and cauterize on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a cauterizing iron on the hip: and leave the cauterized place open for some time: then treat him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing the tonsils after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise the tonsils, then ignite a cauterizing iron that resembles a staff.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited iron into the excised tonsil: and with your last hand, until the cauterizing iron reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood runs: do that once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many tonsils, then cauterize each one with a cauterizing iron according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what constricts them from ointments until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cauterization on the alcatin, it is the greatest in treatment of the injury.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the weak one does not undergo the operation and treatment that we described in its own place, and is deterred by it, perhaps it will be healed with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and it becomes chronic, corrupt pus runs out of it, and rotten moistures.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is more worthy therefore that which ought to be, that you should probe it with a subtle sound.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cauterization iron, which is similar to a probe.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited instrument itself into the same fistula and the quantity in which the nail entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat over it the cauterization, until all those rotten bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of the burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of the large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is closed, and matter is cut off from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then know that it is already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a rotten mouth, or something like that: whose reminder will come into its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidney.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or gross flatulence and it weakens because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the alumethen over the kidneys, with a cauterizing iron over each kidney, using an iron clamp, whose description has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time on the same alumethen.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Three lined scars appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more in the lower part of the back.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When debility occurs in the bladder and softening from cold and humidities, until it does not retain weak urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the sumen above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and with a cauterizing iron to the right of the sumen, and another to the left of it: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the quantity of a knot of the thumb: and cauterize it with an inferior back cauterizing iron, or two cauterizing irons, if you need them: and let it be according to what preceded, the clavicular cauterizing iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidities occur in the womb and it is prohibited from pregnancy because of that, and its menses are corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and pain occurs to it at their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauterizing irons around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cauterizing iron above the inferior back, or two cauterizing irons: and let the cauterizing iron be clavicular.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing an ankle in a state of dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous humidities are poured out at the ankle joint, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that one leg is prolonged over the other, when they are compared to each other: and the place of dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the weak part over the ankle joint itself with a similar circular cauterization: after which you mark with a branding iron around the circumference of the joint, as it turns: and so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterization be one whose shape was described previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterization is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, with a large olive-shaped cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and its causes are cold and humidities: and it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you loosen the weak part from gross humors with foul-smelling pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization for it is according to two methods: either cauterization with adhering medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is, that you cauterize over the ankle joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make for them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all cautery be of the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be of olive.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes indeed the cauterization is made in the middle on the head of the same ankle.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	There are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you apply a cauterization with a circle, whose form has preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, one: so that the little circle contains the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the ankle itself, and does not extend to the hip and thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the hip, above the place to which that weakness points, in which is the pain, and your cauterization above the haunch four fingers towards the woody part for a little while: and let the cauterization be of a knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	Which if the weakness indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where it points with a cauterization of one point, or three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if it points to pain being under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in every cauterization of yours, that you do not touch with the cauterization to the point that you burn a nerve, or a large artery, and drag through it above the weak nuisance evil, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the haunch, and finished in cauterization, and the thigh was inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there occurred a loosening of the bowel, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	What if there is pain in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the ankle, that the manner of this cauterization is thus.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a drill similar to an iron one, whose diameter is half a palm, and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less: and inside that drill let there be a third drill.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between all the drills be by the quantity of a thumb knot: and let the drills be open on two sides: and let their height be as a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle from iron decently fitted to the drills.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be ignited in fire, until it becomes red, and throws out sparks: then let it be placed upon the weak ankle, reclining on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize it therefore with three round cauterizations in one place.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply a plaster with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, we have used this type of cauterization little, on account of the terror of its appearance: and because we find few who dare to undertake it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauterizations for him who suffers it, and finds with it its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization with adhering medicines is, that you make two drills having a perforated armlet, into which descends a hinge of its door made from brass or iron, the length of a wall: of which in height there are two knots, or about that.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space which is between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and let it be open below and above: and let that which they contain be next to one another, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it upon the axle of the instrument, while the weak part lies on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly upon the axle of the instrument.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles from warm water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for the quantity of an hour's time: and let the weak part tolerate its biting and burning, for it itself finds the biting as fire, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the entire axle with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put upon it butter, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for some days, and pus will be cured from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last in joining.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	What if the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make for it a plaster that contains water, according to what you did equally with the axle.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take of alkaline substance and unslaked lime each one part: grind both, and put them in a new flask, whose lower part is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that the radius can enter: and put under the bottom of the flask another flask: and throw upon the alkaline substance and lime sweet water, which submerges both by a finger: after which you press it with your hand with good compression: and leave the flask until sharp water descends in the lower part of the flask.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and pour it over another lime, and boil, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strongly sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Since it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which they cauterize, also such as tesie and mel of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both may be mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen told of a certain man of the ancients, whose cure was such that it cured the pain of the hip and the vein of the thigh: and he declared its value to be great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need another cure, and that he was healed by one means, until he told that he perhaps entered a warm bath, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that it be taken from the juice of the green, and if the green is not found, let the dry recent one be taken, and let much of it be rubbed with some fat, and put on the hip, where there is pain, or the leg, or in the hip, and let it be tied, and left for the quantity of three hours, or as long as he feels a weakening of the sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes very sweaty, put him into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain returns, and is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to use a cauterization with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that the dung of capers, when with it the vein of the thigh is cauterized, is of service to it: and makes a cauterization in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and put on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry dung of a goat and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put it on a cloth and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do that until the sensation is felt up to the knee and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the cauterization of the cow.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Of the cauterization of pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and humid matter: and cauterization is not suitable, except in this single case, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after the evacuation of the weak with fetid pills, and similar things, so that they are made on the back, where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the alum treatment itself, afterwards you mark with a cautery on each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which comes from the tolerance of the weak by virtue of it: and let the cauterization be done with cauterized points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with a medial clavicular cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Of the method of cauterizing for the cure of gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often happens to small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is: that it happens with a constriction in breathing at the time of elevation and movement: and you find on the last vertebra of the back and its knot, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When I raise that and make it a tool, then I cauterize it with a cauterizer which is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cauterization take hold equally over every part of the vertebrae: and if you cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cauterizer two or three lines: and let the points be close to one another.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply the cauterizer on the hump that forms during a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for gout and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humidities that flow to whichever members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call that specifically gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout caused by cold is being treated with methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then the cauterizer removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauterizers: and let the cauterizer be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you indicate that there are points on the surface of the foot, then make with the cauterizer points.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	Which if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and it often happens, then cauterize it on every knee with three cauterizers or four on every side, with this same cauterizer for the hip.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however many are needed for you by this cauterizer, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not insert your hand with the cauterizer, but rather to the thickness of the skin as much.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we have said from cauterization in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if the pains are only in the hands, then punctures around the focuses, as two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however there remains from pain in the fingers, then puncture them, a puncture above every knot and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak from a good regime, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regime is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God together with this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterizing for Hernias.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a hernia occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends or the navel to the testicle, and it is that which begins nearby: then it is necessary to prescribe for the weak to omit eating on their day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let them use lenients, so that feces may descend from their belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and prescribe to him, that he hold his breath, until it comes out, or the navel or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cauterizing iron under the hernia above the bone of the breast, with a mark whose extremities are similar to the middle of a circle at the top of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then ignite the cauterization iron, which is of this form, until it becomes white, and throws out sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or navel to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the servant put his hand over the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the thighs of the weak, and placed under it a pillow, and one servant over his thighs, and another over his breast who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then apply the cautery on that same sign, your hand with the cautery standing upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you achieve the mouth with it: or turn it with it twice, if you have not achieved it at first even to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and it comes out through that above into weakness or gangrene, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve the mouth with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is fitting that the cautery for infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointment, until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him be weak, lying on his back for forty days, until the wound is sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is fitting that you put its nourishment for the length of time of its cure, which will soothe its stomach: so that the intestine does not come out at the anus and vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him hold it for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be sparing of labor, and filling with food and drink, and violent voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus will he be healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure for hernias with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however hernias occur in the remaining belly, and are beginning, and it is seen that they do not increase, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let what is burned be one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it, with that which we have said: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first ones have said: that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is applied along the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line is applied to the lower part.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And put your hand in the middle with the cautery on the clavicle.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easiest and best.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of applying a cautery for pains caused by a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain members from a fall or a blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is of no benefit, then it is necessary to apply a cautery with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of each member be a second cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat over the same place with a cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For it is a custom of these pains that they change from one member to the one that is nearest to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Wherefore it is necessary to follow them with a cautery until the weak part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of applying a cautery for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	The leprous are sometimes helped by a very large cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that occurs due to the corruption of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you use a cautery to treat it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it does not decrease, nor does it stop: and you apply on top of the weak part that comprehends the corruption over the entire complexion of it: then apply a cautery to him on the head with five cauteries: one on the middle knot of the head, and a second below that towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally put your hand with the cautery briefly, until it impresses a small impression on the mouth, and the cortices will be dislocated from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors is eased from it, and cauterize with the cautery also over the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the weak part, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauterizations, which we mentioned in the head, and cauterize over the end of the nose, and with two cauterizations over the two jaws, and with two cauterizations over the vertebrae of the neck, and six over the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the bone near the base of the tail and one over it, in the same almeidati: and two over the hips: namely one over each hip, and two over the knees: one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the tendernesses of his chest: and cauterize it over every joint, of the joints of the fingers of his hands and his feet: and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves which are above the heel, that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the chest, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater is the help, and the more beneficial it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak person does not find pain in the cautery, as the healthy ones do: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizations be of a size, and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what has preceded regarding the types of irons.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat with a cauterization made from the powder of the herb with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Head of the Liver
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any member is in a stupor, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the stupified member with cauterizations, according to what the size of the member merits or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterization be shallow into the thickness of the skin for a little while.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when cauterization is applied for a stupor that occurs to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that member: and the stupor is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But truly let no one presume upon it, except he who is wise in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing for Barbers.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Barbers becomes chronic and nothing helps it from the resources of medicine: then cauterize on it with a deep cauterization for a little while, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the powder of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and hyrundin's blood: let one part be of each: mix all these things, and apply them to a cloth, and stick to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing for Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning and you want to restrain it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem to me, for I fear that it will become an ulcer, and I have already seen that happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it in a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in those who are bald.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has alopecia and it is slow to mature, either because of excessive flux causing it, or because of the weakness of old age, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of time and the need to hasten the maturation of alopecia, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing many times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten the maturation by itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you want to make a perforation of it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery, which is of this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the alopecia, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows, weak, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing for a corrosive evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but a corruption in a member that spreads, and it gnaws away the member itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then prepare many cauteries, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and none of it remains in any way.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then diminish it for three days, and apply over the cauterized location burnt sulphur with oil, until all eschars are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over that which remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The corroding is treated whenever with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself arises in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But indeed the cautery with fire is of swifter cure: and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in pimples and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens in the lower parts of the feet this disease: and it is a coarse, foul thing, which harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And the cautery indeed for them is in two ways: the cautery with fire, and the cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for that with fire, it is like a hollow cautery similar to a feather of a vulture: which is made from iron, according to the quantity that the nail contains on all sides: and let it be subtle in its margins.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then apply it ignited over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery penetrates to the depth of the nail: and diminish it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with woodland marshes, pounded with salt: and diminish the plaster over it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its own roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a generating ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	What if they are not turned and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then you will administer to them a cautery with hot water: and it is, that you take a small tube made of bronze, or iron, or of a bird's quill: and put it on the nail, or the outer skin.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a small quantity of hot water: hold your hand, and you turn it with compression of your hand for a short time, so that the margin of the tube is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the weak one wait for a while on the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then dispatch it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they have been eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing for Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When Tremors occur to someone from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between all the vertebrae a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and above his stomach a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For Tremors are quieted with an oily cautery, and hasten the health of cold ague.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing for the Albahtir (possibly a disease or condition).
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When foul Albahtir are expelled from the body, that is, pimples, which are made from corrupted thick materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore in the beginning when they appear, that the pustules on the entire head be cauterized with a subtle cauterization of myrtle wood, whose extremities have been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with a small point, at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method: and it does not increase: and the surplus is disrupted making them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nevertheless it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut near a wound, which happens externally, or at the time of an incision of an aposteme, or of a cauterization of a limb, and similar things to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to anyone, then quickly with your hand to the mouth of the artery, and put on it your index finger: and press it strongly, until the blood is blocked under your finger, and does not go out from it at all.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on the fire small olive cauterizers, and a large number of them: and blow upon them, until they are strongly ignited.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a small one, or a large one, according to the wound and the place, in which the artery is disrupted, and put the cauterizer on the vein itself, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cauterizer, until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	Which if it is expelled when the finger is lifted from the mouth of the artery, and the cauterizer is extinguished, then take another cauterizer quickly, from the cauterizers which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	You must not stop doing that one thing after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you confuse the nerve that is there, and the injury falls upon a weaker part.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or let it be tied with a strong thread of ligation.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of the proper nature be applied to it, which are to cut off blood, and let it be tied with a dressing of suitable constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who administers the cutting off of it with a ligature, and a dressing with a bandage, or an application of burning things, and similar, does not benefit him thoroughly, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to anyone, and there is not a doctor present to him, nor medicine: then let him begin with the application of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and a strong constriction of it, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed from upon it, but rather with cold water of vehement coldness always, until the blood congeals, and coagulates, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile let him consider what it needs from a cautery, or from medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Of Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have stated in the first chapter, all inflammation in which it is suitable to use with fire a cauterization and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and forms of cauterizations.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter with the same method: so that the searched-for thing is alleviated regarding the thing being searched for.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is from the fear of what is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary that caution be more vehement, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, by which life stands at the aperture of a vein, or incision over an aposteme, or aperture of an exit, or cure of an ulcer, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling, and fear, and death often occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, that there not befall you that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes men of a certain kind fall to men of a certain kind with modes of infirmities.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and death is light to him: on account of the vehemence of what he finds from his infirmity and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And the illness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his physician, and says to you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary that you agree to him who comes to you of this kind.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vehement than your greed and rapaciousness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not assume anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which proves to you that which leads to praiseworthy success.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And that you use judgment in the cure of all your weaknesses, and the prediction and indication of that to which health is most conveniently suited.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it is your aid for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His intellect, and may He not withhold from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck down to the feet: so that may be alleviated for you what you want from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the cure of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife pulls the head of the child with excessive force.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also happens sometimes from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have indeed not seen this sickness in others than in children: and for every one of them whom I saw, death came quickly: therefore it seemed to me that it was wise to desist from the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have indeed seen one of them, a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head was increasing in size every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture kept increasing, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the periosteum.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on it, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the humidity is greatly increased and the aposteme is greater, then put two fissures in accordance with this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the skull open on all sides, and water is pressed out when you compress it with your hand to the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make three fissures in the middle of the skull, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the fissures with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then undo the ligature, and cure the wound with dressings and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head with evenness.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak person all dry food of little humidity, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you consider where the greatness of the aposteme appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or on one side, or to the right, or to the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Go up therefore with the incision where it appears to you that the aposteme and collection of water are, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware lest you cut the artery, and there occurs a flow of blood, and the weak person dies from that flow with an evacuation of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter Two.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occur to someone catarrhs to the eyes, or to the chest, and that is aged, and the cure of medicines does not help: then the greatest cure is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when one wishes to make an incision on them, that the weak head should be shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a coarse cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak one constrict his neck, with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are places which are behind the ears depressed: and is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a branding iron above both: and let an incision be made on both sides with a sharp instrument, the incision extending to the mouth: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce the instrument under the artery, and make an incision upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the inside with a frequent leap.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the quantity of the space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a branding iron, and extend to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to emit from the blood, is six ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the virtue of the weak one and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains at the mouth from the flow, then cut it, so that hot aposteme does not occur: then constrict the ulcer with ligatures made from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old headache occurs to a man, or sharp catarrh because of acidic moistures and heat in the temples, or an old abscess, and similar things: and it is treated with modes of curative medicine, and it does not work: then we are experienced in these diseases in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them, is that the weak [operator] should shave the hairs which are on the temples, and direct it to the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself shows you from its own pulse, and is rarely hidden except in few men, or by the forgetfulness of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the weak one should bind his head with any bandage of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or fumigate the place with warm water, until it appears to you with a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scratch the skin with it with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw into it a hook, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and make it protrude from the tunics that are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is slender, then envelop it with the extremity of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the quantity by which its extremities stretch and contract, and there does not occur a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend inwardly.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let out from the blood a sixth of an ounce, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk: or of Alhohod cord, so that putrefaction does not come to it before consolidation of the wound, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the redundancy which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you use it, cauterize it with a cauterizing iron to the mouth, with a razor-shaped cauterizer, until its extremities are cut and it stands in the place of the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauterizer is one of those things which help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton, and powders properly made should be placed on it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the healing, it should be treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if meanwhile while you are operating there occurs a flow of blood from the artery, then hasten to cut it with a cauterizer, or to fill the place with cotton, and constrict your hand until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	What if none of those things are at hand, then place your finger over the spot until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the spot with water of vehement cold, until the acute pain subsides, and is constricted according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier than the extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize a vein with this cauterizer having two razor-like edges, and let the sharpness be similar to the file of a double-edged instrument.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are much less sharp than two razor-like edges.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two razor-like edges, the flesh hastens to become cold, and they do not cut with swiftness.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is some thickness in them, heat of fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: when this work is done it is better than any work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between two cauteries be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with cauterization: and apply both heated irons until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities will be pulled out.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not consolidated with this cauterization thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of a flow of tears that flows constantly from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant tears and there is a flow of them from the veins that are on the outside above the skull of the head: and no treatment with medicine or medicines helps them, and you see the face of the weak already reddened, and he feels in his forehead a crawling, as is the crawling of ants: and his eyes are strained, moist, so that already the lashes have been eaten away by corrosion: and his eyelids have been heated up from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients discovered this operation for their treatment, and they called it treatment with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should instruct the weak person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three equally distant fissures in the forehead according to its length: and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second following the length a little from the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are in both sides: and stretch out your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a sharp spatula between the two extremities, whose next mole is in the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temporal side, up to the second incision: and excise with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp cultellum, sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And put its sharp side towards the flesh joined with the skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood has flowed out equal, press out the places from clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put in all the fissures a dressing from old cloth, and put over them poultices soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot aposteme does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligament, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and other things which are used to treat wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of sharp tears and discharges from the eyes from the interiors of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp and bitter catarrhs occur to someone, and you see their eyes weakened, pale, and already their sight is debilitated: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and in the depth of the head there is sharp pain, aching, and consequent sneezing: then take from these accidents, that those matters and catarrhs do not come, except from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment in them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should order the weak to scratch their own forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in it a single fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another one across the width, and start with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and stretch out your hand from the muscles of the temples, which move during mastication: until when the bone is laid bare: and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cloth of old fabric, or with a linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind from above with small balls: and soak the small balls with wine and oil, so that no hot aposteme occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot aposteme has already diminished: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with an excitative regimen that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare from them a plaster, and administer to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, such as iron and vitriol: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a fluxible thing, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear from those that do not adhere nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drip into the ear something of violet oil, or of sisamum.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make sneeze with clysters, and stop the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you put in the circle of the ears pieces of cloth, or wool, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with Gestum, that is, finely ground Pizigarolis: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with gestum, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a finely ground hook of a small double quantity.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear deeply, and block what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no passage except for the tube: then extract with your forced blowing attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often comes out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not come out in this manner: then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of uisco, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and put it at the end of the style after you have wrapped around it a cloth decently positioned: then insert it into the opening of the ear with ease, after you have cleaned the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to cut, before there occurs a warm aposteme, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of cutting is, like a phlebotomy of the weak in the beginning in the head: and let out from it blood according to the measure of its virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn its ear upwards, and find a small cut in the root of the ear at its fat in the depressed place itself: and let the cut be of a lunar figure, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then heal the fissure from your hour with speed and cure it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What if a thing falls into the ear is one of the grains which grow and become inflamed then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out for you at the exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that species of grains which fall into the ear and do not do that when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear until you put many a poultice: then extract them with forceps or with a subtle instrument or with suction as we have said for its extraction will be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary that he use a weak snorting with condiments at first: and now his ear has been filled with some old cotyle: and it lies on that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, gentle, and warm them with fire for a little while, and let him put one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him step on one of them with his foot from that side, and strike with another stone above the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	He should not therefore cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out thus, that you take from a pomegranate or from a juniper one, and put one end of it into the ear: and burn the other end with fire until most of it is consumed.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another juniper and do that many times until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what was previously said regarding the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and its like, treat it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its affair is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If, therefore, anything appears there of worms, then extract it with forceps, or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose shape is this, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity that the weak part tolerates: then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not obey you to come out, then stop up the ends of the cannula with wax, as I have said concerning the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the affliction of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be what you pour in oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver, or of copper, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be so that the thing which is in the concavity of the cannula, is made from copper, turned on a lathe.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you use it, take a rod, and anoint the extremity of it with cotton of a suitable anointing: then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the rod with the cotton on top, and express it by your hand with tempered compression, until the oil is poured into the concavity of the hearing, and the weak part feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear, let it be previously warmed with fire for a little while: and beware lest there be something that is distilled in the cold valve: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an injury to the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has already happened to some men that an obstruction occurred in the passage of the ear from a wound or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this obstruction is sometimes made in the deep hole of the ear, which sight does not reach: and sometimes it happens at the outer part of the hole, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	The one, therefore, that happens in the deep ear, and which sight does not comprehend, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in the one that sight reaches, it is necessary to put the ear of the infirm person in the sun, and look at it: then if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with a spatulum subtle, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity be where there is some little width, whose part is acute: and let the rest of the spatulum be smooth on both sides: so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the obstruction is flesh born in the ear's passage, then hold it with a subtle hook, and cut it with a vehement facility, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	What if the obstruction is in the deep ear: then take a subtle and smooth rod, and heat it with fire for a little while: then put it into the ear's passage.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel the obstruction with this, that the infirm person meets with heaviness of hearing, try to open it with facility: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a plug according to the quantity of the width of the hole, which you wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for some days, until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take a piece of linen cloth, and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle powdered sugar over it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the abscess has already formed a postule, then it is necessary to extract the linen cloth, and let it out with another cloth, which you will have wrapped in cotton soaked in rose oil, until the hot aposteme subsides: then cure it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	And if a flow of blood happens: then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and put them on the ear: and use the remaining treatment that stops the flow of blood as described in the chapter on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the treatment for ulcers of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the ulcers that occur on the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to pull them with forceps, or with a hook, and to cut them with scissors from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then put powdered sugar on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lancet.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Of the treatment for pimples of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens on the eyelids something that resembles a nut in its hardness and density, and because of this it is called a pimple: and it is a collection of thick humidity on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation for them is therefore to consider then if it is a pimple that proceeds from what appears on the eyelid and moves to every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find then an incision above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scratch it on every side with ease, until it is hollowed out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however the cutting away of it is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will harm the weak one in something.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	What if the incision is large: then bring it together with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no evil will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For an ointment restores it and fleshes it over.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if a gland is inclined towards the interior of the ear turned to the inner surface, then turn the eyelid, and hang the gland with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	What if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it does not harm it in anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the gland with salt water: and treat the place with that which fleshes it over, until the weak one is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a tumor that forms in the upper eyelids: and it most often happens to children: and it weighs on their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears rush to them, and on account of this you see them rub their faces constantly, and they sleep with them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which an inflammation has already covered: and a visible bulge of Axirnath appears to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the weak person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare on it ligatures, and make from that ligature a circle according to the quantity that the Achilles contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it above it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Achilles gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with a spatula making an incision through the width, and let the incision not be greater than what is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you make a cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Achilles, for in many dispositions the Achilles proceeds from an incision according to the form of a fragment of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it therefore with the cloth that you had placed between your fingers on the outside, and you move your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed, and beware lest you add to the incision, so that you do not penetrate with the spatula to the eye and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the Achilles does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you add a little to the incision with ease, until the Achilles proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the place, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who apply salt, and put it in the cavity of the incision, so that it dissolves what remains of that humidity.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with cooling plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of relaxing the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes softened, whence it happens that it protrudes as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids of the eye besides the normal course of hairs, and become long: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a white spot, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the cataract of the eye is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Either by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or cataract is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with a needle, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you put the head of the afflicted person on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is thus turned back, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle into it, where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the needle.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with the spatula inserting from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and put under the eyelid a small cotton pad from a cloth or a pouch: then mark above the eyelid with cauterization, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Truly it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because it is already diversified in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are some who require that a large quantity be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines that you marked, and start from the larger tear to the smaller tear, and let there be one incision near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape out the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together with a suture the two lips, with a needle and thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what overflows from the threads above the two eyebrows, with certain things that cause scar formation, if you want to do that: and if not, do not trouble.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three days, or four: afterwards attend to it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the time of the wound's inflammation and its aggregation: but the future will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treating, the ancient ones taught Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	But truly in it is solicitude for the weak, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method exists also in Ataxmir: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined ones, according to this shape which follows, then cut away what is excess with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not equal that: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear, and a second thread near the smaller tear: and bring together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand to an equal elevation and elevate the cut above which the scar is marked, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and cure it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If a tumor or an aposteme occurs at your incision or your fissure: but apply that aposteme with a plaster, and similar things, from sitting ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens to the eyelids also, so that their hairs are converted.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said in the incision: but the suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you convert the eyelid, and split the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two rods, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already made an incision at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together both with subtlety above that which overflows from the eyelid of the eye, and bind two rods from both parts with a strong bandage, and leave it there for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin will be constricted and will become black and will rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not protrude.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of the two rods, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of protruding hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter Twelve.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is that you take a sharp needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, thin.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you gather its ends and tie each knot with a subtle knot, and the length of the threads is one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you put on the Alinxotati another subtle thread under that briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the weak person puts his head in your lap, and it should be near the sun as the operation is declared: since it is a subtle operation, or a minute one.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then you insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you extract from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then you pull the hair up to the thread of the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then you pull your hand with it, until the hair goes out with the Alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the Alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not go out with it: you pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you put in it, until the Alinxotati goes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then you pull the Alinxotati, and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh is born over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	What if the hair is short, then either associate to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it with that: or leave it until it grows after a space, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Of the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this condition occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina or Alxatrati disease of the eye.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati disease is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental one occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or from a cut, or from a cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is that you find the consolidation and separate its lips and put between them a linen pad and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not suitable to use in the treatment of it things that dry and constrict, for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was; instead use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek: and apply with water, in which cooked althea, flaxseed, and an ointment dyaquilon, which is melted with some oil: and anoint with it a linen pad, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate, according to the shape it had initially.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation that we mentioned is not other than a kind of correction of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati that occurs below is the one that is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a tear, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation for it is that you take a needle, in which there is double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a spatula on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is proper, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a needle, and put it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is formed: until when they are gathered this figure is formed, and it is the letter lauda in Greek.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh to the amount, which is the sharp lower side of it, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sew them with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have spoken of, concerning softening medicines and plasters, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if there is a falling away of the eyelid from the fissure, and the suture, or the cauterization: then it is necessary that you find a flat fissure under the hair of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a plaster, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the speech concerning the treatment of the eyelid, when it is above or below, is that it runs on this operation, according to what is prepared from the form of the eyelid.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is of many diversities in form: and the skilled artisan prepares his device with whatever mode is possible for him, so that he makes it return to the natural figure, or near to it, and the infirmity itself, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prohibits it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you should insert the extremity of the needle under the eyelid and elevate it upwards; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp in its incision, but rather dull for a short time: so that the weak eye is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is moved and hurts the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you excise the adhesion with facility, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour then into the eye salty water, with water wash it: or distill into it from a sieve made of dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread of flax: and put over the eye a woolen cloth soaked in the white of the egg: and after the third day use a sieve, and with poultices, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the nail and elevation of the flesh of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerve-like: and is similar to a thin, subtle splinter.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the humidity of frozen white matter: which when it touches iron, or a hook is used to seize it with a hook, it is cut off, and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin except from the greater tear duct, whence it proceeds gradually, until it covers the use of it, and prohibits the light and motion of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is: that the weak person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with the pincers of a pair of forceps, and extend it to the upper parts.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a thread from the hairs of a horse, and cow, or goat: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a short while, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it to the upper parts: and scratch the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were to sew it with the thread up to its posterior.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula, or with small forceps: and remove the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that there does not occur from the cutting a constant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with pincers alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scratch with a blunt spatula, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the corneal layer, and there occur a rupture in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the cutting, throw into the eye some ground salt, or a compound made from zinc, and let it remain there until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	For if the nail is not nerveless, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a pincer be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the section.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	For if you intend to cut it, then open the eye of the weak person, and take a subtle, thin, delicate spatula, with a sharp edge, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scratch the nail from above with subtle scraping.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	What if you see that it itself becomes rarefied and crushed, and the scraping is imprinted on it, then distill from your hour, into the eye, either a decoction made from lily or from red lead, or from triticated salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye to the contrary: then cease that, and cure the abscess, until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with scraping, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The flesh of the tear duct, if it harms the eye with great annoyance, should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away: and do not make the last cut, so that the flow of tears does not happen.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour into the tear duct either red lead or made from verdigris, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is born in certain eyes of men a red flesh, composed or overlaid, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is similar to the rose called balas ruby.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for this also is, that the weak one places his head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for that: and hold it with one forceps or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until the whole of it is ended with cutting.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not harm it during operation: and let your cutting be with which you cut it, or with a spatula, which we have described in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the asphodel is collected, according to what will appear after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the incision is complete and the entire white cataract is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt or pour into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines, and put on top of the eye a plaster made from the whites of eggs to secure it from the hot aposteme.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	What if there remains something of the cataract and hot blood dominates you, and a hot aposteme is coming on: then leave the eye, and cure it with what settles the aposteme.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it the treatment until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do similarly with the flesh that grows in the eye from this condition.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	Truly it is necessary that you should omit the cure of every weak eye from natural or accidental damage, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Of the collection of pus in the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus are red veins that gather over the eye and prevent the sight from performing its function, and weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore for you first to consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and does not have any illness in it except for the pus: then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should order the weak person to put their head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook or two according to your judgment and let the hook be subtle and double-edged, according to this shape, or let there be two hooks graduated on one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with subtle forceps with subtlety and wipe away the blood hour after hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved and beware lest you harm the eye with the extremities of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and you should be strong in your operation indeed: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have cleansed, then distill into the eye either a green or red substance: so that its sharpness wears away what remains of the cataract.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until its pain has subsided: and it is secure from a hot abscess: then repeat over it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the nasal fracture.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call it Arissat's fistula, which you will treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its description has previously stated.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no ingenuity in it: except that you find a collection of pus at the birth of it, and extract all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see in it a rottenness or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the head of the scraper.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like a grindstone, which should be punctuated with the punctuation of a file, or the punctuation of a fine awl: and put it on the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then rub it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a little while, until you know that the corruption has already been scraped: and do that several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines that are astringent and caustic.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the flow of blood is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and is not burst, and no accident happens to it: then you should know that it is already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no ingenuity in it, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this method.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape the bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is scraped, then take an instrument according to this method, let it be a metal extremity, triangular: and its wood be a pyramid extended to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch out your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the instrument, until it penetrates the bone, and the weak one feels it: by which he finds the breath coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Then restore the place with medicines that dry and tighten, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then flesh is born, and the place becomes hardened: then the matter that was flowing to the outside, returns to the nose: therefore it is easier on the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the Eye protrudes with its entirety, and there is no damage to the sight, nor diminishment: then it is necessary that you release the weak one: then you phlebotomize him: afterwards you put cups on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the Eye an ointment that is made from gum acacia, and aloe, and galbanum, and myrrh.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie a bandage over the eye with many poultices on top.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of poultices is that you take many soft cloths and double each cloth four times: make many of them: then put them one on top of another, a second according to the quantity which the eye needs: then tie over them with a hard cloth tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the applications with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the applications, and bind the eye tightly by day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage is again softened, then it is necessary that it be tied tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already returned to its own coat, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and poultices, and bandage, and applications, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a disruption occurs in the conjunctiva, then it protrudes and comes out from between the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and the shape of the man is disfigured because of that, and there is need to cut it: then the operation on it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you insert a needle in the root of the conjunctiva from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread on the tear side, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle according to its own position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the conjunctiva around the needle: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then pull out the needle, and put over the eye a woolen cloth on the white of the eye: and leave it, until the thread falls away with the conjunctiva.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the wound is constricted on every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be perforated with a subtle spatula, which penetrates to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows out, and the eye sinks down, and immediately enters: then constrict it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of cataract.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati, is nothing but a humor, that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is, that you make the weak patient sit on a prepared seat, or a directed one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of it with your hands on both sides, and move it, until you see the cataract pass to the lower parts of the eye.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed, and does not come down, and the light is freed: and the weak person sees things as he used to see: and if it does not come down below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of the cataract is not prepared with what we have said, then make the weak person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula, and press with it above the corneal membrane a little at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the cataract comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then distill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have spoken of the types of waters in their division, and those that are suitable for perforation, as the discourse declares and sets forth, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary that you make the weak one sit between your hands square, opposite to the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and hold it strongly: then touch the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the cataract needle, if the eye is the left one: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the point of the needle near the corona through the thickness of the radius on the white of the eye apparent at the lesser lacrimal corner: then push the needle with strength: and you withdraw your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the length of the journey of the needle to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the same pupil of the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it below little by little one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends at once, then the weak one sees that which is above what has opened his vision at once, and the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then put it back a second time, except that the needle should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When I elevate the arm, and it does not rise: then extract the arrowhead with ease: and you will free your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt of gem in water: and wash the inflamed eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye a whole pledget or a cloth soaked in rose oil and white of egg: and tie it to the sound eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We however, and those who are of our time, put on top a mixture of ground cumin with white of egg.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if the arrowhead does not pass into the eye for you on account of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then you should take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Perform with it the conjunction only so much, and do not put your hand in the opening: and it is not except to make a way to the arrowhead subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the arrowhead, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the weak person a bed decently made, in which they sleep on their back in a dark house: and prohibit them from all movements, and from coughing: and put their food that which soothes their nature: and do not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the dressing be according to its condition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then undo it in that dark house, and test his vision: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then return to the dressing until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary to do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: but rather it is necessary to avoid it: because water rises quickly through violent looking.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a hot aposteme occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh: and straighten it with what sits on the aposteme, until it sits: then without its use, and put over its face an oral bandage which regulates its use under it for some days, it being in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should go out of the house gradually, and stay in his own houses.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the disciple is not to be blamed for looking at the zältea several times: for then he will dare above the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, through which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	For I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the magda, so that he who is ignorant of them will stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from their own copper: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular, and the extremities pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Of the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there are born in the nose diverse fleshes that are added, among which is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is a cancerous flesh, of stone, of dark color: and from it is what is a smooth flesh, not of dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that therefore which is from these fleshes and is smooth, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the weak one sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open its nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes: then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have comprehended of them with a subtle sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the whole flesh has already been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	What if there remains anything of it whose removal is not possible then rub that with one of the subtle instruments with ease until there does not remain anything of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however the blood dominates you, or there occurs a hot abscess, then apply to it what is suitable, or it is one of the malignant abscesses, then cauterize him quickly, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let vinegar and water or wine be thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose appears and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however the moisture does not penetrate according to what is suitable, then know that there is flesh born inside it in the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness and knots on it many knots and put between each knot the quantity of a finger or less and let the weak one ingeniously so that he puts one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he made something similar to azar and pull his mucus until it reaches the lowest part and comes out above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many boys indeed do something similar to this in schools of Atto, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take a minister to saw the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is already caught with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a dressing that you have dipped in Egyptian ointment, do that for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the thing a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment which dries, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head purging device, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver or copper: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a head purging device should be full, detected: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat in it oil, or whatever you want from juices and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a polyp grows at the end of the nose and increases and grows with time until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary to cauterize it at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the place either a cautery or a medicine that burns which takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the cutting of it is delayed until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, of little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous apostema.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that he who cuts a cancerous apostema and because of it a great evil happens to the one who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is of a soft touch, not dark in color, and you see that cutting all of it is possible, then evacuate the weak part, and cut it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the place with what dries and constricts until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	We should know when there occurs a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation is not very reliable, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything of that sort happens to someone, that you consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then bring the lips of the wound together with a suture, and afterwards treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the separation are already separated, and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary that you excavate every part from its own skin until it becomes bloody.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tie them, and powder over the blood with dragon's blood and ground frankincense, and put above the powders a piece of plaster of diafion, and one of the other consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads come apart by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the suture is that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suture of the belly, or bring together the separation with a thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of knots of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men have occurrences of hard scabs on the insides of their lips similar to grains of a herb, and some are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and find above every knot of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut into it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with zegi trot, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then let it be glued with vinegar, and the place be cured with it, in which there is a contraction, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Of the incision of the flesh born above the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Flesh often grows above the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore that you suspend it with a hook: or that you hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the blood or serum flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put over the place zegi trot, or other powders that are astringent and excitant.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	For if that flesh returns after the cure, for it often returns, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Of the scraping of the teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes there gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums rough, foul, and sometimes blackened cortices, and they become yellow, and green, until corruption comes from that to the gum, and the teeth are made foul by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the weak person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, in which you see cortices, and things similar to sand: until nothing remains of them, and do similarly with the blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and other things until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping over them a second time, and a third, until the utmost effort reaches what you are using.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth requires razors of diverse forms, many figures, according to which your operation is prepared: namely, because the razor with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the razor with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors should be prepared by you, which you will use.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that its place is supplied when it is extracted: because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for extracting it, then it is necessary when the tooth is weakened to extract it, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you as a painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the weak tooth, and it seems that it is in the adjacent tooth, and extracts it: then the pain does not cease, until the weak tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting physicians.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps at first little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in it with a good grip, and hold the head of the weak one between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it is not moved: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and introduce it under the tooth on all sides with ease, and constrain its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the dense is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a piece of cloth and tie it with a slender extremity of a radius, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act skillfully with scarification around the gum on all sides abundantly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and it returns upon the weak part from that evil which is greater than its pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and boldness over the eradication of it, beyond what we have administered.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great weaknesses to come upon men, which are difficult to break, and all the roots of it remain, or some of them: or so that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be cleansed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood happens from the places (for it often happens), then take something of gum and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the gum does not adhere to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shape of the slender forceps which moves the dense thing at first, should be of long extremities, with a short handle, thick, so that they do not double when pressed upon the tooth: they should be as you see of thick handles, until when you press with them, they do not bite themselves, nor double: of short extremities, and let them be made from iron or made decently from refined steel, with straight extremities: and in their extremities let there be teeth, which some enter into others, and press with a decent constriction, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when there are extremities such as the form of the mouth of a bird which is called a cicatrice, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains upon the eradication of a tooth which breaks something, then it is necessary that you put on the spot a plaster with butter for one day or two days, until the spot softens: then introduce to it cotton threads or forceps: whose extremities are similar to the mouth of a bird which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of this is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like the file of teeth: or like a toothpick.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to you for exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you cut above the root, and you remove all the flesh, and you introduce an instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be of short extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be imbued, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root goes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of triangular extremity subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is also helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and iron tools which were mentioned previously in the scraping of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be imbued.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and the skilled artisan, subtle in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according to which he signifies the operation and the diseases themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If the bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or becomes putrid: then probe above it in its place with that which is suitable for it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gesture, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it something of thickness gradually, so that it may be tightened, or the bone may be held with it, and it does not flee and is stable, until the bone emerges: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is little putridness in the bone, then scrape the bone itself from its putridness, and cure it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the sawing of prominent teeth above the others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not protrude according to their natural course, a foul form is made by it: and especially when this happens in women, and girls, namely those who are vain.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and does not fit in its place, or it is possible to file or smooth it: then extract it: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, of sharp extremity, strongly.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be that which you cut with for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another of the teeth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If it is prominent and exposed to its own lime, then the lime itself with lime from indigo, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be all from indigo, and its handle with few points of valda, just as the lime with which needles are made: with which it is smoothed gradually over many days with ease, so that the dens is not disturbed and falls away: then smooth the lime itself in the end, and rub it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	What if it is a dens, from which a part breaks and injures the tongue: then it is necessary to smooth it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even: and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the gold wire retention of teeth.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there happens to the anterior teeth a concussion and commotion from a blow or fall: and the weak one cannot grasp onto what he eats so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment was of no use: then the ingenious plan for them is to bind with a gold wire: because silver becomes greenish, and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of moderate thickness and coarseness according to the quantity which it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the retention is, that you take the wire and insert double of it between two healthy teeth: then weave with both ends of the wire between the movable teeth, whether one or several, until you come with the web to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving until the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not moved further: and let your constriction by which you tighten the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not protrude.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous filaments of the thread with the forceps, and take up both, and turn them with the tongs, and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it be tightened thus while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	And if it becomes loosened, or is cut, tie them with another thread, and it will stay thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the retention of two sound teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens that one tooth or two return to their places after a fall, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and this is not done except by an artisan who is prudent and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is adapted from the bones of the cheeks: and it is made into the form of a tooth, and put in the place, from which the tooth is strengthened and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the infirm person in your lap, and elevate their tongue: then cut that nervous ligament in width, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	What if in it there is something hard and knotted, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then introduce an instrument into that, and probe it in width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let it be dressed in the wound with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a plaster of flax, which will hold the weakness for all night, so that it is not consolidated by the second.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If there should be a flow of blood, then put on the place powdered zeolite.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood truly conquers you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery, which is suitable for that: then cure it with the remainder of the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the Ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	It sometimes happens under the tongue an apostema which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural operation: and perhaps it grows so much, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the weak person before the sun: and examine the apostema.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it to be of a dark color, or black, and hard, which the weak person does not feel: then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it leans to whiteness, in which there is humidity, then throw on it a poultice, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	What if the blood conquers you during your operation, then put on it powdered zeolite, until the blood is stanched: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be dressed with vinegar and salt: and cure it with the remainder of the cure suitable for that, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of the apostema of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	It sometimes happens in the throat a swelling, that is, glands, which are similar to almond-like swellings, which occur in the jaw: and they are named the two Amygdalae: which when you cure with what we have said in the division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard aposteme, of a dark colour, and of little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red colour, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either bore through it: or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white colour, round, and its root is subtle: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if the aposteme has completed its heat quietly, or is diminished by some diminution: then make the weak sit in front of the sun, and its head be in your bosom: and open its mouth, and let the servant receive between his hands, and press its tongue below with an instrument, of this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver, or copper, which is subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press its tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the gum, and pull it outwards as much as you can, except that you draw with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, of this form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is assimilated to the forceps: nevertheless its extremities are curved, so that the orifice of each one is directly opposite the acute end: hence take care that it be of iron unbroken, or steel steeped.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not at hand, then cut it with a spatulum, of this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one gum, cut the other according to the same species of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then afterwards the weak person should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if a flow of blood happens to him, he should gargle with water in which the barks of pomegranates have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood is cut off: then treat it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when other abscesses form in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut them therefore according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed have already treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat, which was pulling towards the throat, with little sensation, which had almost closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prohibited her from eating, and drinking water: and she had already come close to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they went out above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I approached quickly and fixed a hook in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it and a large portion was pulled out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it was grasping from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what had come out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess: then I cut off from it a part of it, and there did not come out from it except a little blood: therefore the throat of the woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took nourishment.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not therefore cease to cut into that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess would fill in the place of what I was cutting, until it was prolonged too much and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I cauterized the ingrown and the aposteme between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood firm after the application: then I walked away from that place, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the incision of the aposteme of the eyelid.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the cold descends to the eyelid and it becomes inflamed and is long: then it itself is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it itself is called a pustule.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work: and you see that the hot aposteme has quieted from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary to incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which from it is gathered round, and is not length to it, and is bloody, or of a dark color, or black, and there is no feeling to it: then it is necessary to avoid the incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it is fear concerning the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you see it according to the method which I said from its whiteness and length, that you make the weak one sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument, whose description was previously mentioned: then fix a hook in the eyelid, and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two glands.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not incise from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use that which we described in the incision of the two glands: and treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the weak one trembles at the incision: then it is necessary that you use cunning in the cauterization of it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the manner of cauterization in it is not, unless with sharp water; and it is, as you put the head of the weak one in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and prepare with it a lime not extinguished, and put it not thick, nor subtle, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremities of it in which the medicine is placed be concave, like the concavity of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And put the instrument with medicine on the wound itself: and let the weak one be lying on his side, so that saliva runs out of his mouth from the inner medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat, and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it to the wound for the first time in the quantity of a half hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine is settled.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a piece of cloth, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour the cloth with medicine, and insert the radius with the cloth into the canal above, until the cloth adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it alone: for it will fall off by itself and drop off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you judge that you should repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization cleanse the area around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and clean it with what is in the area of the wound from the medicine: and wash with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is a more wholesome species of cure by incision and longer from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the ulcers are cured also with that which is more subtle than cauterization and incision: for they are cured with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamentum, and hyssop, and origan, and rue, and ssach, and chamomile, and abrotan, and similar things from herbs: and gather all those things, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be luted with clay decently: and there should be an opening in the middle of the pot, over which is composed a concave instrument according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver or brass: and the extremity, in which is a grain, should be inserted into the mouth of the infirm, until the vapour ascends to the ulcer above the tube, until the ulcer is much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then iterate over it many times, until it is scraped away.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, that you do not make this cure at the beginning of the approaching abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For a poultice adds to the abscess: and it is not proper to make that unless at the decline of the abscess when it becomes cold.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a cane, and compose on the extremity of it a cortex of egg: so that the mouth of the infirm does not burn: for the cortex of egg prohibits vapour from burning the mouth: and this is from good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Of the extraction of thorns and bones from the jaw.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times it happens that a bone, or a fish spine, or something else sticks in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract that which of them appears obvious on which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the seat, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the weak vomit before it is digested by food in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the weak person should swallow a piece of nap, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a small dry crumb of bread: or take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it on a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the place where there are vertebrae, or bones, and is pulled out, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument made of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a rod for a little while, and at its end let there be a curvature, which enters into the throat with ease: and let it have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it beware of touching its own epiglottis, so that coughing does not happen to it, and let it push the mouth, or bone, or the doctor himself insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the weak person inserts, this is better: on account of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and he pushes downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of bloodsuckers.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodsucker is treated with what I have said in the division on curation with medicines, and it does not come out, then examine the throat of the weak person before the sun, or at the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that I have described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your sight then falls upon the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook, or with dexterous fingers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	What if it is not possible with them: then take a curved tube, and insert it into the throat of the weak person up to the throat; afterwards insert into the curvature of the tube ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times: and let the weak person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full pitcher of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything of it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a leech sticks to it when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the weak person with bugs, or with rue with an instrument that I described in the fumigation of the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it itself will fall out.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are hot coals with fire: and let the pot be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole: and let the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw in the fumigation, and let the weak person put his mouth on the extremity of the tube, and let him close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it comes out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls on the same uvula.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremities are similar to the mouth of a bird, which is called a cicoria, in which there is roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their cutting, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many species of abscesses, of many modes, according to which the treatment of them comes, namely one and one in this book: and they are diverse in the perforation of them, and the cutting of them from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the species of abscess by itself, and that which it comprehends from humours.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of the places, in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the abscesses there are some which ought not to be perforated, unless after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion: and of them there are, which ought to be perforated, while they are raw, and do not mature according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its existence is prolonged, until it putrefies what is in the area around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint become corrupted: which is a cause more proximate to the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay the perforation of it, until it matures, it will harm either it or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	It is next to the anus, perforate it if it is immature: and it is not suitable to perforate a crude aposteme, not fully digested, unless it is next to the anus, so that it does not putrefy the depth, and reaches into the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes in its termination what will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the aposteme, which has matured according to its completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the aposteme: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the perforation in the lowest place of the aposteme, and of the most prominent elevation: and let the perforation be going in the length of the body, if the apostemes are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the shoulders, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and at last in all equal places, to which there is not a reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those however that reflect, let it go with the perforation according to that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the aposteme is in fleshy places: then it is better that you omit its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps the lips of it will become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemes are perforated according to the width of the body by necessity: or according to that which the membrane needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer to small apostemes a small perforation, and to large apostemes a large perforation: or many sections by the similarity of the size of the aposteme.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are of the apostemes, in which it is necessary that the skin be concave: and incised when already made like a cloth, and made at the termination, which already is dead: as that which happens to many, as to the dubre, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of them are those which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of them is one, from which an incision is made like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like a groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of them are those in which is administered a round incision, and a lunar incision: and similar to them from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one indeed which has no head, as are lenial superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced by a superficial perforation, or merely a plane.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is thick, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you not press and extract all the pus at that hour: but rather extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then dress the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the degree, until it comes out: especially if he is weak of strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the animal spirit is often dissolved with the exit of pus: and perhaps the weak person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and take care.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then administer dressings made from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings of the incision, it is necessary then that you insert a dressing into every opening, until they reach the bottom.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when cloth is woven, or wool is shorn from flax without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply it, and treat it with what is suitable from the ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	And if a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which the cloth is soaked in it: and you put it on the place of the flow of blood many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer a treatment, and cure, and powders, which I have described in many places in this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	And if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and you put them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you put powders soaked in water, and oil, or wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess, and wipe it clean, and administer in its cure what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of abscesses in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Following the path of division, I have already spoken of every abscess, in what way it is a route to its cure, chapter by chapter, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Of the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There occur on the skin of the head small abscesses, and they are of the species of Knots, which are contained in sacs, which are attached to them: as if they themselves were the eggs of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty: and some of them contain a humidity similar to slime: and some of them contain a humidity similar to decayed flesh and pus: and similar things, and some of them are hard stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that at the time of their cutting it does not cause a contradictory condition of the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the cutting of them is, that you should try it with an instrument, whose form will be described later, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it by a cut in the length of the superficial cut: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And let the cutting begin from line b to line g, when the moisture is evacuated, then scratch out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it returns many times, if anything of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the stump in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it eats away what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the stump with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you apply it to it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains, then treat the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	What if the apostema contains a fatty knot: then cut it according to this form, having the shape of a cross: and apply poultices between the lips of the incision, and excise it from every side: and show your skill in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery makes a contrary condition for you, then do that which I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do similarly in the case of a stone, from cutting and cure of the same, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting over a stone apostema is easier: since there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain apostemata which are on the head in certain men, with which there is no humidity inside.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: that I cut into an apostema on the head of an old woman, and I found the apostema like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were to strike it by throwing something, it would wound it.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other accidental apostemata on the head, besides these, namely the apostemata that occur on the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of blood may be alleviated to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat it with what is suitable for it from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Of the cutting of strphulons on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apostemata often occur on the neck and under the armpits and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which occur on the neck, there are one or many: and they generate from among themselves: and every Strophula of them is within its own proper tunic, as it is with knots and apostemata of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Strophulons.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And some of them are stony: and some of them contain humidity: and some of them are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one then which of them you see of good disposition to the touch, whose manifest proximity is to the color of the skin, and it moves in every part, and it is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the gullet, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: it should be that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, and along the line, and excavate it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we have said in the apostemata of the head, and extract it little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, that the vein or nerve is not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula be not sharp, lest you add your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak part, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut the vein, or artery, it prohibits you from operation, then put on the wound zegi powder, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the aposteme quiets, and the wound softens: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is staunched by a tunic of bandage, return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your index finger, if anything remains of the small scales: therefore cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if it is in the root of the Strophula a large vein: then it is necessary that you do not cut that Strophula from its root: moreover it is necessary that you tie it with a double strong thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already steeped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole Strophula is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew them themselves immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that excess remains because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary that you proceed to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture that we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the Strophulas contains humidity, make a superficial hole in it: so that the place of its maturation appears to you: and put the hole from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer a dressing with ointment after the perforation, and similar things to it, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound is already clean: then treat it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Of the cutting of the epiglottis from an abscess that happens inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this cutting on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those who have a strangled or constricted condition, it is necessary that the cutting of the epiglottis be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or two tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the cutting of the epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which comes from the suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore when we want that, to cut the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, a small cutting in width, in what is between two circles in quantity, so that it is a cutting in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for cutting, since it is deprived of flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	For if the doctor is fearful, then it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then let him pierce the skin, until when he reaches the canal: let him avoid the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the sifac which we have described: and it is indicated above the cutting of the canal from the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is disrupted, and from the separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour arrives in which the prostration is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and suture it by itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Said Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition, except when they see that one of these apostems has already strangled the throat of the infirm, and the infirm has been lifted up from death, and his breath has been intercepted: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the infirm may breathe over the place of the wound by some breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open, until the malignity of the disease is consumed, and its malignity is three days, or nearly; then therefore they have ordered to suture the wound, and to cure it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen with my own eyes is, that a servant girl took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to the cure of it, and I found her dying, as is the dying of one who is about to die.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I probed the wound, and I found blood that had come out from the wound a little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was confident therefore that she had not cut the vein, nor the windpipe: and air came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated the wound therefore, and I cured it, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl, except hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days to her better disposition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the surgical incision of the throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This condition called hernia of the throat is a large abscess, second to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two modes: for it is either natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one certainly there is no swelling.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, is in two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that forms from a knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that an incision be made into it with iron, unless it is small: and you will test it, and investigate it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it, as knots are cut: and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then thoroughly search all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is proper for the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the surgical incision of the kinds of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already spoken about all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a Knot and an Exitura: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when there is an Exitura, there is heat, and fever, and violent pains, until it is calmed by the boiling of the excess, and completed by putrefaction: then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a Knot, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in cysts of the spleen, which is their proper sac, and it is second to the color of the body: and its shape is like a chickpea, and it forms like a bag, and is greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are divided into two types: either fatty or containing humidity.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you approach the cure of a Knot, that you examine it, and investigate it first with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to which its form will appear in the chapter which is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiring about abscesses and all Knots is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess: and you move your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then you put your hand last according to the measure of the magnitude of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the Intromissum, and consider what goes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a flowing humidity comes out, whatever the color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said about the remaining abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if humidity does not come out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: dry therefore above it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and rub away the skin from every side with ease: and keep a plaster if you can over it, so that you extract it healthy with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the plaster breaks apart during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it healthy, for this often happens, then extract it by force, until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or a lot of it remains, the Knot returns according to the majority.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you and a little of it remains: then fill the wound at the completion of your task with certain corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and put on top of it what sits on the abscess, a warm application, and cure it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then it is a large Knot, then sew its two lips, and cure it with that which brings flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then you have a contrary vein, pulsating or not pulsating: then press, and fill the place of the zegi with a plaster, and keep it tight for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of blood subsides: then return to cut that which remains of the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Of the forms of instruments for cutting and boring.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These are the forms of the Introductors, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For there is one large, and one medium, and one small among them.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron of a quadrangular shape with well-finished extremities, so that they hold the entrance in the scabet.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the Experimenta, which is to say, the perforators: and one of them is called a Beris, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For there is one large, and one medium, and one small among them.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are adapted to investigate through them the abscesses, and the exit wounds, and the fistulas, and the buboes from that which is between them of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like large needles with which they sew the sutures, namely of citrus, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those that are made from citrus.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And the Experimenta are also made from black lead, which are adapted to probe through them the fistulas, of which the concavities are reflections, so that they reflect with their bluntness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For there are some of them which are long, some which are medium, and some which are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The forms of ulcers, and there are many species of them.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For some of these are simple, namely those which have one treatment, and they are of three species, as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And of them there are hidden ulcers, and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And of them there are ulcers having two treatments, and they are of three species: and of them there are ulcers having three treatments, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of surgical scrapers, with which they cut and excise knots and apostemes: and they are of three species: for some of them are great, middle, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which a section is made are acute, the other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus, except so that with them there is made a juncture in the excision of knots in fear of cutting the vein or nerve: and so that the weak one may be healed by it, and find tranquility for a time from the burning which it found at the excision of an aposteme.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are scalpels, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and are similar to a razor, with which is made a scrape: and on the flat extremity there is a hidden point of the spatula: and it scrapes towards the interior, and towards the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers for the perforation of apostemes: and the weak ones do not perceive them: and they are of three species, great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the cauteries with which the flow of blood is stopped: and they are of three species, great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass or bronze, round, of a moderate length, as you see: and let them be subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these species of Ventsarum are with you, both large and small, so that you can cut blood quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body, and you should not use them except in fleshy places: such as the arms, thighs, and hips, and arms, breasts, belly, groin, and similar fleshy and moist ones.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments are made from them similar to the blades of lancets, according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the cutting of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of breasts in men that resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflamed with an accumulation of fluid when they begin to sleep, until they resemble women's breasts, and remain as foul abscesses.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who abhors this, it is necessary that he cut above the breasts in a lunar section, according to this shape from line b to line g, then scratch out all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the breast however declines to the lower parts and becomes soft because of its size, as it happens with women: then it is necessary that two sections similar to the lunar figure be found on its upper sides, each of which is connected to the other at their ends, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Afterwards scratch out the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not close the incision of what you need to cut, because of the discomfort of the weak or because of the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a submersed corrosive ointment, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of a postilence, which happens under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These postilences that happen under the nipple, are of the kinds of hard Strophulatum, which contain cysts, and of them are those which contain humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which therefore are of those which contain humors, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b. to line g., when therefore the whole thing that is in the postilence is evacuated of blood, then fill it with old oil, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the plaster be removed, and cured with an ointment suitable to it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	What if the postilence was of the kind of nodes of Strophulatum, then cut above it, as we have said in the section on Strophuluses equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends to this that it emits pus, then administer to it a cautery, according to what we have said in what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the cutting of a postilence which happens because of an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is disrupted and the skin which is above it is consolidated, then very often a postilence happens from it: and similarly it happens to veins also, so that a postilence and inflammation happen.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that a postilence and inflammation are because of an artery and a vein, are: since when a postilence is because of an artery, it is long, gathered in the depth of the body: and when you press on the postilence with your fingers, you feel as if there were a hissing.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is on account of the Vein, is round in the visible body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the cutting above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great fault.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that the care of it should be withdrawn from iron, and what of them is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it should be withdrawn.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On that therefore which of them is from the inflation of the opening of the artery, make an incision in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with forceps, afterwards the artery: and free it from its coats, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert under it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to that which I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a cure that generates pus, until the ligaments fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable to it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	What if the abscess is on account of a section of the vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be in it double thread, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to that which I said to you in the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you wish to extract the thread, then insert another needle with a different thread under the entire suture at the site of the incision of the wound: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the suture in the middle of itself, until when what is in it comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and release what has been tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of it a poultice which you have steeped in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with wraps and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Of the suture that happens from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L (or 50)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as a suture happens in an artery and a vein, similarly a suture happens in nerves: which happens to them from a blow, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it happens most often in the places of the joints, or heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious suture.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is tied with a bandage, it feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a suture gathered in the depth of the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and it does not proceed to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What therefore is in the joints, does not need to be treated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps indeed a contraction happens.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is on the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small suture, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it with a hook, and scratch it: then remove it, and gather the wound with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of an abscess that happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	It happens to certain men many times in their bellies and in the rest of their bodies, these things that are called Fungal infections, on account of their similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Of which the root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is one of them that is small: and there is one of them that is greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have indeed already seen a man, and in his belly there were two fungal growths, which were more similar to mushrooms than the others: there was no difference between them, they were white, with small roots, and their lips were inverted, and they oozed, and moisture flowed out of them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut them out, and I found that one of them weighed about 9 ounces and the other about 6 ounces. And the operation for cutting them out is, that you should consider then, if the patient is weak and the color of the fungal growth is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut it out with a broad spatula, and let cauterizing irons be at hand in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during the cutting of it: therefore if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see that the patient is weak, fearful and timid of the cutting with iron, then take a thread made from lead, and tie it around the tumor: whose method is what we have said, and leave it on for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then apply to the constriction a lead plaster.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not then cease to tie on the lead, as many times as you press on the fungal growth, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the fungal growth is thick-rooted, then there is something to fear and be anxious about in its cutting: especially if it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not cut into the blackened part which is of a dark color, of little sensation, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous aposteme: and I call it with recollection of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of the navel's swelling.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The swelling of the navel occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a tear of the diaphragm, which is above the belly: and there comes out from it either gut or intestine, according to what happens in the remainder of the rupture.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from flatulence constricted in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is on account of a tear of the diaphragm, and the exit of the gut: then it is a color of an apostema similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in different situations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is on account of the protrusion of the intestine, then its situation is with that which we have described, of more vehement diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a noise with it: and it is greatly increased at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is on account of moisture, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	For if it is on account of blood, then with these signs an apostema appears like a blackness from the tumor.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is on account of flesh that has grown: then it is a grave, thick, hard apostema, and it is shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If the swelling is due to obesity, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the Artery, or Vein, or obesity: then it is necessary that you prohibit the cure of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and terror in it, as I have taught you in the chapter, in which I said that apostema is due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	Which if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or the hernia: then it is necessary that you order the weak person, so that he may hold his breath, and stand standing upright.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with a cauterizing agent around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards order him, that he should be raised up between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then go around with a wide spatula in the area of the navel above the place that you marked with cauterizing agent.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the apostema upwards, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around the strong part with a thread, or with a string of firm silk binding: and let the knot of the binding be secure.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the apostema that is extended above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you have found it already caught by the binding: then extract the secured one, and insert into it your index finger, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you have found a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If on the other hand the artery or vein is opposite to you: then go around it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles around the area that you made around the apostema in the shape of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the thread around the abscess in four places above the needle, and if it is necessary, remove the needle, and leave the place until the rotten flesh falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes subtle and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is suitable from ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if there is a protrusion of the navel from the flesh, either from it or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the division of the species of cancer, and how it is the way to cure it with medicines: and what is to be avoided in its cure with iron, so that it does not become an ulcer: and we have spoken about cancer generated in the matrix, and the caution in its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar members located for extraction of all of it, especially when it is beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it becomes old and is large, it is not necessary to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself was not able to heal anyone from it, nor have I seen another before me who has approached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede and solve the weak part with black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then perform bloodletting on it if you find it with a clear fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part for preparation, in which it will be treated with an operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw onto the cancer ointments that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	After that, press it from all sides with the skin, according to the inspection, until nothing of its roots remains: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but rather express the place, and wipe away all the gross blood with your hand, or with any instrument that is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of gross blood causes a contrary condition for you from the incision of an artery or a vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We will now describe in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron, is not except the single species of ascites: and it does not approach with iron the species of tympanites: nor the species of hypozarca inwardly: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not been effective: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already befallen the patient, or if there is another infirmity with it besides Dropsy: such as if there is with it a cough, or a loosening of the stomach, and similar things: then beware lest you treat him with iron: for that is to be feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see the weak person of overflowing strength, and there is no sickness with it besides Dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is, that you should lift up the weak person standing between your hands, and the servant behind him presses his stomach with his hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiney spongy  bone, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It has two sharp parts, is long, and the extremity is pointed like a spine.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But let there be in it something of shortness little by little, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation to the intestine, and harm it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of dropsy from the intestines, then it is necessary that you should lengthen the incision by the quantity of three fingers from the navel downwards directly above the breast.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of dropsy is because of disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision be on the side above which the weak person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin entirely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spiney instrument between the skin, and scrape, as if you were exfoliating it: and let the quantity which is scraped be the quantity of a nail, or around that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape and pierce until the spiney instrument reaches the empty place: and it is the place of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold, polished: which has in its lower part a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side: and its edge is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: on its upper end is a handle.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument penetrates the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, so it evacuates from the water half of its quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, then the weak person will perhaps die immediately by resolution of its animal spirit, or a syncope will befall him which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the weak person signify to you from the virtue of his pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is, that it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the orifice that is above the fistula: about which I have told you, so that you should perforate it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see the weak person tolerate it: and also evacuate a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there does not remain from the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the weak person, and you leave a large amount from the water: then treat it with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and wait upon thirst: and treat it with evacuating medicines, until it is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the evacuation of the water: according to what I have told you in that which precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary places not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 45.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant goes out from the womb of its mother, and the head of its bladder is not perforated, or the orifice is constricted, or is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to help with the perforation of it immediately when it is born with a very fine spatula, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the hole a subtle key made of lead, and tie it: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the bladder is raised to emit urine, let it be removed, and micturated.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead, then it is possible that the urine which falls on the place will not permit it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He, however, whose hole is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those, however, in whom the hole is not in its proper place, are wounded.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because among those who are born with it, the hole is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate to the front, unless he lifts the penis with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is not for him generation, because the sperm cannot pass to the womb according to nature: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment for that is, that the weak one should be placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut the head of the head of the penis from the place of the priap, with a needle or a sharp spatula: just as is the cutting of a reed, or just as you scrape something, so that the middle of it comes to be like the head of the penis: and so that the hole falls in the middle according to what is proper.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware for yourself during the operation of a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it has happened many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Apply to him therefore that which stops the blood, and cure the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of Albucasis, concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 6
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albather often occur on a branch, and it is an eminence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of them are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on it a plaster soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with dyafinicon ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	Which if the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should administer to it a cautery after the incision of it and its rasping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the Albather is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the Albather is under the foreskin, and part of it is outside: then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until when it has consolidated, then treat the outer one: for when you treat them both at the same time, the foreskin does not heal unless it becomes perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also occur on the testicles, and a blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	You should therefore burn away all that has already become blackened, and what you want to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on it afterwards a mixture made with honey that has been mixed with the flour of toasted coriander seeds and crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If a flow of blood occurs, then administer a cautery with lunar cautery, in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is useful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood and for an ulcer when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	Which if the head of the branch is corroded and destroyed entirely in one hour: then you should insert into the wound of the penis a pipe made of lead, so that urine flows out through it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adherence of the skin of the foreskin to the head of the virga, and this adherence does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require circumcision; and when adherence occurs due to a wound or an abscess, it is necessary to cauterize it with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the virga is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	What is difficult to discern by feeling, then it is necessary to cauterize something from the head of the virga and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is, that the foreskin, when it is subtle, is perhaps perforated on account of its subtlety quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the virga with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and the cure of errors that happen to them by chance.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: nevertheless since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in children, it is necessary that we indicate in this operation the better method, and the easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not make use of it in their laws, and it is not except what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	What is, that I have found the greater part of artisans and phlebotomists to use purification by circumcision with a razor, and with forceps; and they use cauterization, and a ligature with a thread, and an incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tried all these methods, and I did not find a better purification than with forceps and a ligature with a thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, it often slips from the skin.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains: it is forced to a cutting to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing that is done by rubbing, that is, digitally, which barbers use, the cutting of the extremity of the member of the viril does not secure: since perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with the nail, perhaps the iron slips and corrupts your operation: and the skin of a child is brief by nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Cleansing with forceps and ligature with thread has shown me a good experiment: since the forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness that is above is as the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and there is made a compression of similar figure, containing the skin of the member from every part, with which there does not occur error altogether.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of the operation itself is, that you cause to extract, especially a child, if it is one of those who understands for a little while, what you do not do, except that you tie the thread on its member as much: and you leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, from the fact that he receives his own understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared for the stature, and let him not be sitting: and hide the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into its branch, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the branch emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the filth that has accumulated in the squalor.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie below it for a short space a second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and thumb, the place of the lower ligature with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the branch.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of an egg has been spread, mixed with fresh rose oil: and let it stay on until the next day: and treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the lancet for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be dull, and let them be cutting: so that a branch of the nail does not protrude from them: and let the length of the two edges be equal to the length of two finger joints.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error that occurs in cleansing is this: because perhaps the whole inner skin slips away, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out with your finger before the cicatrization of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	What if you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however three days have passed and the swelling that is under the branch remains, then let it be until the hot aposteme has settled, and remove it with ease, and cut it according to what has been prepared for you: and beware of the head of the branch.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treatment is therefore with that which consolidates the wound from powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it cuts into the skin above the measure, and goes to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treatment is therefore with that which we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by blockage made from a stone, or coagulated blood, or pus, or ingrown flesh, and similar things to them which we have spoken of in the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is on account of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he should be made to lean forward over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and let him tightly hold his breath as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is pressed therefore with the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the back: wherefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	What if it is not solved with that which we have said, and the thing is severe on the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be subtle, thin, hollow like the quill of a feather in subtlety of a radius, long in likeness to one and a half palms: to which let there be a thin tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie at its end a thread or a cotton, with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with forceps if something overflows from the thread, truly insert into the tube with vehemence, like an almond.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the siringa with oil, or with butter, and the white of the egg: and make the weak sit on a seat, and embrocate the vesicle, and its own virga with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the virga with ease, until it reaches to the root of the virga.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it over itself at the part above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa into it, until it reaches to the bladder, and the weak person feels that it has already reached to the empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless the passage, through which it goes, is where there is a curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with a woolen string little by little.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the catheter will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make the catheter run through the urine passage: and repeat the siringa, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the weak person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of cleansing the bladder with a Clyster.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there happens to be an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and one wants to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with the instrument that is called a Clyster, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is, stopped up.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, it attracts from the humidity: and when it is pushed, it expels afar: according to what makes the clyster, with which naphtha is thrown, that is, Greek fire on the hearth of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When I insert the instrument to project humidity into the bladder, I introduce the extremity of the catheter into the humidity, and pull with it that which pushes upwards, for humidity is pulled into the concavity of the catheter.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then I introduce its extremity into the vein, according to that which we have narrated in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then I push humidity with that which pushes it, for humidity immediately penetrates to the bladder, so that the weak person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a thin enema instrument by which the bladder is enemad.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver or gold: whose head is higher like a small spoon, and below it a notch in which the thread falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a goat, and put in it humidity, with which you will enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two notches with a strong ligature with double thread: and warm that humidity a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the enema instrument into the vein, afterwards press your hand over the bladder with humidity with a suitable pressure, until the weak person feels that the humidity has already penetrated to the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and pierce it throughout all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the rose is gathered: after which you put in it that which you use from humectants, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it on the instrument: and do with it as you have done with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the humidity penetrates to the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken about the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medications, and I have said the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have said the Stone in which the operation falls by hand and cutting: and it is a Stone generated in the bladder properly: and that one which is fixed on the staff: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the Stone generated in the bladder, happens most to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of its signs is that urine goes out from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his staff, and labors with it, and many times it hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises, and goes out with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing is easy for children, as long as they are up to fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is moderate, in that which is between the two: and of whom the Stone is larger, the treatment is easier: and if small, the care is the opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the weak one with a clyster, which will extract all the dung that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the weak one be taken by his feet and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the Stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or jumps from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder inclines downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and feel him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately with the proper section over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	What if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil, if he is a weak boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and feel for the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and push it to the outside against the place where you want the section: and instruct one assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to stretch the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand to remove the skin which is under the testicles on the part away from the place in which is the section.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spatula blade, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the section be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that it be exteriorly ample, and interiorly strict, according to the quantity that it is possible for the egress of the stone from it not being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the section, and it goes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that because of the stone there are angles and edges, for which its exit is made difficult on account of them.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, similar to a acorn, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore for those which have angles and edges, add an incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not go out thus, then it is necessary that you grope over it: or bind over it with a device decently, whose extremity is like the crescent moon, which binds over the stone and does not depart from it: or that you insert under it an instrument subtle, of curved extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot see on top of it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if anything of blood comes out from it, cut it off with a ligature.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone in the bladder, then first push the largest to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push a small one after that, and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if the stone is very large, then it is ignorance to try to cut out the large one itself.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or that there occurs to him a continuous dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Administer its expulsion, until it comes out: or use instruments in the fracture with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with resin, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot aposteme may be assuaged.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then let the weak person rest with his neck elevated, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you then loosen it, bathe the place with water, and a lot of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment called diaphenicum, and the ointment basilicum, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot aposteme should occur in the wound, with added corrosion, and similar things: such as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and it is recognized by the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply all the species with that which is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the hours of treatment of the whole, that you bind two hips, and gather, the medicinal causes which are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	What if the stone is small, and it is in the flesh of the rod, and it is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prohibited: then treat it with what I will narrate before you proceed to the cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will be exempt from the cutting through this treatment, for I have already proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And there is, that you take a perforator made of iron, whose form this is, triangular pointedness, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie it with that rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforator into the rod with ease, until it reaches the perforator to the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone little by little: and complete the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For urine will be freed at once.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the external part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself breaks, and comes out with urine, and the weak man is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment does not prepare itself for you, on account of something that prohibits it from that: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the same rod between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards loosen the ligament, and clean the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the vein; and another tie above, except that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for that reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to elevate the skin upwards, so that it returns to your complement, and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of a stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it happens to any of them that a stone forms, then the treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to the physician, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, that you do not find a woman who knows well this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the remoteness of the place of the stone: wherefore it requires a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	What if necessity calls for it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, knowing well: and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you truly keep them private, then seek a modest physician, subtle, and present a female midwife well taught in the matter of women, or a woman who has acquired a part of the art: make her present, and especially instruct her, that she do all that you prescribe to her from the examination concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	At first what is, to examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then he finds it, he constricts it under his finger, and then orders the midwife to insert her finger into the weak opening, and feels above the stone, after which she places her left hand on the bladder, and squeezes it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gradually moves it from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest strength of his, until he reaches it at the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts above it at the opposite of the middle of the opening at the root of the hip, from whichever side is prepared for him, and he feels the stone on that side: and his finger does not move away from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts the branch above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then he feels the stone, then he adds to the incision a second cut proportional in quantity to that which the stone protrudes from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among them is the small and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long and the round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its species, that it may be indicated to you by this above what you are going to do.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then the blood overcomes you, then add to the place of the injury a pound of flour, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stanched.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and do, that you prepare with yourself the instruments which I have spoken of in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may assist by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	For if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and constrict it with a strict bandage: and do not touch it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For a weak woman will probably die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore a gathering of blood sits after some days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone goes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Of the cutting of the watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery collection is not a hernia, unless it is an aggregation of humidity in the white membrane, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is named a membrane.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it purifies: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, which we have spoken of: and that is not made except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this watery collection, is from a weakness which happens to the testicles: for which reason this material flows forth to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For it is either of a yellowish color, or it is red with blood, or filthy, black, or it is watery white, and that is what is most.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white membrane which we have spoken of, then the tumor is round in length for a while as the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, since the humidity contains it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is humidity in its own proper membrane, then the tumor is round with part of an egg, and on account of this a man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under feeling.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When I apply my knowledge of the colour of humidity, then I examine the colour of humidity in an abscess with a square probe, whose shape precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Next to that which I observe as it exits the track of what has been inserted, I judge from that which is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we proceed to a cure with iron, then it is necessary to prescribe to the weak, that they be bled if possible for them, and you see their body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be placed on his back on a high place slightly elevated, and many cloths should be put under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, who should extend his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along the length, until almost to the pectine: and let the incision be according to the rectitude of the equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white skin that surrounds: and clear away the same and observe, or beware lest you cut from this, as you cut the same: and your clearing should be where it is suspended with the egg more: and carefully examine with the clearing according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then puncture the full skin with water with a wide puncture, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with forceps, and extend the skin to the top, and do not touch the skin that surrounds the testicles: and cut the skin as it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety or in a piece, especially the thin part.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine, in the incision of it there is no security, lest water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however the egg emerges outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then when you complete the incision of the womb, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then cure it as the remaining wounds, until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	What if you find the egg corrupted from blackness of another, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensors, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensor, and extract the egg: afterwards cure it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is collected in the two parts, then know that there are two branches: cut therefore one part equally as you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions a thread steeped in oil, or in rose oil: and put on top of it another thread which you have steeped in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the navel: and put above double cloths, and they are poultices: and tie them above with a bandage, which is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken, and they should suck, and the threads which have been steeped should fill them, according to this likeness: and let extremities be made which are pressed from a cot, or a wet thread: and let them be bound with a bandage on the loins of the arms: and one extremity should reach to the thigh up to the back, and the second should reach to the part of the chest: and two extremities over the two hips below, and two other extremities over the two groins, and all the bandage should be bound in the loins of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this hernia is artificially treated with a cautery at the place of the incision with iron: and it is, that you take a sharp knife-cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have described: until when it is detected, a white tissue containing water: then take the cautery, according to this method.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then perforate with it that tissue, and it is ignited, until all the moisture goes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the tissue with forceps, and scratch with a sharp ignited cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you eradicate the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and less prone to a flow of blood, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If however it shows opposition to you at the time of incision, or at the time of cautery, a hot aposteme, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what shows opposition to you from that with a cure which is suitable for it, according to what has been said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is weak and fearful, and does not expect more than this operation, on account of his horror: then administer the perforation according to what I describe it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is confirmed to you by what we have said concerning the signs, that the hernia is watery: then it is necessary that you make the weak person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the aposteme in its lower part with a broad spatula: and make the puncture according to the length of the body, and let it be open wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put on the place a dressing, and bind it, and let it be so that the remainder of the water runs out: then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is a contrariety to the egress of water at the time when you perforate it: and it is not except on account of this, because the white pad makes a contrariety in the orifice of the wound, and prohibits the exit of the water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water of dropsy is extracted, whose form has preceded: or add for a short while in the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that the water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it accumulates, then it will perforate according to the same method, and the weak days will pass.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of a fleshy tumor.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the incision above this tumor, there is a fear of inducing a deadly peril in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Wherefore it seems to me that its abandonment is more beneficial for the health from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall an operation on it, and the appearance of a postulate.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore, that many gatherings occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and this is caused by many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an excess of sharp or sour humors, which flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the gathering is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious gathering.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like gathering, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from a knotting of the arteries, and their inflation: as has already been mentioned earlier: or from an inflammation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which therefore is from them by an inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the condition of the gathering, when you press on it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not suitable that you touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is made from the inflammation of veins, does not disappear because of compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section is made on this species, and on the remaining flesh: and it is, as one cuts the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the eyelid upwards, and extract it with a white sifauch: and free the suspensory membrane from the vessel, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory membrane after you have freed it from every part of the eyelid.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the eyelid is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you attract the eyelid, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adherence of something from the siphac, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free the entire adherence, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut all of it, and extract the eyelid, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine: afterwards treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of Rams, which is with Vites.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Uitis is an unturned aposteme, a certain unturning similar to a bunch, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise difficult on the weakened area, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this sickness is fear, because of the memory of that which has come before.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is truly necessary that we speak of the operation according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary for the weak one to sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then strike the suspension of the testicles to the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the instruments that are closest to the rod: and let another servant hold it, and stretch it with a vehement stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a cross-section directly through the vessels, until they are laid bare.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scratch from every part, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards fix in them a needle in which is double thread, and tie it in the first of the places to which the vessels are attached: and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from foul corrupt humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you wish to generate a sanative, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If however the vessel happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles with the vessels be extracted for this: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, on account of the incision, and wither, or dry up, and is not a help with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the treatment of Intestinal wounds.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this wound is from a section, which happens in the sifac expanded over the belly in the groin area from the navel of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifac or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign is when it is from the extension of the ankle.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is what happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal aposteme towards the deep, therefore because the ankle compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign is when it is from a section of the ankle, because it makes happen from the beginning a vehement pain suddenly: and it is a diverse aposteme, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the ankle.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it goes out with the intestine a knob: and this is called Ramex intestinalis, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with bloating.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes dung runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and it is with that a weakness of the flanks: for it makes happen a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of the species of this disease with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be cautioned in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you instruct the weak person, to reduce the intestine with his hand to the interior of its own concavity, if it has fallen back.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be lifted up over his neck between your hands: and his legs should be elevated.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the skin of the testicles along its entire length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix on both lips of the incision hooks, according to which you indicate to open the incision with them: and let the incision be according to the quantity that is possible, so that the egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scratch the ankle and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white ankle is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger in what follows the testicle, in what is between the ankle and the white, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the ankle and the second, and release with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white membrane upwards, with your left hand: and lift the vein with the membrane to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant, to extend the vein upwards: and you loosen the adhesion, which is behind the completed solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, that there is not something from the intestine involved in the white hard membrane of the spleen.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find something of it: then push it to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made a ligature from ten threads: and introduce it at the back of the last membrane, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others with a figure that is in the shape of a cross: and tie with them the membrane, of which we spoke, which is under the skin of the testicles with a vehement ligature, until none of the vessels, which nourish them can send to them anything: so that there does not happen from it a hot apostema.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again a second ligature outside the first ligature, being less than two fingers in length from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures release from the membrane, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely around, and take away the vein.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then sew in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the incision, from which runs blood and serum: as we have described in what was previously said.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer a wool submerged in oil, and put it on the wound: and administer the ligature that we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white tonsil is cauterized, which we have mentioned, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its fall is delayed, then let it be soaked with warm water: and put on it what we have said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remainder of the treatment of wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On the Lance-shaped Instrument.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter sixty-six.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this lance I have not seen anyone who has dared to undertake its treatment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said, that it is done as we have described in the lance which is with a vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to bind the vessels after the incision over them with ease below: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the vessels fall: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the rupture that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter sixty-seven.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is very little, and returns every hour: but if the time with this condition is prolonged, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happens due to the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the sifach extends: then it becomes soft, and the place becomes inflamed, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as the description of it has preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this manner: and it is done so that the weak person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the rupture and the prominent part, a cross-section in width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then pull the Alsifak and those that are under the skin, until when it is stretched the white Sifach, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the rasp, and put it on the prominent place of the Sifach, and press it to the depth of the wound.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew two prominent places on the extremity of the rasp from the Sifach, and join one of them with the other with a suture: then extract the extremity of the rasp.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the Alsifak at all, nor stretch the groin, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal rupture.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it becomes consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the Sifach is contracted, and the prominence of the Rupture is not increased.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles often becomes softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them becomes softened, and their appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure it, to make the weak one lie on his back, and to cut all the skin that has been softened above the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if necessary, first close the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and tighten the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden by our law, and because of it I would be allowed not to mention it in my book, and its mention would not be necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it is a thing in the science of medicine when one is questioned about it, and so that he may know the cure for one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the second reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our use by it, such as donkeys, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by extraction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by extraction, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften and relax and hang, then we extract them with our hand until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensor, and cut above all one ovary with a single cut, until when two ovaries proceed: then incise those after you have excavated both, and do not leave on them anything from silk except subtle silk, which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by extraction: because extraction perhaps leaves something of the testicles, for which reason the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of the Hermaphrodite of two kinds.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite from urine is second in two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The defect of theirs is that which appears in the space that follows, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, a figure similar to a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs out from that which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women however there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubic area just like the testicles of a small man entirely, standing out to the exterior: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men and one species from women, is: that it is necessary to cut away the excess flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the cure of remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the cutting of the Tentiginis, and the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The prepuce perhaps is added over the natural part, until it becomes deformed and its appearance is foul: and sometimes it is magnified in certain women to such a degree, that it expands like in men, and reaches to the coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to hold the excess of the prepuce with the hand, or with a hook, and cut: and do not cease in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root: so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh that is born, is a flesh that grows in the opening of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it comes out to the exterior similar to a tail: and because of this some of the first call it a caudal affliction.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that we incise it as we incise the tenthigin, and we should treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of Alratica, which is a woman's ulcer that is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, that it is a woman's ulcer not perforated, or it is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from the sickness that precedes it: and this indeed occurs either from flesh born added, or from sifach subtle, or from spissus: and it happens either in the depth of the matrix, or in its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and prohibits coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prohibits menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its recognition is made by the appearance of the obstetrician, if the obstruction is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the obstruction is from subtle sifach and it is near the two lips: then touch and disrupt it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place a poultice on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your indexes of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her thighs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with force, until the subtle sifach is disrupted and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not consolidated with vice.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If the sifach is thick and spissus, then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the obstruction is from flesh born, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and let there be with you medicines which calm the flux of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus mixed with the whites of eggs.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a cannula made of lead, so that the wound does not heal quickly, it will hold for some days; and administer a bandage made from dry linen, then the rest will be cured by treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is a growth in the matrix of native flesh of other things, it is necessary therefore that they be cut according to this method: since there is not an apostema which is cancerous for an apostema is indeed cancerous which is in the matrix, let there not be done with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehel, and Bothor of rubies in the wounds of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed openings of the veins, until a lot of blood flows out from them continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become hard: and I have already spoken of the division of their types, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix and do not appear to the sense, then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those of them which are in the opening of the matrix, upon which the sense falls, are those which can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that the woman be put into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the hemorrhoids with the fingers, or with coarse cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle over them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without sharpness: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and incense, and similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and a broth of pomegranates, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over its back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is drawn with it, it is good: and if not, make the ventoses and the breasts adhere to the back without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the apostema rests, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth verily is a red color like the heads of alhassa, and is of rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said equally in the case: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There occur in the matrix many kinds of apostemas, such as cancer, and apostema of stone, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot apostema.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already spoken of all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of hot apostema which occurs in the matrix, when it is one of the apostemas which collect blood, and you should know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apostema at its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it being red: if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps against maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is suitable to make the woman sit on a seat which has two seats, and she should lean back or lie on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of the abdomen: and her hips should be expanded, and she should put her arms under her thighs, and tie them with a convenient ligature to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit at the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the matrix is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those things that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is suitable when you are about to administer this instrument, that you fix with the radius the depth of the woman's matrix: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than the depth, then it is suitable that you put pads on the surface of the depth of the matrix: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is suitable that a loop which runs on the instrument be placed from the upper side: and that it hold the instrument, and that the operator turn the loop, until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears and is touched by the hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it is suitable that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the sanies is evacuated, then it is suitable that you put on the wound a plaster submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and put the plaster, and extract the section from the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the matrix, and on the pubes a clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are washed, then a clyster is applied with water and honey; afterwards with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; afterwards it returns to an ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	What if the wound has been hidden within the matrix, then it is necessary that you forbid the cure of it with iron, but rather cure it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they medicate living embryos, according to a figure not natural, having come out.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the figure of a naturally born child.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs of it are, that when you see a woman pressed at the lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and is relieved by what is above her from the birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or suspended from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary that her womb be pressed, so that the embryo may come down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it comes down over its head, the afterbirth comes down with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities of a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, not to be praised.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands come out: or its belly comes out: and perhaps it turns back over its neck, and similar things from unnatural figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing the whole figure of them, and how the device is in it, and it is signified by that, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus moves up above its head with its natural movement, and presses upon the woman, and parturition becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and fumigate her vulva with decocted fenugreek, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert her fingers into the little spatule, and find the secundina with it, and cut it with her nail, until what is in it runs out from the humidity: and press the belly of the woman, until the fetus comes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	And if it does not come down, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with conditis, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if the two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	And if it does not pass into the birth passage, then put the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall with the striking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and pull it out gently: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The fetus coming out over its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out over its own feet, then it is necessary that you push them upwards: then turn the fetus little by little: afterwards pull it evenly.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and stretch it out little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they go out as far as the hips, then order him to compress it, and make him sneeze with the condiment: for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then reduce the fomentation little by little, until you put it in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	What if it is prohibited with all that we have described: then take from the mucus of the altea, and the oil of sisamine, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with a good pounding: then smear the vulva of the woman, and her lower belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until she obtains an enema.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a suppository of myrrh: and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the suppository for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and pinch its mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with an easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the feces will come out immediately.

Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this shape, then she will insert her hands gradually while introducing them.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will be lifted up over her neck, and her feet will hang down to the lower parts: and she herself will lie on a bed, and clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the dusty things, until it is prepared in the lower part.

Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is placed in the reduction of his hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it, then let him lift the woman, and have her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed she is not able to walk, then let him make her lie on a bed, and shake her thighs with violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment that you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	Which if it receives the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then attend to the reduction with the hands, and straighten the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus exits with its neck stretched out, hands extended, and its face towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the fetus's hand, then slowly turn it around, and straighten it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is straightened, then put on its neck what we have mentioned, made from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move gradually.

¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus exits on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until it comes out from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If I suspend it over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus to the inside, until you place it according to what is fitting: and instruct the woman to press herself several times: for it will come out by itself with a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are born many times: and when three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But truly that is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live thoroughly: and the afterbirth contains them, however many they are multiplied, one secundine: and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between them the ligature at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out just as one fetus comes out by the natural and easy way: and they come out with an unnatural exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	What if some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach that which we have spoken of from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have described: and let there be a subtle and skilled midwife, and she will do what she does with ease and slowness, and will guide according to every figure with what is prepared for her from guiding ingenuity for health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The memory of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me, that a woman aborting has expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore is all necessary that it should be in the science of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For it will perhaps reach to something similar to that: he should oppose to it with what is suitable
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76, Head or Chapter Seventy-six, Head
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division on medication, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sound strength and is not with any of the accidents on account of which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman breathe again on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined downward, and her thighs be elevated: and an assistant hold her from two sides, or she be tied to the bed, so that her body not be extruded during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then the mouth of the matrix should be moistened with humid oils, with mucus of altea, and fenugreek, and seed of flax.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucus: then she should introduce it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should search with it for the place where she will fix the hooks of the fetus, and the places convenient to that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its throat, or in places near the ribs, and under the false ribs.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however it has descended on its feet, then in its chest, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curvature in that which is between the fingers of the left hand: and introduce with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should put another hook in opposition to it, or a third, if necessary, so that the contraction is equal and does not incline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and the extension is not just according to straightness, but rather it moves to every part, so that its exit is alleviated, as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in what is between them, that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	What if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoints some fingers with oil and inserts them from the side, so that she turns it out with them, what was retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth is wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the whole thing comes out, cut it at the joint of the foot, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do the same with the other hand, and with the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or it meets with constriction at the exit, or there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary that a sharp Spatumile is inserted between the fingers, and searches with it the head, and extracts the water: or it breaks it with an instrument which is called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, do it if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary that you cut the shoulder blade: or extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then you pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head comes out and it is narrowed at the armpit then it will be found until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become compact and nor obstructs the exit: then cut the head bit by bit, according to that which is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the belly is an apostema, or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the matrix is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is narrowed at the belly or chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and find the belly or chest, until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the matrix is open, then she should insert her hand into the depth of the matrix, and seek with it the head, and draw it out with her fingers to the mouth of the matrix: then she should insert in it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	What if the mouth of the matrix is narrowed, on account of the hot apostema that has happened to it: then it is not necessary that she should labor over it, but rather it is necessary then to administer an effusion of humid things, of ointments: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	What if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it can be straightened: then administer what we have said regarding a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	What if it is not possible, then cut it bit by bit, and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is suitable that you should not leave anything from the second intestine inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding the hot apostemes that occur in the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	What if a flow of blood occurs, then let it be stopped with astringent waters, and administer the remainder of the cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have indeed already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was, then she became pregnant on top of it with another, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, a postulate occurred to her after a long time on her navel, and it became inflated, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called therefore to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed therefore on it some strong attractive plasters: and the bone went out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed therefore by this, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I probed the wound, and I extracted many bones, with the woman being in a better state of health: and she lived for a long time afterwards, and a little pus was discharged from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not confirmed this strange thing, except that there is science and assistance in it, for what the medical artisan administers with his hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Of the forms of necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 78.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	This figure below is the form of a stretcher, to which are equal two books, on which there are two equal joints at the ends of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	The treatment for this Vertigo requires that it should be finer than a strictorium: and that it is made either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood is about two fingers, and the thickness of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions made from the same type of wood, which have already been fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matricis, so that it opens with them when you turn the two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the Vertigo by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, according to the likeness of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, on the extremity of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you use it to open the matrix, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging, and what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two connected additions into the matrix: and you hold the extremity of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you need from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of another Vertigo which the ancients called the Shape of the Impeller by which the fetus is expelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the Almisdac, with which the large head is pressed: and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth on the extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And whenever a dressing is applied, such as forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdad with which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a staple having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a staple having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more their kinds are multiplied, and the more they are prepared by the artisan, the swifter he is to his operation, and the higher he is among men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise any of these instruments, so that it may be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their necessity is indeed inescusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the placenta.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the placenta is retained with the afterbirth, then it is necessary to advise the weak, so that it retains its own breathing.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it sneeze with condiments: and press your hand over its mouth, and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate in its cover a hole: and put in it heating herbs of the matrix, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sesam, and lignea cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bulb of reeds over the hole of the pot's cover, and another extremity into the mouth of the matrix: and hold it until the vapor penetrates to the concoction of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second one will go out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the Midwife to immerse her hand in oil of sesame, or mallow.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her insert it into the vulva, and seek with it the Second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and pull it out little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached in the depth of the womb, then let her insert her hand, according as we have described, until when she finds the Second one, and pulls it out little by little according to what is right, so that the womb does not fall with violent pulling: indeed it is necessary, that it be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then let there be added to the quantity of the pulling.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it will detach itself then, and be freed, and come away from the adherence.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	Which if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and from a medication of oil with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you fatigue yourself over it in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is necessary indeed, that what comes out from it to the mouth of the womb, you tie to the thigh of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint her with the ointment Tetrapharmakon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy it after some days, and dissolve it, and bring it out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Truly when it has putrefied, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms that weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that fumigations suitable for it be administered.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Certain of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and fig and sycamore.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of an instrument with which a woman is fumigated for retention of the secundina and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a bowl similar to an alcama or from clay: and let the broad extremity be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be put on the coals: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and let another be repeated.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Of the cure of an anus not perforated.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anus is not perforated, whom the subtle sifac has already closed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore, that the midwife should perforate that sifac with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatulum: and let her beware of the arm, lest it touch.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on it a wool cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however you fear that it will close, then put in the hole a small tube of lead for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wants to evacuate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now closure of the anus also occurs from consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be cut, then treated with what we said regarding the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Of the cure of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas that occur in the lower parts are a knotting and a thickening which occur near the anus or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knotting becomes old, it opens, and a watery white humidity or subtle pus runs out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when there are some of these fistulas that penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore penetrating fistulas are recognized by that which exits from the evacuation and flatulence, when the weak one uses the evacuation, and perhaps exits from the worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are of them fistulas when they penetrate in space up to the bladder and up to the passage of the rod.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are of them penetrating ones up to the joint of the hip, and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that by which is known the penetrating fistula up to the anus, also from the non-penetrating one, it is, that you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a subtle probe made of brass or iron into the fistula: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	Which if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a subtle probe made of lead, or a hair from the hairs of horses, until you feel the probe, or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	Which if you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the opening from evacuation, nor flatulence, nor worms as I said: then know that it is a non-penetrating one: proceed therefore to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or to the passage of urine: then its signification is the exit of urine from it, and prohibition of it by this, that the place be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is a penetrating one up to the joint of the hip or to the socket of the hip: then its sign is that the probe penetrates up to that place, if there is no tortuosity in it up to the mouth: and finding pain in the surrounding part, and that pus always exits from it: and that medication is not effective in it, nor is it consolidated with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish medicines, on which it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating and not chronic, healing may be expected with a plaster: according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven: and it is, so that the weak person lies on his back between your hands: and lift his legs up above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then a probe of lead or bronze is inserted, if there is a tortuousness in the fistula, until you know where it passes through.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If the weak person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel on your finger that the probe has already penetrated through by itself being detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the sifac, or flesh: then you certainly know that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor in it, since its healing is not, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that flesh is healed in certain men and from the medication by which healing is hoped for, it is to apply a subtle cauterium of ignition according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert the ignited thing into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those added and filtered-out fleshy growths, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with cloths wrapped in butter, until the burned-out flesh comes out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out and has not reached up to your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or sifac: and you see the fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you dissect with the probe that is in the fistula, until the dissection reaches where the end of the probe meets, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts that resemble a bird's crop or gizzard, so that nothing remains in them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if the blood overcomes you and separates between you and your operation so that it cuts off those flesh parts, then it is better to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire brings together good habits, an adjustment of those added flesh parts, and a cutting off of the blood, and a drying of the moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with dressings wrapped in butter or pounded cabbage stalks, until the spot emits pus and those flesh parts that were burned protrude in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh, and there are medicines in which there are astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and do not repeat the treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has already penetrated to the depth of the anus and is prolonged from the surplus of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a thin layer, and between you and it there is a covering of sifac or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then the operation is not in that, except by way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, that one of the three methods is administered in it: either you cauterize it, as we have said: or you cut it, until you achieve its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert dressings and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not injure the membrane that contains the anus, and it happens over the weak point of the passage of excretion without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	For the wound will be healed; either you will lengthen the bandage, and clean it after you cut it up to near the anus, as we have said, or with a probe, or with another instrument of a sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts which are in the cut, as far as you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then consider the restoration of the whole wound with the cut, and the upper orifice where it consolidates: and a remaining fistula stays open in the interior part of the anus, and will be lighter on the weaker.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when a fistula follows in this manner: and it is, when you insert the probe into the Fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take the probe of perforated extremity, which is like a needle alekef, that is, preparing hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and tie around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is penetrating the edge of the anus inside near, then pull out the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together the two ends: and tie both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until the fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread cut and fall: then treat the wound, until it consolidates, and is healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the orifice of the Fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate by whatever method is prepared for you, unless it is deep within.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you should not do that on account of the liver, so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spoon for a patient with a fistula, whose curvature is sharp and one part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from the cutting of them: and the cure of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two kinds of hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, like vessels full of blood, or they are like a grain of a nut.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	But truly those that are outside the anus, for the most part have little humidity, from which flows watery or yellowish fluid, or a small amount of blood with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus, is that you should apply to the weak one so that it may sit: and it is squeezed, until the anus comes out, and the threads appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hang them with hooks: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held by the hooks, because of their humidity and softening: then take them with a coarse cloth, or with a thread from two twisted wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder over them after the cutting certain hot powders, so that they may take the place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously described in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remainder of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	What if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give a weak enema of such a composition that there is a little mordicatio to cause it to loosen what is in the anus and to obey evacuation quickly when the weak one evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their treatment is easy and simple: and it is that you seize them with your finger or seize them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And he who is averse to cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an unwound thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull out the hemorrhoid upwards and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and tie the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, and let them be crosswise: and constrict the hemorrhoid tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread, and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them untouched: nor touch itself, so that it runs from it an excess of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put on the anus a cloth steeped in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the anus: and order the weak one to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it alone until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the remainder of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often it happens from the dryness of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old and medicine does not penetrate into them: then it is necessary that you rub them with the points of the spatula or with your finger until they become humid and the outer skin which prevents them from consolidating is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them, until they consolidate according to what is suitable.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then treat them again with a more vigorous rubbing than the first, until they bleed much, and then treat them, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and not inverted piles, and of rectal fistulas, and of hemorrhoids.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that a pile is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain happens from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that what is around the nail be cut, and that it be held with forceps, or with a hook, and that it be eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it, and if you want to cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	Of dry hemorrhoids one is a small protrusion, rough, fatty, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment of it is, that you stretch the hemorrhoid, and cut it: or tie it with a thread of silk: or with a probe, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now both inverted and not inverted hemorrhoids are eradicated with an instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A boil is also a small fatty, rough, protrusion on the surface of the body, going deep into the flesh: and when it encounters cold, it feels like the biting of a ant, and it occurs in the whole body: and most often it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment of it is, that you take a small feather from a goose's pen, or a strong vulture's feather: and put that small feather on the boil, until the circle of the feather contains the parts of it.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you reach what is in the circumference of the anal fistula; and you will put it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the fistula from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you need to, do that with a cannula of bronze or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be at the edge, drawing the thread which is wound around it, so that the grasp and rotation of it may be alleviated on the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you need to, cauterize the fistula according to what has been mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments which are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and of purging of the belly, and of colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of gold, or of forged brass, or of hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes they are made small and large from these instruments, according to those for which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	That therefore which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and those whose anuses are weak, or painful, their clysters thus also.
Clistere magnum.	A large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	A small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula of it, that is, the upper head in which the thread is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinction so that the thread can be tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be rounded, that is, not open, smooth, gentle, drawing to subtlety: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the threads, and a little thicker, and there should be a thread in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal: or from the paper of an egg, which is according to the form of small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many holes as it is revolving, and let there be a space which is between every hole the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made from crude thread, which is of ten threads, or around that, and tie to it a thread like astofara.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the thread is placed in it, let it be tightened at the head of the clisters between two pads with strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then inject with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle and the utensil depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of injecting with it, is that you fill the thread or bladder with medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the weak person: and beware that it not be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak person should breathe again on his back, and lift his thighs up to the top, and put under him a cushion, that is, a skin on which men sit, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity of the clister with oil, or with the white of egg, or with the mucus of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the servant should take the thread with both his hands at the same time, and press it out with vehemence, until he evacuates all that is in the clister into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then extract the clister, and let the weak person lift his thighs to his side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	Which if the medicine brings it to the end, then let him hold as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is the more ultimate in juvament.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you inject him with the enemas of the belly during illnesses and its exit is hastened: then repeat the clister until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	What if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostemes, then let it be a subtle and mild suppository, from those suppositories with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a subtle suppository on which the skin is stretched tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the cure of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 83.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	Already I have spoken in the division of the cure of wounds what was suitable for the book, and I will say here the cure of them with the hand, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are distinguished according to that by which they are made into wounds, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are often made are like the throwing of a stone: or the cutting of a sword, or of a knife: or the striking with a lance, or with wood, or with an arrow: and similar to these from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	The wounds which are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I will describe the cures of certain wounds, so that I may set down that reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: since the recollection of compounders will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound in the head and it is not a fracture of bone: consider then if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and has already broken the skin to such an extent: and it is a large wound, and often above the weak event of a hot aposteme: then perform promptly phlebotomy of the head at once: and do not delay it: and let out for it from the blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing that prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak man beware for himself of overeating, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prohibits diminishment, then he will diminish from food, and not approach flesh, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if there happens to it a hot aposteme, a plaster underneath in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are secure from a hot aposteme, then put on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, a powder which I will describe after a little while: and if the air has already changed it, then put on it certain ointments, until it be healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or is from a cut of a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by themselves with pus, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I will describe in wounds of the abdomen concerning their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been torn from the bone, and is hanging, and there is no retention of it, except in a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore to it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the weak person, that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads and cooked wheat, until it be like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	What if you find in the skin rot, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the whole rotten part, and cast it away: then treat that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then tie above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity demands it when it does not conjoin what we have said, then cauterize it, until blood is let.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, slight: so that you powder over them this powder: because it consolidates them before it changes them to air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Powder for Incorporation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: pound all together much, and sift: and fill the wound with it, and bind with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with cloths, and leave it, nor loosen it while it remains, so that it does not become an aposteme.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine should not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it is made with lime alone, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood present, the latter also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to be placed on them and bound, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	What if the air has already altered them by some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then it is not in a position for the intention of this powder: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you place on them certain digestive ointments: or place on them poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the remaining ones with a cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens with a wound and a fracture of the bone, and it is small, then extract it with a gesture: and I will now speak of the cure of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On neck wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a head wound as regards treatment when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity except that treatment for it should be done with what causes violent constriction, such as ziniar and zegi and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they injure the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you should not apply anything cold to the wound at all, since the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuity is with the brain, which is the most elevated of the organs: and let that by which it may be treated be from gentle medicines, such as lotus paste with sweet water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil and tuthia when it has also been washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with poultices.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part in which pus has already collected, then pierce it in the most depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has been cut in the wound and a flow of its blood has followed, then separate it, or cut it off, and ligate it: or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the spongy part of the throat has been cut, or the whole of it, and the alhaudegi have been saved: then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture over a cane in the throat, and do not touch the throat, but reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tie it tightly with a bandage and loosen it after a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments in which there is astringency and excitation, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then perforate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound putrefies and is separated and the protrusion is alleviated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the wound is fresh, then powder over it the powder that I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however a bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with that which I will mention in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On the wound of the shoulder blade.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a thrust of a lance or a knife: and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore a gurgling sound comes out of the wound, when the weak person breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if the depth is not to it, and it is fresh with its blood: then do not put on it powder from the first hour, nor tie it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returned to the heart, and kills the weak person: but put on it an attracting ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed the ointment is not present to you, then put in the mouth of the wound old cloth, so that it sucks up what comes out from it of humidities: and make that the weak person sleeps on the wound, so that what accumulates in it runs.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed the wound has already passed three days, or more, and no spasms have happened to the weak person, nor bad heart tremors, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of its dispositions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treatment is thus applied to it with bandages, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the healing of the ulcer is excavated and it always opens, then you should know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treatment is thus applied to it from its own source.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the breast or the back: then treat it with what has preceded concerning suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has already made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has been cut from it: then probe the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be alleviated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of treatment for wounds occurring in other limbs is the same as what we have already said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On the wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their extrusion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, it happens that the intestine or many of the intestines protrude.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	For which reason the insertion and suture of them is more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows therefore, that the reduction of them is more difficult, if you do not hasten to insert them in their place immediately: because they become inflated, open, and enlarged: for which reason their re-entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	On account of this therefore, a moderate disruption is better than the others: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of a vein is secondary to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common suture methods come together in the suture of a vein, and in the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other suture methods properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper for the suture of a vein: and I will describe to you each one with exposition, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when a wound is small, and something exits from it from the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then it is suitable for one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or because there is inflammation in the intestine on account of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a moist cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil in water the juice of cypress, and cumin, and spike, and chamomile, and apply it to the intestine, until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes make a wine in which there is astringency: and it is better than water alone for resolving the inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that the inflammation has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that the entrance of it is alleviated with something little.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excavated after this cure, then make a small incision in the disruption, with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the incision: and there is no need to cut after necessity and lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the extremity not be with the subtlety of a spatula, but rather more blunt for a little while: and it is that which resembles a reed, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When a wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible, over that, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the weak one lie on their back, and put their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then put its head, and its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then put your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which there is a wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you administer it in great wounds and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make that the assistant, a pious minister, who holds the whole disruption in their hand, be present between your hands, and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then let him who follows, apply to it a suture, something after something, and this is the common method of one suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's depth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then measure from the edge of the disruption a quantity of a finger's width, that is, of the doctor, and insert one needle beyond which you will insert thread in the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the suture, which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two edges of the skin, and two edges of the suture: and they become four stitches.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by a proper joining.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then diminish the thickness of the digit also, and fix a second needle in it: afterwards tie it with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with what you insert from the needles, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and fineness: for thin needles easily pierce the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremes of the skin that are close together: so that the flesh is not quickly pierced, and the wound is opened before its own consolidation, and they do not also become elongated with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the threads, so that they do not injure the weak part by their rubbing: and put little pads made from cloth on all sides, which hold the ends of the threads: and leave them, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is thus more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one or two needles, or about that number, are sufficient for the suture of them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is to gather with the suture four ends: two ends of the skin, and two ends of the flesh in place of one, with a needle in which there is a thread wound equally in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the needle these four ends, bring the needle back from the part where you began, so that the tied thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a suture, just like the suture of cloth which clothes are sewn with, and put between every suture the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I sewed up the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a disruption of the wound larger than one palm, and about two palms of intestine had come out of the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I reduced it back after his intestine had stood outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was then consolidated in the space that it had been for around 15 days: and I treated it, and it healed: and he lived many years after that, living out his natural term.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any of the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I placed therefore an old doublet over the wound, and I applied a frequent washing of it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But I will describe two proper kinds of suture according to the narrative speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle thus penetrates into the flesh, and into the torn apart flesh according to the length and width of the whole body: release the thread from the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer in the other side of the other flesh.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this same thing on the same flesh from the outer part to the inner: and release the thread which is in that side, and make the needle penetrate into the other side from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, which you make it penetrate in the thread of the flesh, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew up the wound with the extremity that is from the suture on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back to that skin, and sew up the extremity of the suture which is on the other side, with this extremity of the thread: and extract it from the skin which is on its own side, and make one knot, and another: and make that knot after the knot, until you have completed the whole thing according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you sew up the pelles like those who sew up skins: so that you put one knot on one side with one extremity of the skin: and so that you pass it to the other side, until you finish.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galenus called.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his has been narrated as they sew them up according to a likeness, which some physicians do, so that they bring all the part to its corresponding part by nature: and apply the extremity of the thread to its other extremity, and the extremity of the needle to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the needle in the extremity of the thread near to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone: and leave two extremities of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle around, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the interior in the two extremities of the thread, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both around, and make them penetrate from the interior to the exterior, into the two other extremities of the needle thread, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better suture than the common easy one, and it is a suture which recall has preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the treatise of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And they said certain things.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the wound is reinforced with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, that you insert into them both one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate up to the other side, following the suture of those who sew the skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know, that when a disruption is in the middle of the wound, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other places of the wound.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound, is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, that when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and sew it, and adapt it: then put on top an incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	Which if the air has already altered the wound: then put on it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they make a pus: and the threads fall, and consolidate the flesh, and form a scar.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however the medicines are not present to you, then put on it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, old grease: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not apply other treatments in many conditions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in a lesion, then it is necessary that you soak a woolen thread in tempered oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and put it around the places which are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	Which if he feels pain, or stitches, or putrefaction in his intestines (for it often happens) then clysterize him with a warm black wine: especially if the putrefaction has already penetrated to the intestine, and an ulcer has been made which penetrates up to the perineum.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from the thick intestine is of easier cure, and what is from them is from the subtle, of more difficult cure.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called the Jejunum does not receive a cure from any wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from the veins, and their greatness, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however what proceeds from the wound is feces, and you treat it freshly: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed the space has passed beyond it, and already it has become green or black: then it is necessary that you constrict it with a thread above the place which has been discolored by it, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in feces there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the attraction of it may be alleviated by you, and the extraction of it in case of feces, and the emission of pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A reminder of the wound which occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there occurs a disruption in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible that it be restored in certain men: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a thrust of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound had become chronic, and a fistula was formed, and there came out from it an evacuation and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I have put therefore a cure, until which I was not confident in the healing of it: nor did I cease to treat it subtly, until it was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the weak, that which would happen to the weak happening a disease in its stomach: and there did not happen to it from that happening a disease.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in its better dispositions, eating and drinking, and blowing, and it entered a bath, and was exercised in its diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain experimenters have said, that when a wound happens in the intestine and is small: then it is necessary that it be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you receive poultices of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and put a poultice one of them which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it thus takes hold on them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another poultice near the first, and do not cease to do that with a poultice after a poultice according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and heal its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is healed and cured, and no harm happens to the weak one inwardly.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be bound with a subtle thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after it has been thrust into a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and much flesh comes out.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind at its end a flax thread subtle and unwound.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then thrust that thread into the needle, and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to a closure.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with poultices and intestine is not but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	One knows a wound that is great, ample, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no ingenuity unless subtlety, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound or aposteme, when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is universally called a fistula, in whichever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is indeed, according to truth, a hardened, white, calloused nodulation: with which there is no pain, to which the concavity of a bird's wing is similar: and because of that some people call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours humid, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity is discharged at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is much, and is little: and it is coarse, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, then when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor flesh grows in it, is not that except on account of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, or on account of the smallness of blood in the body: or on account of its bad quality: or because between it and above its edges there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much filth and foulness: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material which is applied to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable for its cure: or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which there is difficult digestion of diseases, and delayed healing of apostemes by nature: or because in it there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division, and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuke, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of them are Fistulas that extend to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or diaphragm, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the composite joints of a composition: such as the hand, and foot: and some of them are which approach the proximity of the principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is according to this method, is from diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	What if it is from the Fistulas any of which the depth does not extend to these places that I spoke of: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and you use to extend to the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and seek it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is tortuousness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of refined lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with the gentleness of its body, is lifted and bent around the tortuousness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	What if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Probe therefore one of its openings from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you probe it with, goes back to other openings, and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to which method it is possible for you: to know what that is a mouth, or a nerve, and is the concavity of the Fistula far or near: or if it is one Fistula with many openings, and stand on all that, with the greatest strength of yours: with your questioning, which you question the infirm, and the invention of pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes occurring to the apostema.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand over all those stations of that place, then proceed to the cure according to your confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if there is a fistula appearing nearby or in a place far from the junction, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places which I mentioned to you: then cut the Fistula according to what was previously stated from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which grows in its opening from the flesh, or the callus, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of deep and distant profundity, and it is according to rectitude: then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer unbroken bandages in sharp medicines: and insert them up to the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with the iron: do that with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remained in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	When the cause of the fistula is an opening, and it is confirmed by you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	When an opening is detected by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then shave it, until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with that which makes flesh on it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and it emits pus as it was doing: then know that you did not penetrate to the total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Remove that which is above the wound second, and make a precise incision of it, and cleansing of the same with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it heals, it is good: and if not, then you should know that the corruption is in the depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is therefore no ingenuity for you in it, except to entrust it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the small mouth is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it back with subtle forceps that convene to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then make a precise attraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed anything among the humors makes a contrary to you, and there is no fear of incision or error: then incise those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed there is not for you preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then put on the wound what will rot it: and leave it, until it rots what is in the vicinity of those bones from flesh and humors.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the section which you cut in your operation be constrained.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Below put on it, if you wish, a plaster submerged in sulfur beaten with oil: or a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them will be alleviated, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and similar to them, and what of it is corrupted is a large part: then scrape it with a final scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If the bone which is in it is corrupted, and it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it entirely to the place where the corruption penetrates: then treat it, until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you a fracture that happens to a man in his thigh: so that you may put it as an example and aid upon your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a man of youthful age around thirty years, to whom pain happened in his thigh, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the matters reached the thigh and it became an aposteme with a large aposteme: and there was not an external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It was extended therefore with it the time when the error of the physicians, until the aposteme was opened, and many matters converged with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of it was postponed, until the thigh became fistulous, and many orifices were made in it: which all emitted pus, and the humidity of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	A multitude of physicians therefore treated him for about two years, and there was not in it a wise hand in the art, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the matters which flowed from those orifices with a great flow: also the whole body of the man had already wasted away, and its color was citrine.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the places of the orifices, and the probe reached to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the orifices: and I found them to reach to a sinew from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore cut and divided above one of those orifices, until I uncovered a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which already was corroded, and blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I will scrape away what has been detected by me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I have scraped, what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and scraped.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I will now eradicate it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I felt and probed over the bone secondly above the first detection, and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and I scraped what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted the restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I probed therefore over it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it is not restored, until I cut around one palm from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in the operation of it, and its section, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of debility of the infirm, and the paucity of his tolerance, and my fear over it of death: since there happened to him in all hours from an excess of evacuation of bad syncopy.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed therefore by an integral healing: and hard flesh was born in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was converted in his dispositions: and no harm was done to him in walking, not at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the bone is prominent in the place of the body and already fractured: then it is necessary that you scrape it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and tie it on the extremity of the prominent bone: and order someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament made of coarse wool on top of the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is under the bone and stretch out the limb so you pull the flesh to the lower parts and you will find the flesh above the place you want to cut, so the saw does not hurt the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Put a stick or a board under the lower bone decently, for when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be above the corrupted place for a little while, so that the corruption is not in the concavity of the bone, and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels to the sawing of itself rather than another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	For if the bone is corrupted and is not prominent, namely the part of it continues with the part, and the corruption is in the middle of it or in its own part, then strip the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first side, where is the corruption, until the sawing continues from the other side: and let the sawing be according to the length of the corruption for a little while, according to what we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	For if the corruption is in the joint, cut through the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	For if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or in the chest of the foot, then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity you can make straight, when the vein or nerve does not make a contradiction for you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the incisions and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and fineness, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherefore it is necessary that you prepare all kinds of instruments suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you above the form of an instrument which you need, when with you is a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony of the modes of diseases for then you will already find by yourself that which is suitable to it from instruments for every weakness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will establish for you at the end of this chapter a number of instruments which you will cite as examples upon which you rely and a test by which you try other things.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of a saw depicted, is made crookedly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper part be curved, and its sharpness be of iron: and let its handle be of boxwood, and let it be made pyramidal crookedly.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped key: and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an awl.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless the heads of joints rub against it when they are corrupted or the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a middle-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of another razor with a curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small razor, subtle and held.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of a razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and the extremities are like a saw: it is shown in many places from the rasping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a rasp which suits the rasping of that which is perforated by bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its extremities are triangular, and it is sharp at the extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have spoken be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the cutting of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities rot, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medical cures, and the treatment is not effective: and you see the corruption going into the member, which nothing has struck: then it is necessary that you cut that member until where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death, or from the evil which is a greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which this happens is that the member turns black, until it rots: which fire has burned it, or it rots after turning black: until the rot is cut out to that which follows that member, and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	It is necessary therefore with the cutting of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain poisonous things: such as the marine scorpion, and viper, and weasel, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or the sting is in the extremity of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it may not go into the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it out from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades into it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow, then in that there is death of the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from cure, is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do similarly for the foot, when corruption invades into a toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it takes hold in the breast of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if corruption has already passed beyond the knee, then there is not in it a remedy, except abandonment, and to leave the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb, or sawing it, is that you tie a ligature below, which you want to cut: and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant stretch one ligature downwards to the lower parts: and let the other assistant stretch the upper ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures, with a broad flat instrument, until the whole flesh is divided.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be cut, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is proper, that you put a linen cloth on all the parts, and the saw does not touch the healthy place: and an additional injury happens to the weak, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however a flow of blood happens internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it some powders that staunch blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and take care of it, until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man with his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is it, that which happens to its foot blackness, with a burning that is likened to the combustion of fire: and that corruption first happens to its toe, until it begins the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	It has brought out a man from itself, after it saw the corruption befalling the limb with its vehemence, which it found out from the pain, and the burning of it: and it fell upon the joint, and it was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption happened to him on the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came therefore to me, and I attempted to recover that excess with what I placed on the hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the excess did not rebound, and it began to enter into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called therefore for me to make an incision on his hand: and I was unwilling to do it, hoping from me for a rebound of that excess: and I also feared death itself in the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was upon the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After I had given up hope for him, he returned to his land: and he came to me concerning it, that he had hastened, and the whole hand was affected: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not added this narration, except that it may be of help concerning that which falls from the kind of this disease: and that it may be a signification which is signified, and according to which it is acted.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the treatment of abscesses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess happens in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and the empty place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like cloth that has already been worn thin: and it does not penetrate to the utmost in its corruption, nor does it impress on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be named an abscess: and it is not called a Fistula: nevertheless if its space is prolonged, until the corruption impresses on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment of it is that you make an incision into the entire wound as it is turned out, and especially when it has been rendered subtle and made like a cloth, and you are confident because it will not adhere to the place on account of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	And if you suspect that the skin will adhere, and there does not follow from it the last corruption of the consequence, and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster, and it is that you should consider regarding the anus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it is of foul odor: then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and zingar, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel: and decocted over fire, until the medicine reddens: and applied to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the anus with it: and constrict the orifice of it, and let the medicine stay in it for the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for as many days as until the anus is cleaned and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clysterize with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is that you take the ash of grapevines or the ash of holm oak trees: and throw water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the anus is now cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	Which if the weak person is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor water of ashes, then clysterize it with water and honey, into which something has already been mixed from crushed ginger.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize it with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey to clean and wash, and the wine makes the anus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and astringency in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then insert a suppository with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the plaster dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil and styptic wine, or insert a suppository with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatment of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, in which the cannula of the clyster does not fit: then widen it with iron for a little while: or put in it a pledget wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in royal ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and reduce from it the quantity in which the clyster can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then make an incision in the lower place that is in it, so that the pus may run out from it downwards: for when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to make an incision in the sinus around its lower part according to what you wish: then try to prepare a membrane with a preparation so that pus may run out from it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines that are put on the wound, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly at the orifice of the sinus a hole, slightly larger than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the unguents a gentle dressing over another cloth, according to the quantity of the wound: and put it on the same position lengthwise from the orifice of the Sinus, so that the pus may be drained from it: and you will not remove the large dressing, except after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one, however, which is over the orifice of the Sinus, is that which you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus may go out: and so that you know, whether what flows from it is much, or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the location of the Sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is thus extended, and you see the matter which goes out over the orifice of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus already adheres, or approximates to adhesion: then therefore loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however there goes out from the Sinus after a long space subtle pus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however there goes out from the Sinus after many days undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the excitation of medicines, which truly make medics, so that they are medicines in their substance humid, and in their virtue dry: such as the unguent dyafinicon, when there is added to it an excess of addition from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest last of which it is cured, it is that you take the ointment called dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and apply it on top of the old wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now it does a similar action to this, when the ointment dyafinicon is not present to you, honey, when you have decocted it, until it becomes thick, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind all of that, and pulverize it over the honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear it over a cloth, and bind it over the wound: and smear with honey that you have decocted, until it has thickened: and pulverize the spices over it, and put over it a cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered, there are given to it Aristolochia longa, and the roots of lily of heaven, and it is lily: and flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed, grind them, and sift them: and pulverize over the honey that I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the matter of the wound is prolonged, and it is not healed by this cure: then know that there is a corruption in its depth: or now it makes an impression on the bones, or on the remaining hard members, or on the ligaments: then treat it with the cure of Fistulas, according to what has been stated before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of a wounded or rubbed-away nail, and an incised toe, and a cut.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is a tumor that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it grows on the other toes.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it grows, the matter of it is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it suppurates with a hot tumor: or it becomes rotten, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it rots entirely, and perhaps the corruption passes to the bone, until there is a foul smell: and the extremity of the toe becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you raise your treatment with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary to cut with iron all the surplus that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a strong help.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of vacant nail now press on the flesh inside, and begin to pierce it, and wound it: then it is necessary that you put a subtle pumice under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut that flesh with ease, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn and corrode, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already made an impression on the bone, then it is necessary to cut out that bone, and extract it: for it will not be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see corrosion and corruption entering into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to which its movement has been previously established.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however there occurs nail attrition or a blow, and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the weak part first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, a cross-section from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware, lest the cut penetrate to the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause through it severe pain on the weak part, and it will be a cause for the birth of additional flesh in the location.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what calms pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The digit which is added to the birth of some hands of men, is perhaps entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their birth is in some nodes of the digit.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	That which is born at some node of the digit, does not move: and that which is born near the joint of the digit, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	The section of that which of them is fleshy, is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That you should cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of that whose birth is at the root of the joint, is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that which is born on the digit near the last node, then it is necessary to cut the flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The joining together which happens to the digits, often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore to cut away that consolidation, until the digits return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between them a dressing or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or put between them a subtle sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if there happens a joining together of some digits with the palm, then cut away that consolidation, according to what prepares and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the incision of the vein.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are varicose veins, thick and full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body: and they most often happen in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you administer a strong purging of the body from black bile many times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform bloodletting on the patient in the vein of the arm.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cauterized and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein is lifted up and entirely removed.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First apply warmth with hot water to the leg until the thick bloody feculence is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak leg from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three incisions as needed.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then lift, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary that you perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein until below, until a quantity of blood comes out that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the weak person can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile, and also evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, for this harms the weak person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The evacuation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the weak leg if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert it into the bath, or immerse it in its hock with hot water, until it becomes red and the veins become swollen, or let it be exercised with strong exercise, if the bath is not at hand, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in the direction of the vein's section along its length: or at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and excavate the vein from every part, until it appears to sensation: and at its appearance, that which you see is that it turns from redness to blackness downward.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it emerges from the skin, you see it as a white thread.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it the razor, until when it is elevated and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then excavate the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with the razor as you have done, and suspend it with another hook, as you have done at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and cut it at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out from the section which is superior, or higher than all the sections, until when it comes out whole: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to pull out and elevate: then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert the razor under it: and turn your hand to every part, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to heal the wound, and an injury will increase from it on account of its weakness.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted it entirely, then put on the place of the wound a wool cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	What if the vein is contracted, having a twisting where there is an involution to the parts, and it is not as we have said according to rectitude: then it is necessary that you find on it at every part of its twisting, and the place of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you elevate it entirely: and beware at your dissection above it lest you strike a vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to elevate, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incision by which the vein is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of a blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have curvature like the rest of the hooks, nor is it of sharp extremity, so that it does not wound the vein: and it is of gentle flexibility, thick: for if it were subtle, it would strike the vein with its subtlety: indeed let it be a superfluous thickness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the saphena vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot climates, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, in which no herb or tree is born.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is indeed from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just like it happens inside the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The sign of the inception of this vein is an effusion which occurs in the thigh as a severe inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then let the place be looked at.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that inspection, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is one or two drachms, and tie it, and let the suspended lead hang from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	As often as anything comes out from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	What if it is prolonged a great deal, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root until the whole thing has come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess to occur, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it comes out from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein comes out in some men what is five palms and ten in length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has happened to me, that a man came out with it twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it is cut during the time of your treatment, then insert the root into its hole, and perforate it with a long instrument, with a body, until everything that is in it of material comes out: and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the cure for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to it, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Treatment is applied to it, as we said in the division, and with what has been mentioned beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the excision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bouina disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called Bouina disease in a certain land among us: because it often happens to cattle, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it wanders throughout the whole body, going up and down: and it shows itself to feeling during its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks out wherever it breaks out on the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putridness of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes happen, that is, intestinal worms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared on account of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it wanders in the body, and rises to the head, and reaches the location: then perhaps it opens in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to treat it, and extract it, then it is not done unless during its movement, and the appearance of itself to feeling.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, that you bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has become embedded in the flesh, and you do not find it: then apply a cautery with fire to the location, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing that is feared, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it having already reached the head near the eye, then bind beneath it the eyebrow with a good strong bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is suitable that he should use the mild treatment of his body with medicines that dissolve putrid malignant humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware for himself of foods generating putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the incision regarding the disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have indeed already seen it, according to which I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she stretched out her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling entering with a thread, as a worm enters, ascending to her shoulder more swiftly than it can be, so that it is like living silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore receded from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was turning in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I had not seen this disease before with my own eyes in this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who find the pain changing from member to member, and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is anything but because she was one of those who are from villages with a dry body, detecting the veins, hence therefore it appears to the sense that the veininess is changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this method in those who are delicate and in bodies that are humid with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you apply the treatment to it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye, as we have said, then press above it and below it quickly: and cut above it, until the constrained bloating goes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with a purge of the body, and with that which expels bloating, and purges them with foul-smelling pills, and pills made from serapion, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are distinguished according to their kinds and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: that among them are those which have large and small points, and are hollow and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three edges.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those with barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those with little stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the limbs where they fall, are according to two methods.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For the limbs are either from the principal hollow limbs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any one of these limbs, and the signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you afterwards, then it is necessary that you should give up the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows in him in whom it is, in most cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For signs of the brain are when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits through the siphac which is above the brain, there occur: because accidents happen from that, such as heaviness, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a moisture similar to white pus exits from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there exits from it something similar to the decay of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and one feels it as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a hollow thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of a pulse: and black blood runs out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it is followed by coldness of the extremities, and a cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become disordered, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, high spirit: and seeks an attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	For if the arrow falls into the membrane, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is made a great panting with vehement pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will come out of the wound from the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it, something of dung will come out of the wound, or gas, or intestine which is already disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope in its cure, nor in the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	What if an arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger above the weak place: then you should know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and upper arm, and spine of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar ones from the limbs are saved according to multiple arrangements: when the arrow does not find an artery or a nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen concerning the extraction of these arrows, so that you may understand it regarding your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from him on the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not take out anything of it except a small end, with which it adhered to his bone: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no notches.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And there was an Arabic arrow, and it is that which has a head.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I cut above it between two guidings: and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man into whom it had fallen in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed for him, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I applied a poultice to it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was consolidated above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was consolidated above it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not causing him much pain: and many things similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from one of the King's leaders, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had declined to the right side a little: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to his cure after the accident of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow constricted tightly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I searched for it with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it: and he himself felt a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	The instrument is therefore a needle that comes from the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the spot with a plaster in which there was an attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would apostulate and the sign of the arrow would appear to me so I could cut above it, but nothing happened at the spot indicating whether or not the arrow had hit it.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated it then with a plaster for many days, but no effect occurred and the wound was consolidated meanwhile, and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I applied then to that wound a sharp corroding medicine for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed I felt the subtle extremity of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us, and it remained with me for a space of time around four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey for exit: then I did not cease to subtly contrive and ingeniously work on it with modes of contrivance, until I began to work on it one day with well-made forceps, according to which the shape of them will be described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And doctors indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it then, and the wound was consolidated, and the weak one was healed with complete health, and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you may put a rule and significance on it based on what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration, nor does the book comprehend it, and the skilled artisan compares a little with much, and that which is present with that which is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of extraneous things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by extraction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place, and is drawn out, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	For if it does not obtrude to the exit from the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary that you should leave it for some days, until the flesh which is in its vicinity putrefies, and its attraction is alleviated, and its egression.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obtrude to you at the exit, then leave it also for some days, and move it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	For if it does not obtrude to you at the exit after days, then it is necessary that you should perforate in the vicinity of the arrow in the same bone on every side with a subtle drill, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I mentioned appear from below, then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it, until its condition becomes quiet after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow has penetrated to the brain's membrane, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it is only in the body of a bone, and does not penetrate up to the sifach: and he remains weak for some days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then one should use skill in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	And if it is fixed strongly, and does not yield to attraction: then administer a trephine around the arrow, as I have told you: afterwards cure the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	And if the arrow has already been hidden in a location of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then investigate it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	And if you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments which are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	And if you are not able to reach it, on account of the constriction of the wound, and on account of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then probe above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are to them bones which hold it, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, with every ingenuity that you can, and ingenuities, if it cannot be above the separation of the flesh in the fracture of the bones, and their dislocation, until it is extracted.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the dislocation of your hand, with forceps on all parts, until you make it come out: and proceed with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its attraction and extraction are not made difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot reach it in one hour, then leave it for some days, until those things that are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then return to it: for indeed the pus will have relieved the contrary condition for you, if on the other hand a flow of blood makes a complication for you, then administer what we said concerning its cure in its own chapter: and guard your skill from cutting the vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the instrument in every way that is possible to you for the extraction of the arrowhead: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that you do when you pull out the arrow, that it be loose according to the shape, according to which it was in the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is of greater advantage.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the contrary part of another, or now something already proceeds from it to the exterior: or it makes a gibbosity of the extremity of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the adjacent skin, and you see it standing out: cut therefore over it, and let the cutting be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it itself becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow impresses on the bone, and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for some days: then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the wood of the arrow is in it, then drive it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen, and you want to administer a push: then introduce into it a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow: then drive it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then drive it out with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow will be raised by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	What if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, that you hollow out the whole flesh, in which the venom is: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what connects to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins indeed which are bloodlet in the elbow, are in which the custom of bloodletting has run in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the bloodletting of them is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle needle: or inclining to subtlety with an olive: or cutting with a knife-shaped needle, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus it is with Alnesil, which converges to the incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and subtle types according to the width of the veins and their tightness. The form of the myrtle phlebotomy is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it converges to the opening of hollow veins, full, proceeding, apparent, thick and those which contain gross, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy is of lesser width, and more subtle extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it converges to the phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain subtle yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the phlebotomy of Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica, however, which is one of these three veins for phlebotomy, is a remedy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it extracts blood from ailments that are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and stomach: and it converges to the phlebotomist with the phlebotomy instrument, so that he may cut, and is above fear of it, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he misses, and touches the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will wound that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary, that the phlebotomist does not puncture with the phlebotomy instrument: but rather cuts with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	What if the Basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you displace it, and change to another, or that you seek some branch of it: or you make a phlebotomy in place of it on the arm vein.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it itself is manifest, and cut it with the phlebotomy instrument Alnesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you use the phlebotomy of the same itself, then it is necessary before the tightness of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then apply a cautery on the spot with an incision, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using a phlebotome of Alnebil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let the cautery not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, with you tighten the ligature, an inflammation in the place which you signed with a cautery, then that inflammation is the inflation of the artery: avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	For if you see blood at the phlebotomy jumping, like the urine of a child, and it is subtle blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then draw near, and put your finger on it in a long space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is then cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm, and release it: and let the weak one be cautious of its motion: and let it be above its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If the blood does not stop, and overcomes you: and your medicine is not present at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities of it contract, and the blood is stopped.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a fig tree, and crush it: take one half, and bind it with a decent stricture over the place of the vein, with a ligature and poultices until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is stopped, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then treat it with that which the remembrance of the place has preceded, powder to stop the flow of blood: and the stopping of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the smallness of the place of the wound, and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the bloodletting of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The bloodletting of the dark vein is a remedy that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of the royal branch and the cephalic branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the bloodletter to be above the fear from the bloodletting of it, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting and strikes a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed entirely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in certain men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your bloodletting where you will bloodlet with a cut with the Alnesil, and divert the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	For if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the cephalic vein is a remedy because it draws blood from the head and is useful for the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you bloodlet it by puncturing with an olive branch phlebotome, or with a myrtle phlebotome: because it is the saver of all veins, because there is not beneath it an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Truly it is suitable for you at the bloodletting, that you divert with the phlebotome the head of the lancet so much, and seek a thinner place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first puncture, that the bloodletting be repeated over it several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	A true abscess sometimes forms in certain men when not bloodletting is performed on the first percussion, but that abscess does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Of the utility of Bloodletting, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of Bloodletting, however, and its accidents which arise from it, in whose correction you ought to consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore it is of that which you ought to know, that bloodletting is not administered except in conservation of health and its preservation and caution against the approach of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that bloodletting is performed on one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic and the Fusca and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that bloodletting is done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, and in Summer, and Autumn, and Winter after digestion, when the signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting should be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting which is administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour, but when convenience and necessity provoke it, at night or day, and every hour, and every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not fitting that children be bled until fourteen years are upon them.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to be bled for any reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before bloodletting with a gentle clyster, if there is much stool retained in them: so that the veins do not attract from the intestines putrid and harmful superfluities to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should blood be let from a patient who is suffering from nausea, that is to say, disgust; nor one who is drunk or vomiting from intoxication, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor the weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let blood be taken again after colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and excessive coition, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and anything that dissipates virtue from the bodily or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, whether the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines, if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let a bath be taken, if nothing prevents it, or let exercise be used, so that the blood may be thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And let bloodletting be applied to his chest, around the third day, as we have said: and take care, that his chest may be evacuated on that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive coition, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present the things with which usage has created a habit in men from aromaticity, and fragrance, and rubbing and similar things to the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be bled: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tie the bandage with a strap, and turn it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tightening be moderate, because when the tightening is uneven, or excessive in tightness, then it prohibits the flow of blood: and in looseness, it also prohibits the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the hand of the bloodletter rubs his hands together, until the veins become swollen and are apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the bloodletter shall wipe the vein with a little oil, belonging to himself or an old one.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he shall place his index finger of the left hand on the vein under the location where he wants to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein does not escape and the stroke is made.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For there is a vein which when you come upon it during bloodletting slips away like a bowstring: and of them there is one which is full of wind: and when you place the bloodletting instrument on it, it contracts under the blade, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the vein does not show itself: and if it does show itself, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the bloodletter be steady, and be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he shall put down the bloodletting instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein is exposed from one stroke, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then he shall try again another time in that location, or above it with speed, provided the place is not damaged.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if it becomes inflamed, or becomes weak and feeble, then let it be for a day, or two days: and do not constrict the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps heat will attract the inflammation.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let him not enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he shall repeat the bloodletting, if it is loved.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and thinly: and so that not a quantity of blood escapes which is excessive: then he shall try the bloodletting instrument in the same opening, according to what is right, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And let him do it with speed, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is a problem for many men during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see it already suppurating, then do not repeat on it altogether, for it does not excuse anything with you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something upon it from the dregs of oil: because it will alleviate the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your bloodletting, which you let blood to prohibit the flow of blood: and they call it Tyriac Alfarach, and Sagzenea, when it is put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is refined and dissolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if it happens in the place of bloodletting a large abscess, for it often happens, especially to him who is not accustomed to bloodletting except by chance, or is opening a small vein, then quickly and put on the place a sponge soaked in hot water and salt: and bind it for one hour: because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the blood has come out from the same vein, when its flow is complete, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	What if something black or green remains in the place after days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it some aloe, or a solution of myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamint or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often indeed abscesses and swellings occur with bloodletting of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore put your hand on it, then if you find softness with compression on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Beware therefore, that you put on it something of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make for it an plaster with that in which is astringency, so that the place may be indued.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then cure itself with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary, that you extract from every man blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color overcoming the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it exit, until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it exit, until it becomes subtle: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs extraction of blood twice, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified, and the phlebotomist be skilled: and in him who is weak, let it be to the contrary of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary, that he extract it in the veins, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is, that it be a cross-section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more to be praised, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to faint at phlebotomy of the syncopis, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy moderate bread infused in water of granate or of musk, if it is warmed: and extract for him from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is a cold complexion, then let him receive before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrha, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in syrup aromatized with perfume.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	What if it happens a faint at phlebotomy, and is the cause of its exit of much blood: then it is necessary, that he take in drink water of flesh, and subtle perfume syrup: and that he use aromaticity with galbanum, and that his breast be lined with it: and that he use the remaining things which we said in the division in the chapter of faint from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to purify his arm and release his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to abundant evacuation, and the virtue of it is weak, that he should release blood little by little according to the quantity of virtue in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Who indeed wishes to purify his arm and release his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then let him do that after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to attract blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he should be purified on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whom there is indeed much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood should go out from it in a single vein, and a large quantity be extracted from it: and the opening be widened until syncope occurs: after which you have observed all conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when the vein has been closed, and the second release of blood is to be made, with the orifice of the vein already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it should be pressed upon with violence, and the curved needle extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a grievous evil, leave it alone, until a second phlebotomy is made.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with acuteness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated from the blood at the orifice of the vein, and put on it something of salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on it something of tyriac alfarch or sageena, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood goes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If the vein has already become varicose, then leave it, and do not touch it, until the aposteme has settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity provokes to let blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy on it above that place, or on another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arms are bled at the places of the Funis, and Basilica, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is, that an weak hand should be put into warm water, until it becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let it be constricted above itself with a bandage of moderate tightening.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then let the phlebotomy be done across gradually, not across the width, nor along the length: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be where you will phlebotomize above the joint of the hand for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the flow of blood is stopped, then put the hand again in warm water, and let the blood flow in the water, until you obtain your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however it is in the days of summer, then you should be spared from putting the hand again in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And for the most part, the flow of blood is put into warm water in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is salvation to all veins, because there is neither a pulse beneath it, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the right Salvation vein is conferring with the liver's illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is, that you constrict the hand with a bandage, or your hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the vein becomes inflated, and shows itself to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then let the bloodletting be done by crossing over.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, lest you wound your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put the hand into warm water, and let the blood flow out into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not put it in warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the amount of blood necessary, then put oil and salt on the vein, so that it does not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The justification of its bloodletting from the left hand is that it contributes to diseases of the spleen: and do similarly in its bloodletting as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The justification of bloodletting from the saphena vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the matrix, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its bloodletting is that the weak foot should be immersed in warm water: and friction should be made on it until the veins are swollen: and bind above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it on the sole of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore perform bloodletting on its larger branch, or near the heel at its collection: because it is better and more healthful.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	For if you perform bloodletting on the sole of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your venesection where you want to make an incision across it, as if you wish to cut it, and let the cutter be a NESIL.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If on the other hand the flow of blood is impeded, then soak its foot in warm water, and let the blood run into it until it evacuates.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	What if the bloodletter misses the vein at the first time, then let him repeat with venesection towards the upper parts for a little while, for the location is safe, and you will not take harm from it when you cut a nerve, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the wooded side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the indication for venesection of it is, for pain of the hip, when it is because of hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its venesection is, that an weak person should enter the bath and be bound: and let the leg be constricted from the side of the hip up to above the heel four fingers, with a subtle long thread: for it does not appear unless because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then venesect it according to whatever ingenuity is possible for you, or according to the crossing: and it is better, or that you cut it with an incision, or that you section it.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is salvageable, and it itself is hidden very much in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	What if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then venesect some branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, and turned towards the ear: and beware of the nerve, and make the blood flow in quantity as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and put a bandage over the place of venesection, and constrict the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of letting blood, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cauteries are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is bloodletting without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this bloodletting which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the bloodlettings that are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood, are fourteen places in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the bloodletting of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the bloodlettings of Alhagdahim, and they are two sides of the neck from both parts together: and the bloodlettings of the jaw, and it is under the jawbone in the lower mouth: and the bloodlettings of the two spaulders: and the bloodlettings of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the bloodlettings of the two elbows, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the bloodlettings of the two thighs: and the bloodlettings of the two hams.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And bloodletting indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, no virtue falls from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer bloodletting, either with fire or without fire, in any of the diseases that occur from overfullness, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	Which if necessity calls for bloodletting because of disease or because of habit, let us administer it at every hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is it, that which is from humans who when blood is multiplied in them to the point that it needs extraction through venesection, finds in its head a heaviness and swooning.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there is one of them who finds fullness and redness in his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there is one of them who finds itching in his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is one of them who scratches the place of his venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one of them whose sneezing is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there is one of them who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or it gathers on his tongue, and he spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one of them whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there is one of them who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and killings, and wounds, and things that are similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see any of these things, and it is specifically in the third quarter of a month, we prescribe that venesection be done, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The indication for venesection of the neck is: since it brings about heaviness in the head, and what flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it be after purging of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this venesection is in place of bloodletting of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that it be used by one who is of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a flux.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings to him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not fitting that the elderly use it, and those in whose head there are cold ailments.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	He who does it frequently over it, brings about for himself forgetfulness.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And on account of that it is necessary to warn the person performing the procedure, that he should place his hand with the veins for a short time in a lower position, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The application of the cup or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomy of the dark vein and the royal vein, and on account of that it brings together the spasm and constriction of breathing, and the fissure of the instrument of breathing, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the cup of Alkehel be applied for a short time, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The application of the cup, indeed, brings together pains that occur in the head, and diseases of the eyes, and half headaches, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of royal phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to warn the one performing the cupping, that he should not press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The application of the cup under the chin brings together ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar things from ailments which are in the mouth: and it is in place of the phlebotomy of the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The application of the cup to the shoulders brings together the disease of alchafacham, which occurs from congestion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The application of the cup to the inner parts of the two armpits brings together the substitution of phlebotomy of the three veins, the royal, the dark and the cephalic: because it itself attracts blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and those small veins attract from other thicker veins, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to warn the one performing the cupping, that he should not proceed far with the scarification: because the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A poultice is applied to what is swollen above the anus, and it relieves hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to instruct the applier of the poultice that it should be large and made of air, because the location requires strong suction, and subtle poultices are easily torn, and a large scarification should be scarified.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Poultices of the legs diminish with manifest diminution: because they draw blood from the whole body, and relieve old pains in the kidneys, and uterus, and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and relieve a flux, and amenorrhea: and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphena veins, and aloxocheni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body, and cause syncope to occur in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of poultices of the vein behind the knee is similar to the benefit of poultices of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of poultices is that you should put a poultice in a vacuum, and draw with tempered suction: and you should not prolong the positioning of poultices, but rather put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place equally: and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the place already red and inflamed, and the appearance of blood appears: then scarify, and repeat the suction little by little.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh and rare pores among men, it is necessary to scarify the place once, no more: so that the location is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the applier of poultices to amplify the scarification and make it a little deeper: and to temper the suction with facility, speed, and its own motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	What if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify the place twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In this case, what is first investigated is the subtlety of blood and its thinness: and in the second, what is investigated is the scrutiny of extracted coarse blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very foul, then let there be made a third scarification: so that it may follow the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And in the end, when we wish to extract blood little by little, or for a short while, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	What if we wish the extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is coarse: then it is necessary that there be made a deep scarification: and the limit of equality in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that thing which ought to be administered from oils at the placing of the bandages, and what the bandage covers.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case in which the skin is coarse, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it is necessary that the places of the bandage be anointed with oils which are opening, loosening, resolving: if it is in the summer season, such as is the oil of cloves, or the oil of violet, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of the seed of gourd.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of chamomile, or sabbatical: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is coarse, cold: then let the oil be bitter, or the oil of balsam, or the oil of abeny, or the oil of dill: and their similars.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the bandage is of large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that it be prohibited from oil, and it is necessary that these places of the bandage be washed after the bandaging with rose water, or with cold water, or with solatri water, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and their similars.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much humidity, should wash the ventoses with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumach: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose superfluities are gross, should wash his ventoses with old wine, or with water of samsuc, or decoction of anet, or camomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is fitting that the ventosation should be received in a bath, or in a dressing room of a bath, and it is fitting that it should be administered after the exit from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fitting that anyone should sleep after ventosation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that one ought to be governed by, the Ventosed or the one who will be bled before ventosation.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is fitting that you consider first: then if the Ventosed or the one who will be bled is choleric, and there are conquering on his blood acuteness and inflammation: then it is fitting that he should receive cooling things, such as granulated mucilage: and also an enema with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And let his food be soft porridge, and meat of boiled eggs, and seasoned foods with verjuice: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is fitting that he take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be prescribed to use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And let his food be soft porridge, and cane sugar: and peas, that is, small birds: and the soft porridge of doves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is fitting that the drink on the day of ventosation and phlebotomy should be more than the food: and it is fitting that there should be given in a drink to certain men at the third hour alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscad, or alesselithe before ventosation: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be comforted, and the blood may be thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it should not be taken in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On inflammation without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Inflammations which are without incision, are those that are applied on the liver, and spleen, and gout, and on the navel, and the umbilicus, and the kidneys, and the groin: because these members do not tolerate incision on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought for through them, unless there is an attraction of blood from one member to another member: as we apply a plaster on the breasts in case of a flow of blood from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to dissolve a cold inflammation from a member into another member: as we apply a plaster on the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain for that reason, because it resolves that inflammation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also applied on the kidneys, when there occurs in them a stoppage or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by the virtue of its attraction it perhaps opens up the blockage, or extracts the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does similarly when it is applied on the liver and spleen for a tertian fever in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these plasters should be given to those who are with incision, only so much.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with warm water full in cases of pleurisy: and that is, so that the plaster is filled, and is large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a plaster administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers, according to which we form it: and its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side in the place which is around the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that the needle enters: let it be made from copper or brass, of thick edges, smooth, equal, polished: so that it does not harm the member at its position on it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of copper or iron, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large suture is made, greater than we have described, and a little less, according to the ailments and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For there are different sutures for children and for the thin, than for men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of applying this suture with fire on the member, is that you set alight a small piece of linen with fire from a lamp or a small candle made of tallow: and place it above the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the suture: so that the fire burns around the lower part of the suture, so that the body of the weak person does not get burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the member: and the finger is above the hole that I mentioned, until when we hold the suture: while we press, we remove the finger, and vapor will come out over that hole, and the suture will be loosened immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply a small piece of linen to the fire according to its size, and remove it, if you press on it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the suture that is administered for the ailment of dropsy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered, unless it is filled with water, and placed on the member only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this suture, the larger it is, so that it can hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of bloodletting.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting is not administered to many, unless it is in those members where the application of sutures is not possible, due to their smallness, such as the lip, and gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should use bloodletting from the veins that are in clear and clean waters, free from corruption.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be soaked day and night in fresh water until they are softened and nothing remains in their stomach.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be treated at first with bloodletting and with applications to the belly.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the weak member should be cleansed until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards they will be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with an application, then it is almost the end of the treatment: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after a fall of the blood vessels, and it is that which flows back: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it on top, until the flowing back is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood increases, then powder on it aseh powder, or alum, and similar things from astringents: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they will be placed on the place half-cooked broad beans: and left until the beans stick to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of bloodletting is needed, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however the blood vessels are forbidden from suspensions, then the place should be cleansed with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or apply a sharp point to the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be applied, for as soon as they feel something from the blood, they stick at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you use them so that they fall, powder on them something from powdered aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall at once.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The end of the second part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that the foolish medical men and the common people mock this chapter, and who have never inspected any ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is deprived of the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not find anything good in it at all, and I would not have attained what I attained if not for the length of reading ancient books, and study beyond understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experimentation and study for the duration of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this Chapter all that my knowledge contains: and on which my experimentation has passed, after I had shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of prolongation, and shortened it at the end of shortening, and showed it at the end of declination: and formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered in it, when it is with the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	A sum and collection from the being of fractures of bones, from which a preliminary necessity is, before we begin the remembrance of fractured members, and diverse ones, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting that we say in the prologue of this Chapter, the sum of the discourse and chapters, for the understanding of which the artisan is compelled at first to stand on their truth: namely so that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary first to bleed him and/or to treat him, both at the same time if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if he is one of those persons who has a fever, or an old decrepit man, or if it is a time of violent heat or of violent cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content with his food of cooling herbs, and flesh of birds, and of fish: and prohibit wine, and fat meats, and fill him with foods and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from the hot aposteme, and you do not fear the effusion of material to the member: then let the weak man return to his first regime with which his habit was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the weak man be fed with nutritious foods of much nourishment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscidity: such as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and cabbage, and feet and hocks of geese, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regime a consolidation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they knit and consolidate according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their membranes: and they consolidate and knit which of them are at the end of softness, such as the bones of little boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Truly, however, nature joins to the broken bone from every part something like glue, in which there is thickness, with which it adheres and binds itself, until they knit together and bind together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, as they were at first, until nothing prevents them from their operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishing food for the weak man, in which there are thickness, and viscidity, and grossness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that there are different types of fractures, according to the diversity of organs, because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone, and similarly all the other organs are different from one another, and I came with remembrance of each species of fracture exposed in its distinct Chapter, separate from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures also differentiate among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it becomes a fracture that is curved, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture occurs according to the length of the bone, and its fractures are jagged, that is, stars, and additions proceed, as they are in a reed, when it is adapted to a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding, and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and it is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each species has its own ingenuity, or proper instrument for its restoration, according to which comes the remembrance of it, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which the fracture of the bone is recognized, is its twistedness and its own prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore the twistedness is not apparent in its place, nor sound upon your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the weak one find great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there be a twist or small fissure: therefore it is not necessary to move it with hand and compression at all, but rather put on top of it from medicines, which remembrance came after the moment that it is suitable for the place: then let the strict bandage be tightened.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that the place when it is curved and splits into two, besides which stars occur in it, nevertheless every part is moved away from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, equalizing it before hot apostema occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for some days until the abscess quiets.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then treat it equally according to whatever method is possible from gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than of a bone, in which occur fractures.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what the memory of it will indicate to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are fractures in the bone, then extension of this broken member is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or foot: or with your hand, if it is a small member: or with two cords, or with a cord and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be where you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, that you make those additions return with all ingenuity, and according to whatever method you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, that pain or injury does not happen to the weak one through your operation: and try according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time, that you touch and feel it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the quantity of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many stupid ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a hot abscess to happen through their operation, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalization, and decent operation, and straitness of that member, and quiet, and tranquility: and warn the weak one above it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let it heal so that it does not move during the time of its watchfulness and its sleep with regard to its revolution and its agitation and with regard to its ejection and all its movements with its final strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let it heal so that the position of the limb is not a position in which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is, that when it feels pain or injury in the disposition of the limb's position, then it is necessary to change it to a different disposition from that in which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And let it heal with that, so that its position is equal and straight, so that crookedness does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the broken limb is according to which I will describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs differ in their smallness and size and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm and finger and elbow and similar things, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft cloth, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those of them which are large, such as the hip and thigh, it is necessary that there be a wrapping on them of broad, hard cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a broad bandage connects the large limb and binds it on every side with equal constriction, so that it does not press upon it unevenly.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after your adjustment to put a plaster suitable for it on the soft cloth over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap a bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves, and bind your hand firmly with the bandage for a short time.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go up with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture and bind less tightly than was your constriction, with which you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with an involution from the place of the fracture for a little while, and gradually soften the stiffness, until you take from the healthy place a large thing.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth, and involution it again over the place of the fracture with involutions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards lead with an involution to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be on the tightening of the involution and its softening, according to what we said in the first involution above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the involutions a piece of flax or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is equalized, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, you do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then involution another cloth over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards equal the stars made from the plaster directly over these involutions, if there is not an inflammation in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is an inflammation or an abscess in it: then put on it what will calm that abscess and take away the inflammation: and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it the plasters at that time.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the plasters be from the middle parts of latten cane, scraped, formed wisely: or let them be from wood from which are made cribs, which are made from pine or gerahid, that is, branches of palm, or calingi: and let the width of each plaster be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Truly it is necessary, that the plaster which is put on the same fracture, be a little thicker and wider than the other plasters: and the length of the plaster be according to what is suitable for the member from its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the plasters with another cloth, according to the first tightening, the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind from above with threads in the middle, according to what we said about the dressing: and it is, that your dressing should be above the place of the fracture more: and the more it is elongated from the fracture, the dressing is less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is fitting, that the threads should be moderate in thickness and fineness, and should be of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of foolish surgeons who put their threads of flax twisted into strings, it is a great mistake: for the dressing falls with them beyond the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads are not suitable either: for you will not achieve through the dressing with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not fitting, that it should be between stitch and stitch less than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if a weak person is injured by the ends of the stitches after the dressing on healthy places: then put under them from soft lint or wool, anointed with salve, until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I will come to it with discussion of it in the second chapter according to its uniqueness.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken member needs to be bound with stitches from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	What is, that when the member is large, it is not fitting to put stitches upon it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored, which are put on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of a common plaster abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: for it is from that upon which neither heat nor cold prevails.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the powder of the millstone, and it is the marrow of the flour which hangs in the walls of the mill near the motion of the mill: and you knead it as it is, except that you mix it with the white of the egg: and you put its confection not thick, nor subtle.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take mastic and laudanum and acacia and elecampane and mugwort: and juice, of each a similar amount, myrrh and aloe of each a similar amount, and of electam a third of that, let all be pounded, and sifted, and mixed with water of electam: or with the white of an egg, if the plaster is applied to a weak complication.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and confirms many men.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also confirms fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort and mastic and white plant, of each a similar amount, myrrh and aloe of each a similar amount, acacia a sixth part, Armenian bolus a twentieth part, let all be pounded with much grinding, and sifted, and kneaded with water, or the white of an egg: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it calms the accidental pain to them, and the cracking of bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let lanolin be applied, and submerged in vinegar, and oil cooked: and put upon the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is not virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot abscess: and it properly expels pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig and the leaves of the poppy, and pound all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of abbreviated plaster, administered for the restoration of the fracture of a bone: and when you wish to resolve a remaining postulate.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of the altea, and chamomile, and the flowers of violets, and the powder of the herb, all in one portion: pound all, and mix with wine, if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is hot, then mix it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and apply it thereto.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of a stronger plaster for resolution, than the first one, when there occurs a hard postulate during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of the altea, and seed of flax, and balsam, and melilot, and samsuch, and flowers of violets, and chamomile, all in one portion, pound all, and mix with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the heat of the member, and the tranquility of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be put on a fractured member for its restoration, except a cerate made from wax and oil: none other: and he described it as being a mean between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen used to put on a fractured member for its restoration things, in which there is an exciting of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar to them from those which we have described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of plaster that is useful for a wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, and cichory, and cut human hair, or dove's wings, and altea, and salt in equal parts: pound, and sift, and mix: and make from it a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however according to which it is necessary that the ligature remains and then is dissolved, is, that you consider then, if not severe pain occurs, nor itching, nor the fractured bone moves from its place: then you do not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If there happens to it in the place intense itching, or troublesome pain, or swelling: then hasten and dissolve it within the hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a marine sponge, moist: and submerge it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching is stilled, and the pain is assuaged.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a wool cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind over it for one night, until you are secure from the hot abscess, and the inflammation of the limb is stilled, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to a subtle binding and small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, but subtly, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess and redness and pain and swelling and all accidents are entirely removed, and you apply plaster and binding, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we have spoken of happen to the limb, then do not dissolve it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, all of that which appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: add then also in the binding more than your whole first binding: and add also in the thickening of the weak body, according to what its remembrance has preceded.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the place of the fracture is already becoming dry and withered more than it should be then you should know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Apply a warm poultice to it at every place where you reduce the fracture and let it be thus for three days, and alleviate the tight bandage for a little while.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation nourishment runs to the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What foolish restorers do when a limb is fractured and not restored at first as it ought to be, but instead is restored according to its deformity, is an error in their operation and a great danger: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them at all, and it is better that it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the fracture of a wound on the head.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are various and its shapes are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just like an axe does in wood: and because of this it is named this species of fracture Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword strikes a part of the bone and strikes its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to the end of it: and this species of fracture is named Kalan, that is, Absolute Separation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture that is a crushing or bruising: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and there is a wound of these two fractures also, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And there is a fracture which occurs from a fall, or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to penetrate to the interior, and it becomes concave in that place: just as happens to the caldarii of copper, when a blow occurs to them, and a part of them penetrates to the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And it happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there are for all these types of fractures treatments separated, and I will come with a reminder of the whole thing in its own place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures by detection upon them, and an inquiry into them with probes, and the removal of corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of Capillary fracture is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and wiped away, and anointed upon it with a plaster: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the weak person: then if you see from the accidents something that signifies a manifest sign of fear, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching, and loss of intellect, and interruption of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these from accidents in many conditions, without doubt it is not cured: and if you see accidents not terrifying you, and you hope for health: then begin the treatment of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	Which is, if the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you should strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the bandage becomes rotten, and those accidents which we have described happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has already reached the bandage touching the brain, and is with damage, and pulling: then it is necessary that you cut the damaged and pulled part, according to what I will tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you shave the head of the wounded, and uncover the bone as much as is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound, and what is least above the weak part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if there occurs to you during the uncovering of the bone a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then apply to it what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess settles, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, that you cut the bone with a strict razor-shaped incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incisor wider than the first one, but only for a short time: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incisor even wider also than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and let them be sharpened at the ends, and let them be made from hardened iron or steel: and use facility in striking on the incisor, so that it does not strike the head, and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary that you perforate around it before you apply the incision instrument, with non-penetrating awls which are called non-penetrating awls; and they are not called thus, except that they themselves do not penetrate beyond the limit of the bony tissue to what is behind it: because the awl has a round extremity above what is under its pointed head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submersion and penetration of the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is suitable for you to take a large number of these awls, each one of which suits the thickness of the bone, until there is an awl available to you for every skull: whose pointed extremity's quantity in length and width is, according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of awls, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating around a fractured bone is: that you place the awl on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the awl to another place, and put what is between every hole a quantity of thickness of the radius, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with incision instruments what is between every hole in the bone: and make it thinner than you can above that from the fineness of lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand, or with some other one of the instruments which you have prepared for it: such as pincers and subtle borers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you proceed with all caution, lest the awl or incision instrument touch anything of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have perforated around the bone and it has been separated from the brain, if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth out the extremity of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incision instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	The needle should be thin and finer than those of other surgeons.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	What remains from the small bones and sawdust, then take it with ease, along with what you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments which we mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, far from fear, which Galen said and praised it with great praise, and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to remove the piece of bone from the place where the fracture is most violent and most apparent, until when you have removed that piece and placed under it the extremity of this grooved incisor, of which this is the shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the grooved part does not cut gently, and its pointed part on both sides of it proceeds along the length, as you see, so that the grooved part is attached to the saw, with its pointed face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the incisor on one side with a small hammer, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns out, and you will be safe from the accident that you fear, namely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the doctor were not more stupid than men and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the bandage in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the extremity of the grooved incisor itself, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and remaining in it are roughness and subtle sawdust, then it is necessary that you scrape away that roughness and remove those sawdust with fine rasps which you have prepared in a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them in every place more conveniently and more correctly, according to what the operation leads you to, and the bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you manage with a rasp, which in the first place has a wider tooth than those of other rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use afterwards something more subtle than it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to make that a second time in succession until you reach making something thinner and more subtle than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each and every one of the remaining small fissures or tiny little fractures, it is necessary that you administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden from everyone, that in this art there is something to be studied, and it stands upon what we have written, and we show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If indeed a piece of cloth is detected and retained when you extract the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and put it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and put it on the first cloth: and do that as easily as you can over it, so that it does not press on the spleen.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a wide bandage: and do not bind it, except in the amount that will hold the wound so much: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then undo it, and administer after that medicines with which there is a dry excess, such as the roots of lily, and flour of herbs, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is that you make from these medicines a powder, which will be powdered over the wounds as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer on it every medicine of a property which is that it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your virtue, that the wound is in your cure clear: nor is there in it filth of ointment, nor foulness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow the pus to gather in it at all: for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it, and putrefies it, and a great evil happens to the weak after that; and now it happens in the cerebral membranes, when the mouth is cleansed from it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider then, that if there happen to the weak the accidents which we have said, you should know, that it is pernicious without a doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not happen, except from the medicine which is put on it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, that it makes that blackness: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and anoint the cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the cerebral membrane: afterwards cure it with the species of cure which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not fractured except when its two upper parts break at the same time, or one of them: because it itself has two bones: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous, does not fracture, and nothing happens to it except bruising, and twisting, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is fractured, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural figure: and this should be done with skill.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, that pain does not happen to the weak because of your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	What if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach to that finger then it is necessary that it be adjusted by a small thickness of the radius.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that and restore it immediately on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day with rest of a warm apostume.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the extremity of the nose a linen pledget from a linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the pledget a thickness of such quantity that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers have said that the pledgets should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That however does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary that the pledget be soaked in the white of an egg mixed with powder of meal.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the pledget until the bone becomes firm and the cartilage becomes hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose in place of a pledget, after which a soft cloth is wrapped over it: and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more vigorously, and so that it does not prevent the weak from inhaling.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, do that: and if you want, do pledgets.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if it happens to the nose again while you are operating with a warm apostume, plaster the nose with a cerate, or with a paste mixed with rose oil, or with a little of dyaculum.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however the warm apostume does not happen, then it is necessary that you plaster it with flour of sesame and powder of frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on top of it a linen cloth, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are slightly fractured or broken, then it is necessary to split over them, and extract them with instruments that suit them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew up the wound, and cure it with what promotes flesh, and consolidates it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if there happens to be a wound between the nostrils, then it is necessary to cure it with threads: and administer a tube of lead, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken apart.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken apart and its fracture is not with a wound, then consider if the fracture of it is only a slight defect and does not break into two, and is curved inwardly: then the treatment of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the lower mouth: similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the curvature of the fracture from within with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner side of the bone, and straighten it with that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	What if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to straightness: until its equalization is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however there has already occurred a shaking or disruption of the teeth, then tie them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put on top of the fractured jaw a cerate.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put on top of it a double-folded cloth, and put on top of the cloth a large splint made to fit: or a piece of leather sole equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to the preparation you make for its bandage, and let its application be suitable until it is not destroyed: and order the weak person to have tranquility and quiet: and put his food in soothing sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something of its shape has already changed in some way: then hasten, and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been changed in it, and plaster it with dust of rose powder, or with the flour of barley, after you have removed the hair: and put a soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	So long as that plaster remains attached to it, and the bone's arrangement is not changed, leave it, do not remove it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its treatment, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now a fragment is already separated from the bone, or from the edge: then be subtle in this, so that you remove those fragments of the edge with what suits you in the removal of them by means of instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a lancet according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those fragments, and none of them remain, or then the opening of the wound, if it is wide: and if not, put on it some plasters that suit it, and let it heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Jaw, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Jaw is indeed broken most often from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it either breaks and separates into two, besides which accidents happen to that fissure: and it is easier for the restoration of it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or those things that happen to the bone of the fissure: and it is more difficult for the restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when there is a fracture without a wound, is that you should have two attendants present, so that one of them may hold the help that follows the fractured Clavicle, and the other stretch the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equal the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and it should not be in eminence, nor concave.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What if you indicate extension more, then it is necessary that you put under the weak little cloth a sphere of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to the quantity of your necessity: and extend and elevate the Clavicle, and bind the sphere with your hand, until it equals the fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw the extremity of the Clavicle to the outside: because it penetrates to the depth: then it is necessary that the weak one should lean on his neck: and you put under his shoulder a middle-sized pillow, and an attendant presses his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the Clavicle which is in the depth rises upwards: and then rectify the fracture, and equal it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a false movement from the Clavicle, and it moves: then it is necessary that you bind over it, and extract that false movement with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then make an incision of it with one of the Incisors which you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Clavicle an instrument that preserves the siphach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It becomes like a spoon for one who has no spoon.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need it from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the sequestration of the bone is wide, and you are far from the hot aposteme: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you are near the hot aposteme: then fill the wound with rags, and poultices according to the quantity of the division of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot aposteme happens, then soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is, that you put on the bone a plaster made from flour of millstone with the white of an egg.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft dressing over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under its nipple, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bow, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which should be very long: and let its width be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double poultice over the dressing and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a rod from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the rod in the place of the bow that falls on the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the splint over the fracture as it is turned, and wrap it around his neck, and under his sound shoulder, and under his weak shoulder: and bind it over every part, and however you see that the bandage holds the fracture, the bandage is sufficient: and it is that which is not hidden from you, and all, so that the star is not removed from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, it is necessary that you examine the weak part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	How often therefore the bandage is loosened, and you see the star already being removed: then correct it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put a pad on the weak part over his back, and put under his shoulder near the weak part a small pillow at night, so that with it his helper is elevated from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the arm is therefore elevated by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage, unless an accident occurs on account of itching or from a gathering, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see that it is suitable for it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and diminish it, until it is restored and united.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the arm is bound and strengthened mostly within twenty days: and sometimes it happens in certain men in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely broken, and in its broad place: and they are not broken except for their edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is broken from that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch: then according to what is the figure of the fracture, prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And I reduce it to a natural figure in every way possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place a dust of grinding with the white of an egg, and a linen cloth, and put above it a small pillow from a double cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a broad star made from a subtle board according to the quantity of the entire spatula or a little more.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed under the star there is a concavity in some place of the spatula, then equal that concavity with a linen cloth, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind above with a long alum paste, a decent constriction, and firmness of the star, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the ligament is softened, bind it, and equal the star if it is moved from its place: and let the weak one lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then solve the ligament: and you will be in security.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is one of the bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If a fragment proceeds from the bone and pricks under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the jaw from the application of a warm poultice, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest is rarely broken in the middle of itself, and it hardly ever happens to it.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are most often broken and joined from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which declines to the lower parts, and a violent pain happens to it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps it vomits blood, and is declared in the fractured bone, and is not hidden from sensation. The restoration of it is, that the weak one should rest on his back: and put between the spatulas of it a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from the two parts or sides with the hands, and reduce them in their equality, according to every manner that is possible for them and is suitable, until the shape of the bone returns, according to what is proper.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put on it a plaster and a dressing, and put over it a splint made from a thin board of willow or hazel, or similar things, lightly, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then bind it subtly over the fractured bone, so that it is not removed: and see to it with a bandage according to the roundness of the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and as often as it becomes loose, tighten it: and if necessity demands its removal on account of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and remove it, and eradicate the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then put back the plaster, if you see it is suitable for that face: and attach to it a dressing, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Of the restoration of the ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, except in thick places which follow the back, and from the extremities of them on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And damage does not happen to them, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from feeling on examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way, that you press the fracture with the fingers according to the possible method, until it takes on the shape, according to what is proper.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and bind the fractured bone with a splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined to the interior, then intense pain occurs to the weakened person, and puncture, just like the puncture that occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty in breathing occurs to them, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have devised many devices for it: and among them there are those who say that you should apply foods to the weakened person which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and distended, and the fracture pushed outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed disapprove, that a cause for making a hot abscess does not happen quickly, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a poultice be placed on the swollen place, then sucked with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Truly, it is feared that the poultice will attract the excesses of the swelling to the location, because of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the location be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil: and small pillows are placed between the ribs, until it is full: so that the bandage is equal when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the weakened person should be treated with a cure for pleurisy, from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	Since the intense thing constricts the weakened person, which it does not tolerate, and the bone pierces the membrane with a wounding puncture, and we fear for the weakened person: then it is necessary that we cut above the location, and remove the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place on it an instrument that preserves the health, whose memory has gone before: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we shall treat it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	What if a hot aposteme happens in the meantime, then apply it, and pour into rose oil poultices, and put over the place: and let the weak one be treated with that which is suitable for the aposteme.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also let him breathe on the side above that which he sleeps, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	When a fracture occurs to the bones of the neck, and rarely does it happen to them with an injury: and similarly to the vertebrae of the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore that happens to anyone, and you wish to know, whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened and numbed and deadened: and he cannot move them nor extend them nor clench them: and when you clench them with your fingers and prick them with a needle he does not feel it and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	For if he moves them and feels in them a constriction with the fingers and a pricking: then know that the marrow of the bone is safe, and that the weak person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	For if it happens to the vertebrae of the back similarly to that, and you wish to know whether it will heal also or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and it happens in them what happened in the hands: afterwards when he lies on his back, flatus and vomiting come out without his will: and when he is turned on his belly, vomiting comes out without his will: and when he is turned on his back and wishes to urinate and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	I do not therefore undertake his cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If on the other hand nothing happens to him from it, the thing is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from it is that you apply a dressing of hot aposteme: thus, that you put on the affected spongy part rose oil alone: or with roasted egg whites.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply on it that several times a day, until when the hot aposteme is applied: then apply over the place one of the comforting, drying, and constricting plasters, and bind over it with a bandage: and instruct the patient to use quiet and rest.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side on which he feels pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	What if it happens at the place of fracture of a bone, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut over the skin, and to remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some kind of ointment, from the oils, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If on the other hand the end of the bone is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and straighten the fractured bone with your other hand, according to what is possible, and a second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on it, and bind it: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of the restoration of the nail.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the donkey are rarely fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	What if they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except a comminution at their extremities: and they split along the length, and bend inwardly: and there happens to the patient pain in the place, and puncturing: and the leg which is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is that you extend your hand over it, until you are above the fracture in whatever manner its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from equalization, until it is assimilated to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is in the length, or it declines to the inside: then make the weak one lie on its belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, put a plaster on it: then put above it a splint of wood or of leather: and bind a bandage over it which you do not fear to change the fracture, nor remove the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of them with what fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality: and instruct the weak one, to sleep on its back, or on its healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot abscess happens to it: then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess has subsided: and put on it what subsides it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed a crack occurs in the bone, or it becomes comminuted, extract.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of the fracture of the assistant.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The assistant is that which is from the elbow to the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to the shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are bound on the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from a raised place: and let the weak person sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should throw his broken arm over a stick, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which let the curved piece of wood be attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then let something heavy be suspended from above it, so that the assistant extends it to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician adjusts the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is, that the weak person rests on his neck: and his hand is suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, that one of them should hold what is above the fracture with their hands: and that the other should hold the lower part of it, and each of them should pull to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want it to be a stronger extension, then tie under the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two assistants pull to their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is adjusted according to what is necessary, and a good application is applied: then tie it, if not a warm abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If a warm abscess does occur, then loosen the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then tie it: and the method of tying it is, that you put a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a dressing made from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he should place his arm on the help itself and put his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put a cloth and tie it over the help for the arm, so that the arm stays in place: if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything altered by you from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something will be altered by you from the fractured bone, then use a splint: and it is, that you put on the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put between every splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie over the splints a bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture stretches, the less tight the bandage should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the splints and bandage as we have said at the hour when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a warm abscess, then remove the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage for all three days, so that there does not occur in the place itching, or inflammation, or is prevented by foods reaching the limb, because of the condition from the excess of the tightness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore straighten the whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the weak person sleep on their back and their hands on their stomach: and put under the arm a full cushion of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, that the shape of a fractured limb is not dissolved, nor the bandage loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Set it right therefore with all your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the invalid according to the order which we previously mentioned, so that it should be a subtle diet at first, until the mouth begins to close: then it is necessary that you increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the hip and the thigh, that it should be constricted for forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and medicine be applied with ointments which restore it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and contused, then you should not loosen the bandage from it, but keep it until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two little foemen.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger forearm bone alone breaks, or the smaller one: and perhaps they break together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper small forearm bone breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forearm bone breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones break together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that breaks is the upper small forearm bone, then it is suitable for the doctor at its restoration to apply a slight extension with ease, until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large forearm bone is the one that is broken: then it is necessary that a strong bandage be applied.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is suitable that he should put a figure of a hand near its restoration and its own extension extended on the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers above: and the joint should be lower than all the fingers or the rest: and let the weak one sit squared upon itself, and let the pillow be before it, or in a straight line with it, in height, so that the weak one does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend the arm from its lower part, or his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend it similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician adjusts the bone until he reduces it to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	What if there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then take care to reduce every fragment in its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed a separated splinter appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then sew over it, and remove it according to the method that we have spoken of concerning those things which were mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter about that, so take the treatment of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	What if at the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then spread a linen cloth made with rose oil and white wax, and let it be a medium between thickness and subtlety: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage, until when the abscess has settled: then remove the wax, and put an prepared plaster made from powdered flour with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put splints, and let the splint that is put on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one forearm or in two forearms at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your bandage over the place of the fracture, stronger and tighter, and somewhat more with the bandage towards the upper part of the fracture, or to the lower part of it: or put a softer bandage instead of it for a short while, according to what was stated in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be gentle cloths, moist: and not rough, harsh.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be a linen one, medium between subtle and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the bandage after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	What if something happens which needs correction, such as an itch that happens to the limb: then it is necessary, that you bathe the limb with warm water, until that itch calms down, and you release the limb not constricted, until it calms down, then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	What if the bandage has already been softened, and the wound has already closed, and similar things to these: then correct that entirely with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, on account of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary that you soften it for a while, and release it for some days, until nourishment runs to it, then tie it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however nothing happens to the weak person among those things which we have said, then it is not necessary that it be undone, unless after twenty days, or around that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the hand of the weak person be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be straight, and let it be protected by its strength from agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole of it is secondary to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture of the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless from repeated trauma.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture of the sole or a trauma occurs, then it is necessary that the weak one sits on a seat: and before him is a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant extends the fractured bones, and the physician adjusts them, until they join with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he put on a plaster and a dressing, if not a hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint over it according to the quantity of the place: and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is near the lower part of the heel of the foot, then make a sphere-like shape out of cloth: and order the weak person to press it with his foot that has the fracture: then it is tied with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot: and tie it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you put a splint over it, and another splint under it on the foot: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put a bandage, as the hand turns: and extend between the fingers with a binding.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	Which if a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, adjust according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie with the foot: and if you love him, put on a straight small splint, so that the fracture may be elevated, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be straightened, and bandaged with the healthy finger that follows it: or all should be bandaged according to continuity: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a small star on top of it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the appliance of a warm poultice: and apply with it what is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to which its treatment is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The neck of the hip is frequently fractured, and it is revealed by sensation: since it is converted to the inner and back part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in this way, that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And a plaster is applied over its surface.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every bandage is extended to its own part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the bandage be to the part of the chest, so that the extension falls upwards: and another bandage below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, so that the extension is to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician adjusts the bone with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur on the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days, until the warm abscess subsides, then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The narrowing of it should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you bind a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a binding: and fold it twice or thrice: and let some of it remain as an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the leg, until the heel reaches near the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee downwards, and let the ends of the thread appear from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap over the leg and hip what remains in excess of the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put over the hip, in the place of its fracture, a splint, and put one of them as a splint over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft rags, so that it equals the narrowing.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture, with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend it with a bandage from the place of the fracture, let your narrowing be less and softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then tie the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind therefore with three splints which are above, to both.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then bring the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie with them also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the bandage on for as long as it stays, so that there is no corrosion of the member, nor an abscess, nor inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Apply therefore its remedy, and correct the whole thing that happened from it, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a fragment of bone in the wound which pierces from the bone: then it is necessary that you reduce it equally, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above that and remove that, and treat with that which the aforementioned treatment has preceded, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides that pieces of bone are added to it, as we said regarding the help and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Truly however in the restoration of one fractured thus, does not occur in the weak a lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is, is always lame.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is reduced from it: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but an injury to it happens many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs to it, then it is not unless either a split or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And let it be that the whole is treated with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it aggregates and is joined according to what is possible from equality and ease and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster made from flour of sesamus, or of milled wheat, with the white of egg: and put above it a round piece of bone, if you desire it: and tighten over it a bandage suited to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated concerning other fractures: such as a hot application, and similar to that: so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a broken skull.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that the skull is made up of two bones, one of which is thick and is called by the name skull, and the other is subtle and is called foecile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both types of skull fractures what happens to the two bones of the arm, and because of that, its restoration is made, just like the restoration of the arm, equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	What if the two bones are broken together, the skull will be converted to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the subtle bone is broken, the skull converts to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you find it below, and it is one of those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Truly it is necessary, if the fracture of the skull is a foul fracture, having many sores: that there should be a lesser extension, and a gentler alleviation of yours.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the skull there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, when you equal the stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which are used in the making of wooden sandals, that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and not from the tiny ones: and let their length be according to the length of the skull from the knee down to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wraps according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the skull on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the bottom of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two splints in three places with two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the tightening is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and it stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let a little bed be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it conserves itself from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is very necessary, that you should do that in the fracture when there is a wound with it of its own.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and study it with utmost care for signs of an abscess, or inflammation, or other remaining things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything happens from those, then apply to it what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel indeed does not have a fracture within.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	A fracture happens to the bones of the foot and to the toes also a little, and it does not happen to them except by bruising in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	What if a fracture happens to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the weak foot be placed on the ground prepared, as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on what is elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or tread upon it: and make it equal, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put a plaster, and pack above: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot a suitable tightness, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three days, or four, have passed for it, then loosen the binding.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones equal, whether they are fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is in them, as you have seen.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put a splint on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it: then place under the foot this board which I have described to you, and bind it with a suitable binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then put on top of each finger a splint of its own size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the underside of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, that you do not forget, but consider all things which I have told you regarding the remainder of the fractures from accidents which we have spoken of: and oppose each accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Of the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the os pubis, and the virga of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her backwards a little to that side, and let it be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill the vulva of hers with a cake, until it fills it: and let it become in the vulva from that like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and her back be lifted up little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cake will come out, until it forms before the opening of the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she then wants to urinate, remove the cake with ease, then let her urinate: and reduce it itself according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be done for seven days, or thereabout, for the mouth itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you need, take a small reed tube and tie over the opening of it a thread of papyrus, and insert the whole tube into the vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the tube is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with a gauze, and let it stand for some days, according as we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the mouth of the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and its adjustment that which we have described for the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the rectum be hidden in these nearby fractures, which little touch, especially to him who has something of a stud or a peg.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book this much, that the fracture itself shows you in many treatments the right way for its restoration and its adjustment: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the rod of a man is broken, take the neck of a goose, and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put over it a dressing made of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabout, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of bone fractures, when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him to whom a fracture with a wound happens, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the like of it, that he should be bled at once: if the conditions of bleeding, as we have said before, testify to you.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	For if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary, that you should proceed to its cutting, so that you powder over it the powdered zeolite: if you have not present another thing.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day: and do not postpone it, unless an abscess forms.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess forms, then abandon the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad accidents to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary that you should gently reduce it and adjust it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it and its adjustment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight finger widths, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the quantity he needs for the cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round, and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double at the time of compression during the operation: and let it have a sharp end, which has a edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be thicker from the middle of it to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the pointed curved end of it be placed over the end of the protruding bone: and push it with it once, until the bone returns and is adjusted by some adjustment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore adjust the ends of the fracture to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the fractured end is delicate and does not receive the instrument with a good grip, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce the bone with what we have narrated altogether, then cut it with what is suitable for it from the incisions that we have mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then rub away what remains in the bone from roughness and small fragments.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the weak person finds after its reduction a vehement painful wound, then know that the bone did not return to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do it therefore.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer on the weak person a great benefit, when your restoration which you do for the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip a cloth in black astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not put on the wound a plaster, nor anything in which is oil, so that it does not cause to happen in it putrefaction and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the stars at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered: so that you cut with a fork a hole in the bandages according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you constrict the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many foolish physicians have done this: and have caused to happen to their weak patients either death, or corruption, or ichor, that is, sanies.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your dressing be soft, gentle, different from the dressings of fractures and other things.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad, or is a great wound, and you find on it certain evil accidents which we have narrated, and you find pain in the place suspended: then it is not suitable that you put on it a plaster.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages from hard cloths in the place of plasters, and constrict it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above the dressing that you had placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply bandages and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the ointment tetrapharmacon and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the dressing.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it becomes consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way, that the pus runs out from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass for the wound and it does not consolidate, nor is the pus separated from it: then know that there are small splinters of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Wherefore it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Whatever of those small splinters are separated, remove them, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and prick the member, and cause pain, try to cut around them, and remove them in every way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If there happens to the wound zuchen or ekileten, that is, estiomenus, or another species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose each one of them with what is suitable for it from the cure, whose description preceded in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which it is necessary for my speech to stand, and to which you should direct your attention when a bone fractures, and protrudes above the member, such as the hip bone, and the shoulder, and similar ones of the large members, it is that you should not attempt to pull it back, for many times death occurs from this, instead leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For it will surely fall out by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then take care of the wound, if it seems to you, and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the cure of swelling in the case of a fractured limb.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs in the healing of a fracture of the limb.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially one that is near the joints, and is disfigured from the shape of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then, if the swelling is recent, administer to it medicines which have a contracting property, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and gum, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, that you take some of these or all of them, and mix them with a drying wine, or with the whites of eggs, or with vinegar: and apply them to the swelling in a poultice, and bind them tightly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the binding on, nor loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a sheet of lead from Decenter.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing all that is inflamed from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is constricted, and necessity urgently demands its removal: then cut on its upper part, and incise the prominent excess: or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the cure when it is restored, and the limb remains after that subtle, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains after that subtle and weak, then this does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of them is the multitude of the solution of a bandage and its ligation not according to what is opportune: either because of the superfluity of the strictness of the bandages, until the nourishment is prohibited from running to the member: or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at not its hour: or because of the paucity of blood in the body of the infirm, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure of it is to feed the infirm, and to make tender its body, until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the member, so that it may attract much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And repeatedly moisten its bandage with warm water, until the nourishment runs and it returns to its natural figure.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Of the cure of fractured bones when they are restored to their twisted state.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member already restored after its healing becomes twisted and a bone that is fractured or knotted is prominent, and the form of the member is disfigured by it, nevertheless the member is not prohibited from its natural operation: then it is not necessary to heed the advice of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish doctors and restorers, who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed highly culpable, leading to death, or great fear, so that it would be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent: then it is necessary that a bandage be applied with warm water, in which there have been decocted softening herbs, such as leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and their like.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made for him a plaster with a softening plaster, such as diachylon prepared from the decoction.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Let a plaster of the root of marshmallow be applied, and let it be rubbed with hen's fat or with sesame oil: and let it be applied as a poultice.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Let the fat figs be pounded, and let them be ground with dove's dung, and let these and similar things which are named from medicines that lessen the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when a knot is loosened with continuous, gentle, and mild friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let the movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the deformity has already preceded, and has become strong, and is turned into a callus, and necessity has been provoked for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that the part above it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which exceeds in knot or bone be cut out with fine incisions: and let facilitation be administered to it with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On speech in the case of Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exiting of a joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	For which it is prohibited from its motion, and the figure of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pains to happen on the weak part, and vehement injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and let it not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes calloused, and perhaps with that the reduction of the dislocation is hindered.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	On account of this therefore it is not necessary that it be moved, nor extended at the time of its callous formation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes spasms to happen, and painful pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary that you proceed to the bleeding of the weak part.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be applied, until the aposteme quiets.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb should be treated with that which is recalled to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already discussed the chapters on dislocation and also according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Of the cure of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Both jaws are rarely dislocated except slightly.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both is done according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with slight movement, and made soft for a while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with complete dislocation, until they become soft to the part of the chest, until the saliva of the weak one runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is slight, then it returns in many cases by itself with swiftness.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed the dislocation is complete, entire: then it is necessary that the reduction of it be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is, that the assistant holds the head of the weak one: and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both his thumbs together, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of the fingers of his hands are outside, with which he pulls.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the weak one, that he cleans his jaws, and frees them for chewing on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician pulls the jaw, and thrusts the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	What if the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected at the same time: then administer vapor with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor should you delay the reduction of both entirely, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When the jaws return and are equal, and the weak mouth is closed, and not softened: then put over them cotton pads, with cerate made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the weak person should sleep on their back: and their head should be steady between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right or left: nor should they be forced, or compelled to chew anything: instead soft food should be put in their mouth, until when the pains have subsided, and the jaw is knotted: then they should eat what they want, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert himself over the operation of his mouth during eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is knotted and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	What if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult, when they become dislocated at some time, and do not return to their own place: then often fevers and constant thirst occur from it: and perhaps the belly of the weak person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then know that it is a loss, and often he dies to whom it happens in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the elbow, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is dislocated whenever to the outer sides: and that is shown by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, for the weak person to lie on their back, and to extend their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then grasp the constricted place with your palm, for the constriction itself will relax.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The limbs which follow the elbow and are connected with it are not dislocated except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	What is dislocated on that day should be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what has been prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put a plaster on it, and poultices, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to stillness and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the arm is reduced when it is separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is, that it is dislocated towards the lower part of the armpit.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it is dislocated towards the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder, and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, on account of the blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, on account of the nerve.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most often it is dislocated and protrudes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is sparse.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it protrudes quickly in them and goes in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely that it protrudes with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men a blow or a fall, and the shoulder becomes swollen with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of that, that it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary, therefore, that you should test that thing, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is recognized when it turns to the lower parts of the shoulder joint, and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find between them a clear difference, and you find in the head of the shoulder a concavity, and below the joint upon touching the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the shoulder is dislocated downwards or upwards, then you find a palpable feeling, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this kind of dislocation is easy, when it is recent, or the weak person is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that the assistant lifts his hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your thumbs under the joint and lift the joint with force upwards to its place: and the assistant lifts his hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he puts it downwards, for it returns quickly to its place.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by what we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the weak person should bathe in warm water, and an embrocation which softens and soothes should be administered, such as if the roots of marshmallow and fenugreek and melilot are decocted in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak person should rest on his back: and a sphere and wool which is equal between softness and tightness should be put under the joint.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and pull the weak person's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another servant should hold the head of the weak one, so that it is not moved to the lower parts: for he himself immediately returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you do, draw him back according to this method: and it is, that you make the strong man be present who is longer than the weak one, and stand at the side, and insert his shoulder under the armpit of the weak one: and lift up his armpit to the upper parts, until the weak one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another servant should pull the hand of the weak one to the lower parts of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the weak one is lightweight: then it is necessary, that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down: for dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is drawn back also according to another method: and it is, that a long wooden pole be fixed in the ground, whose head is of a round figure: such as a mason's mallet: which is neither thick nor subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let it be placed under the weak one after they have put soft cloths on top of the head of the wood: and let the weak one stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be stretched out to the lower part from the other side, and let his body be stretched out from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	What if the reduction of it is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, that you take a wooden pole whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance is alleviated into the depth of the armpit, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths should be tied over the round head, so that the wood does not harm the weak one.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the armpit of the weak one, so that the hand or arm is stretched out over the wood up to the lower parts: and let the wood be tied over the aid, and arm, and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed on the step of the ladder in width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is let down suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint will enter immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whatever mode is possible: then it is necessary, that you place under the eyelid a sphere of equal quantity made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put the prepared plaster made from the powder of millet with benzoin and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it turns out above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie under the eyelid a proper bandage: and turn the ligature over the plaster above: and attach his hand to his neck, and let it be, nor move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that food of little nourishment be given, until the member is strengthened: since it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is put on after seven days, or five, and it is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it becomes firm and is not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If indeed the joint is dislocated many times, on account of the humidity which happened to it, or on account of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be administered to it, according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter about cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all this is done, and the ligature is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and bandage are put on it many times, and it does not become firm, and falls, and cannot be lifted up to the upper parts: then know that the nerves which are at the head of the shoulder have already been cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	And dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast, or a reduction to the back, is done with an impulse and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the rest of the bandage and care are administered to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if after healing a heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement then let the weak one use a bath many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the cure of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it falls under sight and under touch, according to whichever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is shown to you clearly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is shortened, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch with it its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot aposteme occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot aposteme occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed at all, especially when it is to the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and a more vehement pain occurs to them: and many times death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is from those which are possible to reduce, is that the hand of it is extended with two hands: and its arm is stretched out, and the hands of the doctor are above the elbow and below it, and he himself pushes the joint with his thumbs or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he bends his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the dislocated elbow.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if not preceded dislocation to reduction, then administer violent extension, and it is that two assistants stretch the arm, and two assistants hold it also, so that it is not moved during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned to every part after which a double layer of cloth or a broad bandage is applied over the hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches with his hand the joint, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is one of those things which help with the slipperiness of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he pushes the joint with a vigorous push until it slips back.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it, in which there is astringency and excitation with the whites of eggs: and it should be bound with a decent bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the invalid, and left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is stabilized in its place, then undo the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being well bound, then apply another plaster, and bandage, and leave it for some days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then undo it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer a moistening in a bath, and subtle rubbing, and compression, until it is soothed, or put on the joint a plaster made of fat of the spleen.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it, and leave it on for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over it a mixture of vinegar one, and second, and third time with the bath, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you use it, put on top of it a poultice of dung, warm and heated with butter.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It is soothed by itself, and returns to its own condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of the dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The elbow of the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike the rest of the joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour in which it becomes dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed: or a hot abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is, that you put the elbow of the hand on a table, and an assistant extends the hand of it: and the physician puts his palm on the prominence of the joint, and presses it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that it be considered, if the palm has already receded to the front of the hand: then let the back of the hand be put on a table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation proceeds to the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be turned inward on a table, that is, the inner part of the hand be put on a table, so that the hand of the physician falls on the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a poultice sitting on the abscess: and leave it, nor repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you above the reduction of it, after the days have passed, however the joint remains according to its twistedness: and nothing harms the patient, except that the hand becomes soft, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut or injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is not therefore ingenuity in it, except that it is tightened with a cautery near its edge.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not press upon anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then put on top of it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be tightened and left for five days: afterwards let it be loosed and left, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however the motion of it is hindered, and some heaviness occurs in it: then let it be soothed with warm water, and rubbed several times, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the cure of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger to the back of the hand, or its joint: then extend the finger, and push back the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it, and extend it, until it becomes straight on its own on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it has been so, bind it according to the same method: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days, until it becomes tight.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do similarly with it, if it is dislocated towards the joint of the hand: and bind it to the same part, and perform your first operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the cure of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When there occurs to someone a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back, or of the neck, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death quickly follows the infirm.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the weak bowel comes out without control, and it cannot hold it, and often some of its members become softened because of it, or two of its legs, or two of its arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often a removal is made, because often a removal is made to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is removed towards the back is called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is that you should consider then, if the Gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to those, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of treatment in prolix discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	To whom it does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated from it, whose fault excuses little because of its abundance in my proximity to the intention: and my exposition which I expounded it, and formed an instrument for it in a different way than that which they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the humpbackedness which occurs from the front part, there is no ingenious remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which happens to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, except that which happens on the back properly, with what I relate: and it is, so that the weak one is extended on his face on a level platform near the wall: and under it a humid cloth is spread, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, near his head: and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform: and an assistant holds the stick, and it is not fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	One servant should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then tie above the head of the weak person, and under his armpits a soft ligature, firm, and extend the end of the ligature to the wood which is near his head, and tie it on that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another ligature above his ankles, and above his knees, and near his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligatures together, and tie them on another wood which is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each servant should pull the ligature to the part of the wood, and the two woods should not be moved from their places where they are fixed: nevertheless they should not be tightened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should put his palms on the vertebrae with force, until it returns, or he should put a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should attach his feet to the board, until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And bore in the wall which we mentioned that is near the weak person, a place into which the end of the board will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then put the middle of the board on the vertebrae.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician should put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should pull strongly, until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a lathe that is turned by your hand: and it is, as if you fix in the ground near the head of the weak person at the end of the bed two woods, whose length is one cubit: and near his head at the end of the bed two woods.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between each wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs: and each wood should be fixed firmly in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round stick is inserted: and it is turned in which the ligature revolves in the two holes of the two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, in which the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm with what revolves: and in two other sticks there is similarly one of them.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures that you have tightened on the chest with the turnstile that is at its head: and the ligatures that you have tightened on its shins with the turnstile that is at its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand at each turnstile, who twists his hand with the cloth, with which the turnstile revolves: and the physician adjusts the Spondile, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turnstile, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the Spondile has returned, and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary that you put on an exciting plaster with white of egg.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards put on top of the plaster a bar of wood, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length such a quantity as to cover the place of the gibbosity, and over the sound part of the Spondile.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be tied with the ligature that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak person use subtle nourishment, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	Which if something of the swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the bar that we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let it be applied on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when a swelling occurs on the posterior Spondile of the back: and it is thought that it is due to a dislocation, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	It is not suitable that a presumption be made for him with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the cure of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not suffer anything except dislocation, nor does what happens to other joints due to slight movement and concavity happen to them.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of the ankle is dislocated in four ways.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it dislocates to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most often it dislocates inward, and little dislocation occurs to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inward is: that when you join the weak leg to the healthy one, it is longer: and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot fold its foot at the groin: and the place which follows the groin is affected with a warm poultice, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation to the outside occurs is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation to the front occurs is that it stretches out the healthy leg in extension: however it does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step forward: and its urine is retained, and its groin is affected, and upon walking it steps on its heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one to whom a dislocation to the back occurs is that it does not stretch the knee, nor can it bend before the groin is bent: and its leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation of species is that you should consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already become established with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is not in it a cure at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Not therefore ought a complete presumption be made for it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case in which the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four species of dislocations: then proper for this, that you bind the joint, and extend it to the interior and to the exterior, and move it right and left: perhaps indeed it returns, and does not need another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister, and let him extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a ligature, which will be tied above his leg above the knee: and another minister extends his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then let him tie with a gentle ligature over the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the region of the armpit, or from the back to the region of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension be of all of them in place of one, until the weak one is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this indeed is a common species of extension among the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every species that which I will say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it, indeed, when the dislocation is to the interior, it is necessary that the weak one lies on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let a ligature be placed over the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligature upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the region of the armpit.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then the assistant should take his strong arms and cut the thick place of the weak hip, and stretch it to the outer stretching of the vein.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If it does not obey you for entry with this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary that the two weak feet be bound together with a strong and gentle binding over the two heels and over the two knees: and let the length of each be from its fellow the quantity of four fingers: and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be hung over the head of the wooden beam, which is in the house: and its length from the ground should be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let another youth be hung with the weak one: and let another youth push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of it itself, however, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one should lie on a platform, according to what we have described for one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be tied over its weak leg itself, and over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden beams should be placed, one at its feet and the other at its head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then an additional wooden beam should be placed in the middle of the platform, fixed well: on which let wet cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the weak one: and let the beam be between its hips, so that it is not drawn to the lower parts at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant should stretch to his own part, and the physician should accomplish the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If it is cut to restore it, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put on it a plate, and press on it, as we have said for hunchbackedness, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	It is fitting that the weak one should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is fitting that the weak leg should be extended quickly: and this is a second narration on the couch: and the physician puts the palm of his right hand on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he tightens it with his other hand, and with that tightening he puts it extended downwards towards the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back, then it is not fitting that the weak one should be extended downwards, and it should be elevated above the ground: but rather it is fitting that it should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also fitting if his hip dislocates outwardly, according to what we said about its lying on two hips: and it is on its face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said just now.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is fitting that compression should be administered with a plate also on the place from which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed according to what is fitting.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you should extend the two weak legs: and when you see them equal, and the weak one draws in his leg, and expands it without effort: then you should know that the limb has already returned according to what is fitting: then join the two hips, and put on a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a wheel: so that the hip may not move to any part: and let the weak one adhere to quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then undo the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then you should know that the dislocation has already been fixed: therefore release the weak one to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something of softening: then reduce it, and apply a plaster to it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then undo it and make it stay behind in walking on both for some days, until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, namely to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will find the weak one applying his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is that you make the weak one sit upright, so that now he extends his leg if he can over it, and you adhere your back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them out between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the hip gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then undo it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the weak one does not use walking for some days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however the reduction of it fails you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description preceded in the cure of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes moved with a slight movement and sometimes it is dislocated according to its complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs, either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding to the side towards which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is an easy reduction, and it is that it should be extended with ease by the hands, and straightened until it returns to place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated according to its complement, it is necessary that you make the weak person sit upright and a strong assistant should hold him firmly from behind on the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should hold with your right hand his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand with two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch it with the left hand, and push the foot's heel upwards with the right hand towards the leg without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the heel of the foot towards the leg for the third time, and you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns to its place at the first or second attempt according to this method, and you see the foot is straight, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it, since it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have described: then make the weak person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a strong stick in the earth firmly, so that it falls between his thighs: and you have already wrapped something around it, so that it does not harm the weak person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the servant should take his thigh: afterwards the servant should stretch the other foot, either with his hands or with a bandage that binds above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the servant should stretch everything in the opposite direction of his comparison: and a small stick should stand between the two hips of the weak person holding it, so that his body is not pulled downwards at the lower part during stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns, and the health of its return is declared to you: then put a plaster and a dressing, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or avoid the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not oppressive over them and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage becomes loose, bind it: then undo it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the weak person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he tries to walk before that time, there will not be security unless the dislocation is dissolved over it, and becomes putrid, and it does not receive a cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	What if a hot abscess occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer to its treatment what we previously mentioned in another place concerning the cure, and an application of warm poultices, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Of the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated among them should be adjusted with a little extension without labor: and this indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the foot's back: then it is necessary that the weak make his foot sit on an equal place to the ground, or on a board: and he stands as one walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then tread on it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it already equal, and it does not appear in the place of prominence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the sole of his foot a board that can hold the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a binding for three days sufficiently.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then unbind it, and make it rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Of the species of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to it, and you consider its cure and restoration, many times death occurs: and because of that, it is not necessary that one presumes on the cure of such a thing, unless one who is prudent in the art from long usage, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor presumptuous: and so that he uses medicines which calm hot apostems only: and entrusts the weak to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for health from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and in which appears something to be hoped.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, consider the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the thing, before a hot apostem happens.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If the member returns according to what you wanted, then administer a regime that calms an apostem: and cure the wound with what is suitable for it from dried plasters.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	Which if the dislocation is with a fracture, and they happen in a separated bone, then consider their removal, and do on it what we said in simple sicknesses from that which preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance on the way of fear: according to that which my preceding preaching has instructed you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more healthy for your body among them in your time.
