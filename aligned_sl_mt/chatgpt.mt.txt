O, sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, through its completion reaching its end, and through its expositions and its explanations, it seems to me that I should complement it for you with this treatise, which is about the operation by hand, that is, surgery.
Because the operation by hand is laid low in our region and in our time, completely deprived, until the science of it is greatly endangered, and the trace of it is removed; and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which mostly changed and turned into errors and doubts, so that their understandings are closed and the strength and art of it is extended away.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the organization of this treatise in that way through exposition and explanation and abbreviation; and so that it comes with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work as well as with the addition of explanation, and with preparation of it, which is necessary.
But the reason why no good practitioner is found with his hand in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and it requires its practitioner first to be trained in the science of anatomy, which Gualia recounted, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs and their forms, and their joining and separation; and has knowledge of the bones, the nerves and the muscles, and their number, and their exit points; and of the pulsating veins and the still veins, and the locations of their origin.
And therefore, Hippocrates says that with one name it is great, but in practice small, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book; for he who is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, by which men will die, as I have seen too many of those, for some are trained in this science and throw themselves into it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who had incised a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries of the neck so that much blood flowed and the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large, and he came to it and removed that stone with a piece of the bladder, for which that man died on the third day.
And I was already called to remove it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I recognized he would die from it.
And I saw another doctor who took a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and came upon a black eunuch who had a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor, with his ignorance, set the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with tight bandaging, and did not leave any breathing room for the wound.
And after some days he loosened it according to his wishes, and rebandaged it, and left it for some days and commanded that the binding not be loosened; and so it remained until the thigh and foot were abscessed and reached destruction.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the binding, and he achieved calm and thus relieved his pains.
But however, the corruption was already established in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for some days, until its malignancy was increased by its master (host).
The reason being that the cancerous ulcer is full of melancholic humor, thus it should not be completely removed by iron (surgery), but should be in a limb that can completely tolerate being removed.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two parts: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is work with which there is danger in the major conditions.
And I have already mentioned this in every part of this book where there is an operation in which there is error and fear; so it is necessary for you to observe this and leave that, so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
And so take your tools with diligence and with the protection of God, and your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best way by the grace of God leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and put away your tools from what makes you fear, so that doubt in your faith and in your name does not evade you: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and ultimately for your sanctity.
Gualia has already said in some of his admonitions: "Do not treat bad diseases, so that you are not called bad doctors."
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter arranged from head to foot, in the forms of the instruments and the tools of the cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, and on cupping, and on wounds, and on extracting arrows and similar things, all categorized and arranged by the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the healing of twists and similar things; a chapter arranged from head to foot, and on the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary for me to speak about the qualities of the benefits of that cauterization and its harms, and in which constitution cauterization is prohibited.
Thus I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefits of cauterization and its harms is a long and detailed discussion, subtle through science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed on it, and for me, a small portion of their discourses suffices, fearing prolongation.
Therefore I say that cauterization benefits any constitution universally which has or lacks matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter they disagreed; for some said that cauterization is beneficial for it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which is by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable for a hot and dry illness to be healed by something that is hot and dry.
And he who said the opposite of that said that by cauterization benefit is made in any hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its moistures to the constitution of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say through the discourse of that one, that I have already discovered this in some experiments.
However, it is not appropriate for someone who is not already experienced and practiced in the chapter of cauterization through thorough exercise to come upon this, and who has not known the diversity of the constitutions of men and the disposition of the diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the time span of those.
But in the other constitutions, there is no fear for you, especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all the doctors have agreed on those, and have not disagreed on the benefit of cauterization in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cauterization with fire and its goodness, as opposed to cauterization with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other member adjacent to it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches that in the members which are distant from it, and very quickly brings to the member a disease of difficult healing and very quickly seen.
But the fire, due to its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except to remove excess. And it is already known to us by experiment and by long service of study in the art on the truth of the causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of the discourse. And if it were not that it is not read in my book, in this I would pause to you a hidden secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and of its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be quickened in your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is suitable to do cauterization and they place the best time in spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, because the harm from the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for pains or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not suffer delay because it is feared that from those will come a malignancy, which is greater than the small harm entering from the time.
And this does not fall into your minds, oh sons, this is not thought by anyone except the common people and foolish doctors, that is, that the disease healed by cauterization does not recur all the time, and they place that as a result.
And the cause is not as they think because of this, because cauterization is only in place of medicine which alters the constitution and dries the moistures which are the cause for the pains to come.
But cauterization surpasses medicine by the swiftness of its power and virtue of its operation and the greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that the disease will return at some hour of the time, according to the constitution of the patient and the location of his disease, and the strength of it, and that which is prepared in his body from the accumulation of excesses in it, and that which has come to it in his acquisition of foods and similar causes; unless the disease in which cauterization is administered is a subtle disease in a member with few excesses and moistures, like the cauterization of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that in it that pain will not return, but this happens rarely.
And the common saying is that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a true saying, not for what they understand in it, because they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine nor with another cause except cauterization.
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine is not except when we administer the methods of healing in some diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and near the end of the cause one administers cauterization, and it benefits that. And then from here it falls that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and the many foolish doctors understand.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauterization does not become rough, though this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested this and found that it does not do this except in some bodies and not in others, and cauterization with it is good and better than with iron as they said; but however, when you make cauterization with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want due to the toughness of the gold, and because it is prepared to receive cold; and if you apply ignition on it, the gold melts by the fire, and some layers fall into the fire, by which the artificer falls due to the occupation with it.
And therefore cauterization with iron is done by us more easily and more suitably to the correctness of the operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have arranged them from the head to the feet, so that I might alleviate the demand by giving what is needed.
The first chapter.
This cauterization helps with humidity and coldness on the brain, which are due to two causes, namely soda and the abundance of rheumatic flow called catarrh, from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and pain of the teeth and throat, and generally any disease that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden stroke, and similar diseases.
The method of this cauterization is this: firstly, you command the patient to evacuate the head with purgative medicine, cleaning it for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and habits.
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit between your hands on a square bench and place his hands on his chest.
Then place the edge of your palm near the well above the bridge of the nose between his eyes. However, when the middle of your finger locates the spot, mark that place with a probe, and then ignite the olive cautery iron, the form of which is:
And then place it on the marked spot with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with your hand gradually applying pressure, and you rotate it.
Then lightly lift your hand and check the spot, and if you see any part of the bone exposed, as much as a grain of wheat, then lift your hand, and if not, return with the iron or another iron, if it has cooled, until the bone is visible as I have told you.
Then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then place cotton soaked in vinegar over it and leave it until the scab from the burn is destroyed. Then treat the spot with tetraderm ointment until it is healed.
And some have said that as long as the wound remains open, it expels the humor better, making it more beneficial.
And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's surface is burnt.
Then scrape off the burnt part of the bone and treat it.
Others have said that with the cautery, it should reach the marrow, pressing strongly on the bone until it falls, and this is the form of the minor alphecati: And they believe that from that spot the vapors of the head are expelled.
The wound should be kept open for a long time, and then be treated until it is consolidated.
But to me, these two kinds of cauterization have not been seen at all, except in some men as a means of precaution; and leave that, in my view, it is better for health, as it is; because the head is weakened by the breaking of its continuity as we have testified in other members, especially when the patient's head is of fragile nature.
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my view; use that one and work with that for health.
Second chapter.
Of the cauterization of the head.
When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain and this has been prolonged in the patient, and he uses warm packs, cupping, head purges, poultices, ointments, suppositories, chickens, and the like, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of those causes provide relief, then consider if the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature; and it is not fragile and has found great coldness, then cauterize with another cautery a little below that. Then cauterize that on the horn of his head with a cautery until the skin is split. Incise the skin and expose the amount of bone which we have recounted and cauterize it with a cautery on the back part of the head in the place called "vas" — and it is that place where cupping is done. And ease your hand in that, and do not expose the bone, because the patient finds much greater pain from that than from any other head cautery.
And I will tell this cautery in its place, because the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Third chapter.
Of the cauterization of recent migraine.
When sudden pain arises in the part of the head, or pain is extended into the eye, evacuate the head with cleansing medicines, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases; and if all that does not help, then cauterization in that place is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with iron.
But cauterization with burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off the ends of both heads. Then incise the spot of the pain in the temple with a broad lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then press on it with a stopper for gradual constriction, and leave it for three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then place cotton soaked in vinegar over it until the spot makes a scab.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise of burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: ignite the cautery iron of which this is the form:
It is called "clavis clavis", because its head is like the shape of a nail in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Then place it on the spot of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the artery beneath it is not burnt — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burnt is approximately half the thickness of the skin, lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burnt, so that no blood flow comes.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in vinegar, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the surgical knife according to the cautery, and beware of incision of the artery in this recent migraine.
Chapter Four:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Migraine
When you treat chronic migraine with the remedies we have previously described and those outlined in the sections on diseases, and if the treatment does not work, and you see that it is necessary to go beyond what was described in the initial cautery with medicine or cautery with fire, then you must ignite the cautery iron until it is white-hot. Mark the spot of the pain with a line about half the length of a finger, or nearly so; place your hand firmly once and press it until you cut through the skin and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary to avoid the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, and to ensure that the muscle is not burned and the nerve that controls it is not damaged, to prevent spasms.
And it is crucial to be cautious about the blood flow from the artery that may be cut, as there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who are inexperienced and not diligent or trained; leave the operation at that initial stage.
I will come back with a reminder about the management of accidental bleeding from the artery in its proper place in this book.
And if you see that this disease is not addressed by this cautery and the patient's body is strong enough, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, use the cautery method mentioned in the chapter on arterial constriction with a cautery with two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter Five:
On the Cauterization of Ear Pain
When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxative measures and other treatments described in the section, and the pain persists, then ignite the cautery iron, which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:
Then mark close to the ignition, and move it around the entire ear as if revolving a wheel, or in the circuit of each segment if the pain is in each one. Extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after marking the spot with a probe.
If the cautery has ten points in the entire ear, or nearly so, treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter Six:
On the Cauterization of Torticollis
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only of the types caused by phlegm, as we have said in the sections on diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or from nerve spasm.
When you treat that type of torticollis with cups, head purges, and other treatments, and it does not improve, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third near the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery iron at the right of the uppermost part of the ear, a little above the horn of the head, and at the temple on the other side, the length of which is about the length of a thumb, and apply your hand with the cautery iron until it burns about half the thickness of the skin.
This is the form of the cautery iron, and it is a type of surgical knife, the form of which is set out beforehand. However, it is more subtle when it is slightly like this; and the knife should be slightly thicker than usual.
Then treat the spot with the remedy mentioned earlier until it is healed.
Chapter Seven:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Apoplexy
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with the remedies we have mentioned and the medication does not help and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the horns of the head; with a cautery iron in the middle of the head as we have described; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. The method of cauterization is done as previously described.
And it is also cauterized on the pit of the stomach; and this is more posterior; then treat with what has been previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight:
On the Cauterization of Memory Loss Caused by Phlegm
At the beginning, the patient should be given large jars and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then shave the patient's entire head and place a cedar plaster on the nape of the neck, as described in the treatise on plasters.
Apply it several times, as it acts in a similar manner to cauterization. Do this according to the same order already described.
If the patient is healed by these methods, that is good; if not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, descending from the uppermost part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. Place the cauteries about a finger's width apart, and treat them with the previously mentioned remedies.
But if you want to add more and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if you want to add even more, then cauterize over the two horns.
Then treat the area until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
Chapter Nine:
On the Cauterization of Paralysis and the Softening of the Entire Body
You should proceed with cleansing the head with jars and the remedies we have mentioned; then shave the patient's head, and cauterize with a cautery iron in the middle of the head, on all the horns of the head, on the nape of the neck, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
If necessary, in the case of softening of the body, if the disease is severe and the patient can tolerate it, then make four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally cauterize until the skin is deeply burned, and then lift your hand. Then treat the area until it is healed, and this should be an olive-shaped cautery.
Chapter Ten:
On the Cauterization of Epilepsy.
Epileptics are not to be cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Initially, you should cleanse their brain with cups and other treatments mentioned in the division if the patient is an adult and can tolerate the use of medicines.
If it is a child who cannot endure the medicines, administer fumigations and chewing substances that cleanse the brain for several days before the procedure, combined with suitable food.
Then shave the patient's head and cauterize the middle of the head following the previously described method, and another cautery on the back of the head, and on each horn of the head. If the patient is strong and can endure it, cauterize them as described for paralysis and softening of the body, on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.
Use olive cautery as described before.
But if the patient is a child, use a subtler cautery.
Chapter Eleven:
On the Cauterization of Melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, cauterize the patient with the same cauteries mentioned for paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is moist, give them something to cleanse their brain as previously mentioned in the division.
Then shave the patient's head and apply a suitably made turban soaked in old sheep’s butter.
The patient should sit upright and be held from all sides.
Then apply liniment; old sheep’s butter is preferable. Heat it over the fire to a moderate temperature that the patient can tolerate. Pour this onto the middle of the head within the turban and let it cool.
Do this once a week with other suitable regimens until cured. Or, if preferred, cauterize the patient with small points in the same manner, ensuring you hold the cautery appropriately. This type of cautery moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve:
On the Cauterization for Water Falling into the Eye.
When the onset of water in the eye is identified by the signs mentioned in the division, begin by giving the patient something to cleanse their head and avoid all humid substances.
Make them sweat in a steam bath for several days.
Then shave their head and cauterize the middle of the head. Additionally, cauterize the two temples if water is affecting both eyes, or one side if only one eye is affected.
Incise with the cautery all veins and arteries beneath the skin. The cauteries should be long and lateral on the temples.
Be careful to prevent bleeding when cauterizing; if bleeding occurs, stop it with any possible medicine.
I will provide further guidance on the extraction and excision of arteries and controlling bleeding.
Sometimes, cauterization is done on the neck below the two bones with two subsequent cauteries.
Chapter Thirteen:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Tearing.
When chronic tearing of the eyes is due to manifest veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, indicating cold phlegmatic excesses, cauterize the patient with the same cautery mentioned for the onset of water falling into the eyes, and a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the neck below the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. If additional cautery is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye’s tail at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen:
On the Cauterization of Nasal Fetor.
When treatment for nasal fetor as previously mentioned in the division proves ineffective, prepare and administer purgative pills for three nights. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize with an olive-shaped cautery. Next, cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery on both eyebrows just below the hairline.
Be careful not to incise the artery.
The form of the nail-shaped cautery is as described.
Chapter Fifteen:
On the Cauterization of Softening of the Eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by disease or humidity, cauterize the eyelid with a lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its form:
And if you wish, cauterize both eyebrows slightly with two cauteries in all parts, and they should extend from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the size of the eyebrow.
Do not press too hard with the cautery, but just enough so that a third of the eyelid is affected.
Chapter Sixteen:
On the Cauterization of the Eyelid When Hairs Grow Inward and Hurt the Eye.
When the hairs of the eye grow inward and hurt the eye, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with fire or with a caustic medicine.
If using fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let their hairs grow long and straight; and if it hurts them at the root, bind their eyes with a bandage so that they are not hurt until the hairs have grown.
When the hairs have grown long and straight, place the patient's head on your knee, and mark the eyelid with a marking rod in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the hairs.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Then cauterize over the marked figure bit by bit, many times, until the surface of the skin, marked like a myrtle leaf, is properly burned.
A sign of the success of your work is when you see the eyelid is contracted and the hairs are elevated away from the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply cotton soaked in butter until the scab is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the condition returns due to the hairs at their root and the eyelid is softened, cauterize it again as you did the first time.
If the hairs are on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and straightened so that the hairs do not hurt the eye.
The cauterization with caustic medicine involves instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and straight, then preparing a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take known soap and an ounce of quicklime, mix them well, and do this quickly so it does not cool. Then spread the mixture on the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyes; place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and position the patient's head on your knee.
Press the medicine slightly, but do not move it until the patient feels a biting sensation from the medicine, as if it were fire.
When the patient feels the biting sensation, remove the medicine and rub the area with your finger; when the sensation stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then see if the eyelid is already raised as it would be by fire or incision, and if not, apply the medicine again on the area where it was not effective, until the operation is complete and the eye is contracted.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn scab is removed, and treat it with ointment until healed.
You must be vigilant that no medicine falls into the eye during the operation, and if the eyelid softens again and the hairs cause pain, repeat the medicine on the softened area of the eyelid as you did initially, and treat it until it is healed.
This is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Know that human eyes vary in size, so your treatment should be adjusted accordingly.
The proper method will not be hidden from anyone who studies this art.
Chapter Seventeen:
On the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.
When treating a fistula according to the previous divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, it is necessary to cauterize in the following manner: instruct the patient to rest their head on your knee, and have an assistant hold the patient's head steady so it does not move or shake.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the patient's eye.
Next, heat the cautery,
which should be concave in shape, similar to a reed or vulture's feather, with one end suitable for the cautery.
If desired, it can be penetrating to the other end. And if you prefer, it can be a rod shape.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, extract the pus, and dry it. If it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.
Then place the well-heated cautery on the fistula, holding it from the eye to the nose to avoid errors or disturbing the patient, and apply the cautery to the tissue to cauterize it.
If the initial cauterization reaches the bone, that is good; if not, repeat the cauterization once or twice if necessary; then leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter and cover it with a drying ointment until healed.
But if after ten days it is not healed, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and treat it as described in the appropriate chapter.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula as suggested by some early practitioners is: locate the fistula and place a fine wick in it. Then pour a small amount (one ounce) of melted lead into the fissure; hold your hand steady with the wick to ensure the molten lead does not reach the patient's eye. Place cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye, as the lead will cauterize the fistula and heal it miraculously.
If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, that is good; if not, it is necessary to create a nasal passage and redirect the fistula to the nasal cavity as described in its appropriate section.
Chapter Eighteen:
On the Cauterization of Fissures in the Lips.
Fissures often occur in the lips, especially in children's lips.
When you treat these fissures as described in the divisions and your treatment does not succeed, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery as follows:
The concavity of the cautery should match the fineness of a knife.
Carefully place the heated cautery in the fissures until it reaches the base of the fissures.
Then treat it with plaster until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen:
On the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Mouth.
When an abscess forms in the root of the uvula, palate, or tooth roots, and it breaks and becomes chronic, forming a fistula, and your treatment is ineffective, it is necessary to use a cautery. Heat the cautery to fit the fistula and insert it into the fistula, holding it until the hot iron reaches the base; repeat this once or twice if needed, and then treat it as previously described until it heals.
If the pus is removed and it heals, that is good; if not, it is necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed bone as described in the relevant chapter.
Chapter Twenty:
On the Cauterization of Teeth and Softening of the Gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and treatment with medicine does not help, rest the patient's head on your knee, and heat the cautery. The form of the cautery should be such that you place the cannula over the tooth and insert the heated cautery quickly, holding it until the patient feels the heat reach the root of the tooth.
Then remove your hand and repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.
Then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This will firm the loose tooth, tighten the softened gums, and dry out the moisture.
Chapter Twenty-One:
On the Cauterization for Tooth Pain.
When tooth pain is caused by cold, frost, or worms, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, cauterization can be done in two ways: with cow's butter or with fire.
Cauterization with butter involves boiling cow's butter in an iron ladle, wrapping cotton around the end of a stick, dipping it in the boiled butter, and quickly placing it on the painful tooth until it cools.
Repeat this several times until the heat penetrates the root of the tooth.
If you prefer, soak wool or cotton in the butter, place it on the painful tooth, and apply a hot iron on top until the heat reaches the base of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire involves using a brass or iron cannula with some thickness to ensure the heat does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, apply it to the tooth, and hold it until it cools; repeat this a few times as needed to relieve the pain, either the same day or the next day.
The patient should fill their mouth with good butter, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This is the form of the cautery.
Use whichever extremity you find most suitable for cauterization.
This is the form of the cannula:
Chapter Twenty-Two:
On the Cauterization of Extrophulos.
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, and you want to digest them quickly, heat the concave cautery, which should have two open ends for smoke to escape. Apply the heated cautery to the abscess once, or as needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt tissue is removed.
Then treat it with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three:
On the Cauterization for Hoarseness of Voice and Constriction of the Windpipe.
When moisture accumulates in the windpipe, especially when it is due to a cold constitution, the patient should initially be treated with laxative medicines. Then cauterize the area near the root of the throat at the depressed location.
Take care not to let the cautery reach the throat or burn the tissue excessively, but only a little.
Then cauterize the area at the junction of the neck near the last vertebra. The cautery should be nail-shaped as previously described.
Treat the area with the previously mentioned methods until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Four:
On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity and the patient has no fever or tuberculosis and it is an old illness, then cauterize them with two cauteries on the furcula (collarbone) in the depressed places, lion-like and bulbous; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a pointed type according to the previous form.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be point-like with the cautery called puncta, the form of which is described earlier in the section on ear pain.
And let there be points among them; and then treat them with the same method as before until healed.
And if the cautery has three branches for the cauterization: in one session, you can make three cauteries in this form:
Chapter Twenty-Five:
On the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the shoulder.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to slippery humidity and it is not fixed at the time of its return to its usual position, and with a small movement it dislocates again, as we have observed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be laid on their back or on their healthy side; and then raise the tendon that is in the inner part of the shoulder to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then heat the cautery with two heads; and this is the form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then have four heads of the cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this calculation and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place cooked salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest in tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then cauterize on the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter Twenty-Six:
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and much humidity come to the stomach, causing it to deviate from its usual condition and this leads to a thickening of the tissues, and if you continue the usual treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize with three cauteries: one below the chest the width of a finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of the first cautery, forming a triangular shape; and space them so they are not too close together to avoid causing putrefaction.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the tendon.
And let the figure of the cautery be in this form without addition. If you prefer, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and let this be a circular cautery in this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized with pointed cautery for those afraid of this cautery: mark points on the stomach according to the amount needed, and then cauterize with the pointed cautery; and then treat it with the previously described method until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Seven:
On the cauterization of a cold liver.
When there is pain in the liver due to coldness or humidity or large amounts of gas, causing it to deviate from its normal state due to the expulsion of excesses, and the patient is not cured with the previously mentioned treatments, then the patient should lie on their back, and mark three cauteries in this form and this same amount on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human decubitus is.
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be along the length of the body straight.
And do not compress the area too much with the cautery.
And if the amount that is burned is the size of half the thickness of the tendon, and it should not be too tight; and if the patient is standing, then let them stand on their feet; if they are not standing, then they should lie down, with their legs extended and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery if you have the skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the whole thickness of the tendon be burned so that the entire body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the tendon here is delicate; and know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight:
On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When an abscess forms in the liver and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the covering of the liver, the pain is sharp and sometimes the doctors are already exhausted by treating it.
So the patient should be turned onto their back; then mark the place of the abscess with ink; and then heat the cautery which is shaped like a needle, the form of which was described on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire tendon is burned, until it reaches the covering, so that pus may escape.
And then treat it as with other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not suitable to use this form of cautery except by someone whose study in the art of medicine is advanced and who has treated many illnesses; this operation should only be attempted by experienced practitioners, but it is best to leave it to us.
Chapter Twenty-Nine:
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that the cautery made from the roots of aristologia for cold pleurisy is done in this way: take a long dry root of aristologia that is found and is the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place between the continuation of the furcula (collarbone) and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicles, slightly inclined to the area below the chin, and with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back; and one cautery in the place between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary to press too much with the cautery, but it should be evident in the tendon during the procedure.
Some ancients also said that some people use a cautery of iron similar to a rod and heat it, placing it in the location between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and pus is expelled, as we have said for the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with cautery, there is no fear, because one can die immediately or it can cause a fistula that cannot be healed.
Chapter Thirty:
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen using the method we have mentioned in the previous section and your treatment does not work, then cauterize it in one of three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to make three or four linear cauterizations along the length of the spleen, similar to the cauterizations for the liver, as previously described.
There should be a space the width of a finger or a little more between each cauterization, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as described for the liver.
Do not press too hard with the cautery; the patient should lie on their back.
Another method of cauterization is to heat a cautery with two edges, as mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and lift the tendon located in the area of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.
And your lifting should be along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made along the width of the body.
Then insert the two heated edges into the area to penetrate the tendon from the other side.
Then remove the cautery; now four cauterizations are made.
If you prefer, cauterize with a cautery that has three edges.
Then treat the cauterization wound until it stops discharging pus after a few days, as this is more effective than previous treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One:
On the cauterization of dropsy.
Cauterization is not normally used for dropsy except in specific cases.
When treating dropsy using the methods described previously, if your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the chest, and one more on the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the tendon.
Then leave the cauterized area open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
Do not stop the patient's treatment after cauterization until it is clear that the two intended purposes are achieved, which will hasten their recovery.
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be like a nail, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be like an olive, as described before.
Chapter Thirty-Two:
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the feet on the top between the little toe and the ring toe, lift your hand with the cautery without twisting it; then lift your hand and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will discharge.
The cauterization is done in this way: make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh, the cauterization should be done with the tip of the knife-shaped cautery. The cauterizations should be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and make two cauterizations on each thigh.
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some of the water can discharge from it.
Then treat it with the remedies we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three:
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is affected by cold and humidity, weakening the digestive and retentive functions of the stomach and intestines, and it is treated using conventional methods without success, sometimes the patient may require cauterization for beneficial results. Then cauterize with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described for stomach cauterization, with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauterizations around the navel, using a thin nail-like cautery; and cauterize on the prominent part with one large cautery, or two cauterizations.
If the excess humidity persists and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the lower abdomen and intestines, adding two more cauterizations on the stomach and near the groin, as this treatment is highly effective.
Chapter Thirty-Four:
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are present, or there are thick, cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated as previously described without success, then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower vertebrae of the small triangular back, and one cauterization above the navel, two finger-widths apart.
If you suspect that the patient's stomach is cold and the food is not digested, and their face appears swollen, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; also cauterize once on the liver, and once on the spleen with a nail-like cautery, leaving the cauterized area open for a while, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-Five:
On the cauterization of atheyl near their removal.
When you remove atheyl, heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the removed atheyl, moving your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, because if there are many atheyl, then cauterize each one as described, and then treat them with the appropriate ointments until they are healed.
If you cauterize with a large cautery on the prominent part, it is more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six:
On the cauterization of fistulas that form naturally in certain parts.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described, and the patient is frightened by it, they should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when a person has a fistula in a natural area, and it is old, oozing pus and corrupted humidities, the best approach is to probe it with a thin probe, and then measure the depth of it with the same probe.
Then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula, according to the depth measured by the probe.
Repeat the cauterization on it until the corrupted tissues are burned away, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
Be careful not to burn nerves or veins; if the fistula reaches the bladder or intestines, avoid those areas; only perform this procedure when the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not deep.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
If the area is sealed and the material has been removed, and it remains this way for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
If the materials are not removed, then know that it is deep or in the cavity of corrupted bone, or due to other causes that will be mentioned in their place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven:
On the cauterization of abscesses.
When abscesses cause pain due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's suffering is worsened, then you should cauterize the abscesses with a nail-like cautery, as previously mentioned.
Then quickly cauterize them a little below, resulting in three lined-up cauterizations, which will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight:
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder becomes weak and softened due to cold and humidity, causing the patient to be unable to hold their urine, then cauterize the lower part of the bladder, where the pubic hair starts, with one cauterization on the right side and another on the left side.
The length of each cauterization should be the size of the joints of the fingers; also cauterize the lowest part of the back, or with two cauterizations if necessary.
The cautery should be nail-like, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-Nine:
On the cauterization of the uterus.
When cold and humidity affect the uterus, preventing conception and corrupting menstrual flow, causing delayed onset and painful menstruation, then cauterize the area with three cauterizations around the navel as described for the bladder; and also cauterize the lower back with one or two nail-like cauterizations.
Chapter Forty:
On the cauterization of hip dislocation.
When mucous-like humidity is deposited in the hip area, causing dislocation, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found in the hollow area.
Then you should cauterize the patient on the hip area with a circular cauterization, after marking with a probe around the affected part so that the area falls in the middle of the circle.
The cautery should have the same form as described in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three large olive-like cauterizations.
The cauterization should be done to the depth of the entire scab; and then treat the area until it heals.
Chapter Forty-One:
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the hip area due to cold and humidity, and the patient is not cured by previous treatments, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with fetid pills or similar remedies; and then cauterize.
The method of cauterization can be of two types: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods, one of which involves cauterizing the hip area with three triangular cauterizations; and make them deep. The space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be olive or large.
Sometimes the cauterization should be on the middle spot on the hip joint, resulting in four cauterizations.
If you prefer, cauterize with a circular cautery as described for hip dislocation, ensuring it burns through the entire scab.
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is in the hip and not extending into the thigh.
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh where the pain is located; and with one cauterization on the ankle, four fingers from the outer side.
If the cautery is knife-like, the depth should match the thickness of the scab.
If the pain extends to the toes, then cauterize at the point of pain with three or four cauterizations, or more if necessary.
If the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.
Be careful in all cauterizations not to burn nerves or large arteries, as this can cause harm or contraction in the patient.
I have seen cases where cauterization on the ankle resulted in severe swelling extending to the foot, causing perforation and corruption of the entire foot. This often led to severe diarrhea and eventually death.
If the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each area in the same manner.
Some experts describe a hip cautery shaped like a circular iron, half a palm in circumference, with an opening the size of a date stone or slightly smaller.
Inside this circle, there is another third; the space between them is the size of a walnut; these circles are open on both sides; their length is one or two nuts; these are well-made iron rings; this is their form:
Then, heat in the fire until it is red and sparkles, and then place it on the hip area, with the patient lying on their healthy side. Then cauterize with three round cauterizations at once.
Leave it for three days; then apply a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and treat with ointments until healed.
Albucasis says: "Oh, sons, we rarely use this type of cauterization due to the fear of its effects and because few patients can withstand it."
But it is effective for those who endure it and locate the source of the pain.
Another type of cautery involves using two circles with perforated armules through which iron pins are inserted; their length should be two nuts or close to it.
The space between each should be the width of a finger; they should be open on the top and bottom, fitting together in this manner:
Place on the hip area, with the patient lying on the healthy side, and press your hand on the hip area; then pour hot water between the two circles, gradually heating it with a small fire, keeping it for an hour, and the patient should endure the biting and burning sensation — which feels like fire — until the biting stops.
Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash off the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.
Leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the burn's blackness disappears, leave it for a few days, and pus will drain; this is the final aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, use the same method as for the hip.
This is the hot water method, which I have already described in the treatise on medicine correction. Prepare alkali and unslaked lime in equal parts, grind them and place them in a new pot with a small hole in the bottom, enough to fit a drop.
Place an enameled pot beneath the first, and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's width, then press firmly with your hand, and let the water drip through the hole into the enameled pot below.
Collect this water, pour it over more fresh lime and alkali, making it very strong, useful in many medical operations and in cauterizing other body parts, as it acts like fire.
This is one of the medicines used for hip cauterization, such as vinegar and honey mixed with lime and soap.
Gualia recounts an ancient remedy and cure for hip and sciatic vein pain, highly praising it, saying it requires no other treatment, and that it heals in one application as he described, quickly entering the bath and emerging cured.
Take fresh rue, or if unavailable, fresh figs; crush them well with a bit of fat and place on the painful hip, thigh, or leg, and bind it.
Leave it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then bathe the patient, and when the body is warm, expose it to the sun, as the pain will cease and healing will occur.
Be aware that cauterization with these medicines should only be used after body evacuation.
However, Escorides said that cauterizing the sciatic vein with goat fat is beneficial; do this by soaking wool in old oil, placing it between the foot's bones and the ankle.
Then take dry goat fat, burn it to charcoal, place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Repeat this process until the biting sensation reaches the hip, alleviating the pain.
This method of cauterization is called cow cautery.
Chapter Forty-Two:
On the cauterization for back pain.
Sometimes pain is in the back due to various causes, such as a fall, an impact, excessive evacuation, and similar reasons, due to the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cauterization is only applicable in this specific type caused by the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary, after evacuating the patient with purging pills or similar, to make three lines on the painful back area according to its width, marking with ink five or more cauteries on each line, depending on the patient's tolerance and the strength of the cautery.
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you want, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medium-sized cautery in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Three:
On the cauterization at the beginning of hump formation.
This disease often occurs in young children; the sign of its onset in children is a swelling and movement on their back.
You will find that the last vertebra of the back and its surrounding areas start to rise above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner: That the cautery covers the entire area of the vertebra equally.
And if you want, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines. And the points should be close to each other.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.
But be careful not to use cauterization on humps caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four:
On the cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And so, when gout caused by cold is treated with a method of care and the pain is not removed, then cauterization is used.
And you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And it should be olive-shaped cauterization, which is as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain moves to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries, covering the entire area with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize and do not press too hard with the cautery, just around the thickness of the skin.
And if the pain moves to the knee and back, then apply the cautery we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, called chiragra, then puncture around the joints, making two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture around the joints on each knuckle and on the thumb of the hand.
And if the pain moves to the elbows or muscles after a few days, then cauterize each part of the arms.
And do not evacuate the patient from a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five:
On the cauterization for ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines protrude before the hernia, and this is just beginning, it is necessary to tell the patient to stop eating on that day and use gentle substances to help the hernia descend from the abdomen.
Then place the patient on their back between your hands, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines appear.
Then return it with your fingers and mark with ink the rupture over the bone of the groin with a sign whose end resembles half a circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like this:
Until it is very red and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and keep it there until you reach the bone of the groin, and repeat if you haven't reached the bone the first time.
And wisely observe the emergence of the intestine during the cauterization, so as not to burn the intestine and cause death or other serious harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will not be effective.
And the cautery for children should be delicate according to their size and measurement.
Then treat the cautery site for three days with butter until the scar from the burn is removed.
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound and the place are sealed.
And it is necessary to adjust their nutrition according to the length of their healing time to support their abdomen, and to prevent the intestine from protruding during the recovery effort.
And when they want to get up after forty days, provide them with decent support, and keep them under observation for another forty days.
And they should refrain from labor, overeating, drinking, and loud voices, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen. If you want to prevent them from protruding at the beginning, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, ensuring that about a third of the skin is removed. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not be retracted.
Some earlier practitioners have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape, as it is marked with a probe:
A line is placed horizontally on the upper side of the rupture, and another line above; then place your hand with a nail-like cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter Forty-Six:
On the cauterization for twists.
When pain occurs in some members due to a fall or an impact, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be done according to the size and strength of the member, and the location of the twist and pain.
Therefore, if it heals with the first cautery, it is good; if not, then repeat the cautery. For the custom of these pains is that they are punctured from one member to the next, and it is necessary to continue with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter Forty-Seven:
On the cauterization for leprosy.
Leprosy sometimes benefits greatly from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, when you want to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is starting and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, and if it is not stopping, and you fear the disease will spread throughout the patient's body, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second lower down, near the forehead at the hairline, two on the horns, and one at the back, on the nape or neck.
And press your hand with the cautery slightly until it imprints a small mark on the bone, and the scabs are removed, so that the release of thick vapors is facilitated; and cauterize the spleen as previously described.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is visibly manifest, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, two cauteries on the cheeks, two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, a large one near the tailbone, one on the elbow, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the elbows, two on the muscles, two on the soft parts of the chest; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers and toes, on each heel, and on the joints of the hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves over the heel.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the groin, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more beneficial and effective it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because their body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small depending on the members and joints as previously described for the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour with honey and other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight:
On the cauterization for stupor.
When any limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but is not healed, then you must cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size and importance.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Sometimes numbness that affects the hands and feet, the vertebrae of the back, and the emergence of the nerves that move the limb is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But only someone knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body should perform this.
Chapter Forty-Nine:
On the cauterization of albaras (white patches), which is morphea.
When albaras is old and does not respond to any medical ointment, then cauterize it with a deep cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness and color are removed and the color is changed.
Then treat it with barley and lentil flour mixed with rose oil, leaves of arnagrosa, and blood of a pigeon or swallow. Each should be in equal parts, all mixed together, and then spread on a cloth and placed on the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty:
On the cauterization for cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its perimeter.
Wise men say it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center, but I have not seen this done, as I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen this happen sometimes.
It is better to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
Chapter Fifty-One:
On the cauterization of abscesses.
When any abscess is slow to mature, either because of excess causing it, the patient's old age, their decrepit state, low blood, or the weather, and you want to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; then leave it as it will hasten the maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery in this shape: place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that lower area, so the body of the abscess is relieved; then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two:
On the cauterization of corrodent ulcers.
Corrodent is a moving corruption in the limb, which eats it away like fire consuming dry wood.
So if you see this corrodent in a place that can tolerate fire cautery, then heat several small nail-like cauteries, making them large as needed for the location of the corrodent.
Then cauterize all around it until you eradicate all the corrosion and no trace of it remains.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a mixture of ground alum and oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
But if after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, it is good; otherwise, repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted places.
Corrodent is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, which is applied in place of cautery. However, fire cautery is usually more effective.
I have already discussed the treatment with sharp medicine in another section, so use that when necessary.
Chapter Fifty-Three:
On the cauterization of calluses and similar conditions.
Often, a disease called "clau" (callus) appears on the lower parts of the foot, causing thick, painful skin that injures the foot; cautery for these can be done in two ways: with fire or with hot water.
Fire cautery involves heating a concave cautery tool resembling a vulture's claw, made of iron, matching the size of the callus, with thin edges.
Then place the heated tool on the callus and move it around the callus until the cautery penetrates the callus completely. Leave it for three days until it starts to throw off the callus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on overnight, as it will eradicate the callus from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
If this doesn't work, and this often happens on the skin surface, especially on the hands and feet, then you need to apply hot water cautery. Take a cannula made of brass, iron, or a vulture's feather, and place it on the callus; pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, compressing it fully with your hand, and pressing the cannula's edge into the callus root. The hot water will find its way to the root. The patient should endure the hot water's bite for an hour, then remove it, as the callus with its roots will be eradicated.
Do the same for all such calluses on the body.
Then treat them with ointments that generate flesh once the callus roots are eradicated.
Chapter Fifty-Four:
On the cauterization for tremors.
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever caused by cold, or other similar causes, then cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and one on the chest, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery.
This will calm the tremor and hasten the healing of the cold-induced illness.
Chapter Fifty-Five:
On the cauterization of white pustules affecting the body.
When the body is afflicted with white pustules, which are caused by thick, corrupt materials; at the onset, cauterize each pustule with a thin cautery stick made from myrtle wood, its tip burned; or with long erestology roots; or with a lenticular cautery.
Sometimes, this cautery is used at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; they are not burned through, and the excess causing them is disrupted, thus they heal.
However, this should be done after bloodletting.
Chapter Fifty-Six:
On the cauterization for arterial bleeding caused by an incision.
Often, arterial bleeding occurs due to an incision from an external wound, from the incision of abscesses, or from cautery of a limb, and such cases are difficult to manage.
When this happens, quickly apply your hand to the artery's opening, pressing your index finger firmly over it until the blood flow stops.
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, blowing on them until they are very hot.
Take a small or large cautery, depending on the location and wound size, and quickly apply it to the artery as you remove your finger, keeping it in place until the blood flow is cut off and stopped.
If blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, quickly take another cautery prepared in the fire and continue this until the blood is restrained.
Be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, to avoid causing further harm to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have mentioned, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, for when it is drawn out, the ends are better burned and the bleeding is stopped, or it is tied with a thread or by strong binding, or medicines with the property of stopping bleeding are applied to it; and they are pressed with an appropriate compress.
But one who administers proper restriction by binding and compressing with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar methods, will not succeed except late.
But if this happens to someone and neither the doctor nor medicine is present, then act by calmly placing the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply strong pressure until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery; and the artery is sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is coagulated and thickened; and then consider whether it needs cautery or medicine.
On incisions and punctures and cupping and phlebotomy and wounds and their like.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all diseases for which cautery with fire is suitable, and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes for it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters from the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that it may be easier for those seeking it, to find what they have requested.
And before I begin, it is necessary, sons, that you learn that in this chapter, there is something terrifying that is also in the first chapter of cauterization.
And for that reason, great caution is necessary, because in the operations described in this chapter, many times evacuation involves blood, in which life is contained, through the spilling from a vein, incision on an abscess, opening of a fistula, cleaning a wound, extraction of an arrow, or cutting of a stone, and similar procedures. And all these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most of them, death can occur.
And I warn you not to let hesitation fall upon you, because sometimes you may encounter men with many different kinds of diseases. And some of them will become angry with their illness and will be on the verge of death, due to the severity of what their illness entails, and due to the prolonged duration of their illness, and with the illness, there is fear which signifies death.
And some of them will give you their possessions and say that they hope for a cure, while their illness is pernicious.
And thus, it is not proper for you to agree to help those who come to you in this manner; and let your caution be greater than greed and rapacity; and do not undertake any case unless you have certain knowledge that verifies it for you, and which brings praiseworthy success.
And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and indication of that which turns into health, for this helps you in acquiring fame and memory, praise, and glory.
Oh, sons, may God inspire you with His understanding and not take away from you direction and protection, for that is in His hands.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing by chapters as in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that it is easier for you to find what you seek and what you need.
First chapter.
On the treatment of water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children during childbirth or when the nurse squeezes the child's head too tightly.
And sometimes it happens for an unknown hidden reason.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death followed quickly, and so it seemed to me a neglected task in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was so enlarged that he could not hold it up due to the size of his head, and the humidity increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the scalp and the bone, or it is collected under the bone above the brain.
For the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the scalp and the bone and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to cut in the middle of the head with a fissure in the width, and the length of the fissure should be about two nuts so that the moisture can flow, and this is the shape of the incision:
And if the moisture is more increased and the swelling is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone, a sign of it is that you see the seams of the head open in all parts and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand at the inner parts, and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary to cut in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
and near the incision, extract all the moisture; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and sponges; and then anoint the area with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tentacles and ointments, and bind the head with equal pressure; and feed the patient with dry food with little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.
And there is another manner of incision, which considers where the swelling and collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the back, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and then attend to the incision where the swelling and collection of water appear, and do this as best as possible.
And observe not to cut the artery, lest there be a flow of blood and the patient die from that flow of blood with the evacuation of moisture.
Second chapter.
When someone has cataracts or rheums in the eyes or the chest, and this is old, and the treatment with medicines does not help, then the final treatment for this is the incision of those two arteries.
And then, when you want to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shaves his head, and then rubs the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then the patient's neck is tightened with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and the places of each are over the places near the ears that are depressed, and they are so hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with the knife of each part, with the incision reaching the bone, and let this be across the width of the head.
And if you want, insert the knife under the artery and cut it to the parts above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers together, because when a vein is incised, the blood exits with a pulsed egress, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the feeling, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of the space of three fingers, and then mark with a probe, and cut to the bone.
e fort leu ne geta de lu mays o mens, e tot aquo es segon la quantitat la qual appareys de la vertut del malaute e de la replecio de la arceria de lu. And what is necessary to draw from the blood is the amount of one ounce of wine, and then draw more or less, and all this is according to the amount that appears from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause remains on the bone from the brain, then incise this so that a swelling does not form.
And then tighten the wound with sponges and linen cloth bindings, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When someone has ancient migraines or severe cataracts due to agrimonial moisture and quality in the temple nerves, or ancient and severe sleepiness similar to those, and it is treated with medicinal methods and this does not help, then we have tried for these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of them is that the patient shaves the hairs which are in the temples; and pay attention to the apparent artery in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in few men due to the force of rubbing.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or bathe the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly to you. And then you take the knife of which this is the shape: And then you strip the scalp with it easily until you reach the artery; and then you remove it from there and extract it to the upper parts until you extract it from the scalp and uncover it from the tunics which are under it, in all parts.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the probe, and then incise a part of it according to the amount by which its ends are extended and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, because if they are not incised, the blood will not flow at all.
And then remove one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or long cords, and do not allow it to rot before the wound is consolidated and a blood flow occurs.
And then cut the excess which is between the two ties; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you want, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until the ends of it are incised, and it will remain in place of the same work.
And it is a better operation unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is one of those causes that help with ending moisture, and therefore it is better in the summer.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cotton, and place well-made powders over it, and then treat it with dry medicines that make the flesh grow and with poultices until it is healed.
And if during the operation another time there is a blood flow from the artery, then quickly stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the place with cotton, and tighten it with your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those methods are present to you, then place your finger over the place until the blood is coagulated, and then bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness rests, and tighten it as necessary.
And what is easier in artery extraction is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, since you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very ignited, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that what is between its ends is elongated, because they are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be even. But however if they are less sharp than two blades it is better, because if they are as sharp as two blades they will quickly rub together, and will not cut the flesh quickly.
So when there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut easily.
And this work is better in every procedure and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter 4.
On the treatment of sharp and acidic tears in the eyes.
When the tears are acidic, and they come from the veins on the outer surface of the head, and no medicinal treatment helps, and the patient's face becomes red and feels a crawling sensation on the forehead as if ants are moving, and their eyes are weakened and moist to the point where the eyelashes become noticeable, and the eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients advised treating this with the following operation, which is now detailed with a knife.
You instruct the patient to shave the hair on their forehead, and then make three incisions on the forehead evenly spaced along its length. If the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second according to the length slightly from the movement of the nerves which are in the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.
Beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides, and extend your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the width of three fingers placed together.
And have ready a piece of sponge or soft dried cloths to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the shape of the incision: that is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Strip off all the scalp that is between the two incisions with the instrument that is over the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision another instrument called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Place the sharp side towards the flesh attached to the scalp, and the other side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes with it.
But continue the incision so that the scalp appears, and then do this in the middle incision to the other incision.
And if an equal amount of blood flows, squeeze the places of the pieces of coagulated blood.
Then place old cotton in each fissure, and place powders soaked in wine and oil and sour wine on them, and ensure that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
On the treatment of tears from catarrh and those descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone has acute and continuous catarrh, and sometimes the patient's eyes are strained, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and losing their eyelashes, and there is sharp pain in the head and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and catarrh come from many veins of the internal parts.
And the best treatment for them is this: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, slightly across the width (and start with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and extend your hand away from the nerves of the temples which are damaged towards the chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. Then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you untie this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then rub the bone until flesh starts to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that makes the flesh grow, as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mix it, and make a plaster from it and apply it to these wounds until the flesh grows naturally.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, like iron and glass, or it is from a plant like a pea or bean, or it is a flexible thing like water and sour wine and similar substances, or some animal.
And so when a stone falls into the ear or another similar thing that does not get stuck or grow in the ear, hold the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then drip some violet or sesame oil into it, and then administer its extraction, and make the person sneeze, and block the nostrils to prevent sneezing. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upwards, as many times it is expelled with these actions.
And if it is not expelled, then administer its extraction with the instrument called "gesti epicicarios," which has this shape:
And if it is expelled with "gesti," good; if not, then administer its extraction with a subtle hook of little duplication.
And if it is not expelled by this, then make a brass cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that only the cannula is open. Then extract with your breath with strong suction, for many times with this we have succeeded.
But if it is not expelled in this way, then take some "alum" or "vecz" used for catching birds in a small amount, and place it on the end of a stick, and then wrap it with cotton decently placed. Then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And if it is not expelled with all the methods we have described, then hurry to cut it before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its virtue, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear towards the thickness of it in the well-pressed place. And let the incision be of a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, and, having found the stone, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the thing falling into the ear is one of the fats that grow and swell, then administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin and subtle spatula of this shape: and use it for the excision of that lump which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in many pieces, and then extract it with hooks or subtle gestures, or by incision as we have said, for its extraction is made easier.
But for water that has entered the ear, the patient should sneeze at the beginning, and fill the ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear with the water in it, and if this expels it, good; if not, then take some thin and long stones according to the length of a finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and the patient should insert one of them into the hole of their ear and jump on one foot of that side and strike with another stone on the stone inside the ear. Then do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Then do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled. And the water will already be expelled if you take some paper or cloth, and place one end of it in the ear and extend the other end over the fire until most of it is burnt.
And then put another cloth and do this many times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as said above for extracting the stone.
But for the extraction of an animal entering that ear, if it is a small thing like a flea or something similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large thing that is visible to the senses, then administer its extraction with hooks and forceps, and the reason for it is easier than all other things that fall into the ear.
But for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and it does not work, then you need to hold the ear to the sun.
And if some cause of the worms appears, then extract it with hooks or subtle forceps, but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, which has this shape: And insert the subtle end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you to come out, then seal and close around the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations that the ancients have already tried in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your infusion with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear be done with this instrument, which has this shape: And make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and flat on top.
And then press down on what is in the concavity of the cannula to inject it where necessary. And if you want, take the rod and wrap the end of it with cotton decently, then pour oil into the concavity of the hearing, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula — which is in the ear —, then insert the rod with the cotton on it and press it with your hand with tempered compression until the oil is expelled into the hearing concavity and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is poured into the ear should be warmed a little with fire. And beware that the substance you drip into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII
On the treatment of ear blockage.
Sometimes some children are born from their mothers' wombs with unperforated ears, and this also happens in some men, blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing in it; and this blockage sometimes occurs in the opening of the ear canal that does not reach the eardrum, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And the one that occurs in the opening, which does not affect the eardrum, is in the worst conditions for difficult healing.
And in the one that affects the eardrum, you should hold the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then if you see apparent blockage, open it with a subtle spatula of which this is the shape:
With the end of it having a small width, with one part sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be double-edged so as not to cause injury to the ear.
And if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or in the canal, then hold it with subtle forceps and incise it with great care until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the opening of the ear, then take a fine rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then put it into the ear canal.
And then if you have felt the blockage with what the patient finds easy, due to hearing heaviness, ease the pressure on it gently; and take care not to damage the nerves of the ear.
And then place a piece of cloth in the ear according to the width of the opening which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's consolidation; or take wool and soak it in water and sprinkle it over the wound; and if you see the ear already swollen, then you need to remove the wool and replace it with another wool which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the swelling has subsided; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use another treatment that restricts the blood flow, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter VIII
On the treatment of styes that occur on the eyelids.
Styes that occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet, sometimes dry.
Then you need to hold them with forceps or pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots, and then place crushed herbs over the spots.
But if pain with a flow of blood comes, then you cauterize them with a fine lancet cautery.
And the best cauterization is after the incisions and sometimes returning when some root cause remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that appears on the eyelids.
Sometimes, something appears on the eyelids that resembles hailstones in its hardness and strength, and thus is called "hailstone."
It is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelid.
So the procedure is to examine if the swelling is moving across the eyelid and its cause is minor.
Then make a lateral incision, and easily scrape it from all sides until it escapes, then lift it with a hook and remove it.
If the swelling is large, then stitch it and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there will be no harm as the ointment will restore and heal it.
If the swelling moves inward towards the inner surface of the eyelid, then evert the eyelid, lift the swelling with a hook, and press it from all sides. If the eyelid is elongated by the incision, it causes no harm.
After the incision, wash the eye with saltwater and treat the wound with something that promotes healing until it is cured.
Chapter 10.
Treatment of 'axcirnah' on the upper eyelid.
Axcirnah is a growth that forms on the membranes of the upper eyelid, mostly in children, causing heaviness in their eyes and resulting in morning discharge; they cannot tolerate bright sunlight as tears flow from their eyes.
You will see them lying on their faces all the time, sleeping on their faces; the lower eyelids and eyebrows are wet and swollen, and you can feel the swelling when you press the area with your fingers.
One method is to have the patient rest their head on your lap, place a cloth on it, make a circular incision around the swelling, and press it with your fingers to gather the swelling in the center. Then, make a small lateral incision into the center of the swelling, no larger than a phlebotomy incision.
But in more severe cases, you must cut through the entire layer to reach the swelling, as in more advanced stages the swelling appears as a white substance.
Then extract it with cloths wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hands until it is removed.
Be careful not to press too much into the incision to avoid damaging the eye.
If the swelling does not appear initially, gently press the incision until the swelling emerges, then extract it as described. Soak cloths in water and vinegar, place them on the area, and press with powders.
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dry out the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it heals.
If an abscess forms, treat it with cedar plaster until it heals.
Chapter 11.
On methods of treating 'tactimi' of the eye.
When hair grows on the eyelids under the natural lashes and becomes hardened, it irritates the eye and causes conditions such as constant tearing and softening of the eyelids, which can lead to eye damage called 'tactini.' It is treated in four ways: by cautery with fire; with sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; by making incisions and sutures; or by using canes, as I will describe.
Rest the patient's head on your lap, turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, it is good; if not, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid, penetrate the upper part, near the eyelid margin where the hairs grow, and pull the thread up through the eyelid.
Make an incision on the inner part of the eyelid below the abnormal hairs from the major to the minor lacrimal, then extract the thread, place small powders of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and suture the eyelid in a shape like a myrtle leaf.
The shape should correspond to the elevation of the eyelid, which varies among people, as some require a large amount of the eyelid to be incised according to the extent of the softening.
Then make the incision along the two marked lines, starting from the major to the minor lacrimal. And your incision near the natural hairs should be as thick as a king's hair.
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the cut, scrape it entirely, align the two edges with a thread or fine wool, wipe the blood, and adhere the excess threads to the two eyebrows with a sticky substance if desired, otherwise don't bother.
Leave the stitches for three to four days, then treat it.
If you wish, leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and tightens, as the eyelid will elevate due to the wound sealing and fluid accumulation; but suturing is better. This is what the ancients say about 'taxanir.'
Be attentive to the patient, it is a good procedure, and there is no danger in it.
Another method in 'taxmir' is to mark a myrtle leaf shape on the eyelid, lift the eyelid with three separated and gathered hooks as follows:
If it is not possible to use the hooks, take a needle with a thread, insert it in the middle of the shape, another thread near the major lacrimal, and another near the minor lacrimal, hold the threads evenly, and lift the entire marked area as described.
Then stitch the two edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.
If an abscess forms near your incision or wound, treat it with plaster and ointment.
Sometimes the eyelid hair turns inward, then you should use the described incision method; but suturing is more skillful.
Treating with canes follows this method: Turn the eyelid and cut the described shape; then make two thin canes or slivers with a length matching the eyelid and a width less than the incision. Make incisions at the ends of each part where you hold the threads.
Gently place each cane over the excess eyelid tissue, bind them tightly, and leave them for several days; the tissue will die and fall off by itself.
If delayed, break it with forceps, and treat the wound until it heals.
Once healed, the eyelid will be lifted, and the hairs will not irritate.
This is the method of making two canes as described: They should be the correct length and width, no more, no less.
Chapter XII.
On the elevation of painful eyelashes in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough, and painful to the eyes, then the procedure is to take a fine needle, insert a fine silk thread into it, and then tie the ends of the thread in a very delicate manner. The length of the threads should be about the size of a palm.
Then prepare another fine thread similarly and tie its ends if you wish.
Then have the patient rest their head on your lap and be near the sunlight so that your work is visible, as this is a delicate and fine procedure.
Next, insert the needle at the root of the hair that needs treatment, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up and insert it into the conjunctiva, dealing with one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then pull your hand until the hair is removed with the conjunctiva in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the conjunctiva is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the conjunctiva downward with the thread you have prepared until the conjunctiva is removed from the upper hole.
Then you will see this with your eye's vision, for then you will remove the conjunctiva and the thread, and each will bleed and seal the eye, leaving the seal for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
If the hair is shorter, you then attach a longer hair from the natural ones, and it is elevated with it, or you leave it until it lengthens a bit, and then you lift it.
Chapter XIII.
On the treatment of contracture which appears on the upper eyelid.
When contracture occurs in the eye, it is a contraction of the eyelid that is drawn upward or to the right or left due to improper healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called "leporina." This contracture is either natural or accidental, caused by the improper healing of a wound, incisions, or cauterizations, or something similar.
The way to operate on this is to cut through the consolidation and separate the edges of it, then place a piece of linen cloth between them and bind them until they are healed.
And you should not use drying or constricting treatments because if you do, the contracture will return worse than ever before.
Use softening treatments such as fenugreek, and wash with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, or an ointment called 'diachylon,' which is liquefied with some oils, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat with that.
The key to your treatment is to ensure by all means that the wound does not consolidate as it did initially.
This procedure we have described is merely a correction of the contracture that does not return the place to its original form.
Chapter XIV.
On the treatment of contracture that occurs on the lower eyelid.
This contracture which occurs on the lower eyelid, which is truly called contracture; some are natural, others accidental.
But accidental contracture is caused by a wound, incision, cauterization, or other similar causes.
The procedure for this is to take a needle with a double thread, insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upward with the needle and suture it with the needle, making a wide incision. Then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; if not, take the needle and place it in the split shape, and with it turn the eyelid, making two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two incisions form two angles of the incision, which you have made to converge, and let their shape form an angle that, when joined together, forms a figure.
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is on the edge of the lower part of it, where it cuts the eyelid.
Then bring the separated parts together and suture them with woolen thread; treat them with what we have mentioned about softening medicines and warm applications until it is healed.
If the contracture occurs due to a fissure, suture, or cauterization, then you must cut with a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as described before. Then separate with the warm application between the two edges as we have described.
In summary, the treatment of contracture whether above or below, proceeds with the operation according to the prepared form of the contracture, which is of various kinds.
And the wise practitioner always prepares in every possible way to restore the shape to its natural form, or as close to it as possible, and treats the patient according to the requirements of the operation and the instruments with the best arrangements.
Chapter XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the upper eyelid is joined with the white of the eye, and its movement and natural functions are hindered, then you must insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook.
Then you cut the adhesion with a fine instrument, which should not have a sharp point, but be somewhat blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the instrument without damaging the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision scrape away the adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.
Then put salty water in the eye and wash it; or drip into it fennel juice dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidating treatments until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh in the lacrimal glands.
You should know that a nail grows in two ways: either it is hard and nerve-like, resembling a hard thin film; or it is non-nerve-like, resembling coagulated white moisture, which when touched by iron, must be taken with a hook, cut off, and the hook is not inserted into it.
Both types originate from the main lacrimal gland and gradually cover the vision, blocking light and the movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on this involves having the patient rest their head on your lap, opening their eyes, lifting the eyelid with your hand, then grasping the nail with a hook and gently extending it upward. Then take a needle and insert a hair from a horse, ox, cow, or similar animal, or a strong thread, doubling the end of the needle little by little and inserting it into the middle of the nail, penetrating it with the needle, and tying the nail with the thread; extend it upward, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that touches the pupil. Thus, you follow it with the hair until the back of it.
Then you cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine instrument or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that continuous tears do not occur from cutting it.
Sometimes the nail is extended with just the hook or thread as we have said, and then it is scraped with a sharp-edged lion’s instrument, which has this shape:
And be careful not to touch the corneal layer with the instrument, causing it to tear, and not to perforate the pupil.
After the incision, put a little crushed salt or made-up powder of siniar into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
If the nail is not nerve-like and you cannot insert the needle, nor the hook, then many times this type of nail is treated with medicines and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
If you want to cut it, then open the patient’s eye and take a fine lion’s instrument with a sharp edge according to this shape: with precision. If you see that it is rarefied and confused and penetrates the root, then drip some of your saliva into the eye with powder made of siniar or with red powder or crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until everything that is there is removed, unless the opposite ulcer is in the eye, then you leave it and treat the ulcer initially until it is healed.
Then repeat your operation on it until it is healed.
The prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms the eye greatly, should be suspended with a hook; cut it off partially, but do not complete the incision to prevent continuous tearing.
Then drip red powder made of siniar into the lacrimal gland until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the incision of alguazardenic and of what grows from flesh attached in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh grows and covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and firmly closes the eyelids from the outside and resembles a pomegranate flower.
But the operation is that the patient places their head on your lap; then you open their eyes and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks, hold it with a forceps or tweezers; then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with a knife, and be careful not to damage the eye during the operation.
And let your incision with which you cut be done either with the fine instrument we mentioned in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors which are adapted according to the form of what is described in this chapter.
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white over the eye until it is safe from ulceration.
If there remains any cause of alguazardenic and you fear a serious ulcer, leave the eye and treat the ulcer with what heals that ulcer, then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly treat the flesh attached to the eye of this kind.
However, you must avoid any treatment of the delicate eye either naturally or accidentally with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part can endure that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
On the collection of sabel in the eye.
Sabel are red veins that are spread over the eye and prevent its functioning, weakening the eye over time.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the eye in which there is sabel is strong and if there is no other disease in the eye besides sabel, then you gather that sabel.
You command the patient to place their head on your lap, then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgement; and let that hook be of a fine duplicating form like this:
or two hooks gradually combined into one like this:
Then gather those veins with fine forceps, with precision, and stop the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and rolled back.
And be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the instrument; and if your operation is at noon before the sun, be very firm in your operation and only cut those veins.
When you have completed, then you drip into the eye green or red powder so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the sabel.
But if it is not possible for you to gather everything at that time, then you apply everything with what relieves its pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is soothed and it is safe from ulceration.
Then repeat the treatment in the same manner until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors:
Chapter XIX.
On the reduction of arizati to the nose.
When you treat arizati with cauterization or sharp, burning medicine according to the previous narration and it is not healed, then there is no method except to cut over the ulcer towards its maturity, and extract all the moisture in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
Then when the bone is exposed and you see in it corruption or blackness, you scrape it with an instrument which has this form:
And it is called an aspre cap, made of Indian iron, with a round head like a rasp made pointed by the puncturing of a file or finely sharpened (as in the following form).
Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
Do this several times, then restore the place with drying and astringent substances.
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the core of the ulcer is removed and it remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and does not ulcerate and no accident occurs in it, then you know it is healed.
If not, then there is no method except to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you expose the bone with iron or sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take a rasp in this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thin and extend to the tip as sometimes like this.
Then place it on the bone, near the lacrimal; extend your hand a little from the eye, then rotate your hand with the rasp until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels air coming out when you touch his hand.
Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines as instructed.
Then when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which was flowing outside returns to the nose, making it lighter for the patient.
Chapter XX.
On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and does not cause harm or impairment in vision, you should leave the patient, follow up, and apply cupping on the neck without scarification and suck well; then apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, resin, and sarcocolla on the eye, and tighten the dressing on the eye with many layers.
The way to make the layers is to take cloths of lion hair, each cloth folded in four layers; and make those layers.
Then place them one on top of the other according to the amount needed by the eye. Then tighten them with a hard cloth with strong pressure; repeat the cupping without scarification; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tight day and night.
But if the binding becomes soft in the meantime, then it needs to be very tight.
Then remove the binding day and night as we have said.
And if the eye is already reduced, that is good; if not, then repeat the plaster with the layers, the pressure, and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter XXI.
On the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic.
When there is a disruption in the uveal tunic, and it protrudes and projects outside the eyelids like a grape, and distorts a person's appearance, and you want to cut it, the operation is as follows: you insert the needle at the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread at the lacrimal part, make it penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; then cut the place of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it firmly.
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye and leave it until the thread and the uvea fall off.
Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.
Sometimes a large prominence forms in the eye and is attached all around with a circle of cloth, then it should be perforated with a fine instrument to come to the front of the eye, and let the white fluid flow, and the eye will descend and fit immediately.
Then tighten until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of alconati.
This disease called alconati is not anything but a fluid which is attached in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not that.
The way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides and move it until you see the fluid come to the lower parts, and it dries and does not descend, and the vision is clear, and the patient sees things as before.
If it does not descend, you know it is water.
If the descent is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a fine instrument and make a small incision on the panniculus towards the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the circle (in the empty place), until the fluid is expelled.
Then when it is expelled, you drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled.
Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of descending water in the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division and which ones are appropriate to perforate, with an explanatory speech, then according to the health.
Then you need to make the patient sit between your hands on a square seat and bind his healthy eye, very tightly.
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye if the water is in the left eye; or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then with your right hand take the almagda (surgical instrument), if the eye is the left; or with your left hand if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the almagda near the edge by the thickness of a ray in the white of the eye on the side of the lesser lacrimal, and push the almagda firmly and rotate your hand with it.
Then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almagda has reached an empty space.
And the measure of the path of the almagda to the front should be the measure of the space from the pupil to the edge of the blackness, which is the corona of the eye; because you will see the pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the almagda into the location where the water is, and pull it down once and again, and if the water descends immediately, then see that the patient recovers his vision immediately, with the almagda in his eye.
Then let him rest a bit; if the water has descended, then place it again before removing the almagda.
Then when it is dry and does not descend, remove the almagda easily, and rotate your hand with it little by little, then dissolve a little clear gem salt in water and wash the eye with it; then place cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white on the eye and bind the healthy eye with it.
But we and those of our time place over it a dressing soaked in egg white.
And if the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye due to its hardness — because there are some men whose eyes are very hard —, then you need to take the instrument called alberid, which has this form:
And then pierce that junction with it, and do not delay your hand in the hole, but make a path for the almagda to a subtle place.
Then insert the almagda as we have said.
And after completing your work, prepare a proper sleeping place for the patient where he can sleep on his back in a dark house, and he is prohibited from all movements.
And apply to the nature of it what will soothe his nature, and do not let his head move to the right or left at all.
And let the binding be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Then unbind it in that dark house and expose the weak sight, and let him see some things, then rebind it until the seventh day.
And you should not do this at the time of treatment or immediately after the infusion. First, you need to avoid this because the water can move easily with great and forceful regard.
But if an abscess happens, then you need to unbind the eye before the seventh day, and correct it with what relieves the abscess.
Then you release the vision and place on his face a cover to protect the vision for a few days while staying in the dark house.
Then gradually move him out of that house and return him to his normal activities.
And know that in the operation the student of vision is not excused at times, so be brave about the operation.
It has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and someone said that fire is made in Ayrac with the perforated almagda by which the water is sucked out.
But however, I have not seen anyone in our land who has done this perfectly, nor is this written in any of the ancient books; it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaan (another surgical instrument) for those who do not know them:
And they should be made of brass or properly of iron, and their ends should be with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end like this is the form.
Chapter XXIV.
On the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
When in the nose various kinds of flesh grow together, some of which resemble a scorpion in shape or a fish polyp; and this ailment is called polypus because it resembles that fish in appearance. And some of it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of dark color; and some of it is flesh not dark in color.
So, in that which is these non-fraudulent and non-cancerous fleshes, you must make the patient sit between your hands and face the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your nail into those fleshes. And then extract it to the outer parts, and then cut what you have comprehended from it with a sharp and fine spatula from one part until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if any part of it remains that can be excised, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily until no part of it remains. But if it rules with blood or a hot abscess occurs, then you apply what is needed to it; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all cavities are sealed.
Then put into the nose near the incision some sour wine and water or just wine. But if the nose is open and moisture flows into the palate, then you know it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside it is flesh growing in the highest bones of the nostrils to which excision has not reached.
Then you need to insert a bile from which there is some thickness, and mix it with many nuts, and place between each nut the amount of a finger or less, and make the patient swallow and insert one end of the bile into the nostrils with a ray or another suitable instrument.
And after that is done, he should draw in his breath until it reaches the nasal canals and exits over his throat, because sometimes similar actions are done by children at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the bile, one end that comes out of the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a closure of flesh with the nuts that are in the bile, and do this until you know that the flesh has gone with the nuts of the bile.
Then extract the bile, and place in the nose after the blood extraction a piece of gauze, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
And at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed.
But if you need a drying cure, use that.
And this is the form of the capipurge instrument with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
Make this of silver or brass, which should be like a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the nozzle likewise.
And if you want, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tube of the capipurge instrument should be flat, open; with a handle on the back of it, with which you hold it when heating it in the oil or whatever you want from the juices and absorbable substances.
Chapter XXV.
On warts born on the ends of the nose.
Many times a wart is born on the ends of the nose, and it is enlarged and increased in some days so that it is very noticeable.
And therefore you must cut it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it. Then place on the site either a cautery or burning medicine which stays on the spot.
But if its excision is delayed until it is enlarged, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of dark color, and little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous abscess; because many times to those who cut this abscess great malice comes upon the one who had it.
And if the abscess is of a mild touch and not of dark color, and sometimes excision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the site with what dries and tightens until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
On the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by wound or similar.
Know that when a solution of continuity happens in one of these cartilages, little confers in that operation except in some men.
So, when one of these causes happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each one is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes out. And then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle over them dragon's blood and pounded incense, and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it tied for two or three days, and then untie it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads by themselves are detached, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you join the solution of continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the belly, or you join the solution of continuity with thread as you have been taught.
Chapter XXVII.
On the extraction of those causes that come in the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times it happens to many men that in the inner parts of their lips there are hard abscesses resembling grains of barley, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
So you must turn the lips and cut each of those hardnesses from every part, and then fill the site of the excision with pounded sage until the blood is stopped, and then wash it with sour wine and treat the site with what is astringent, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the incision of flesh attached to the gums.
Often, flesh attached to the gum grows, which the ancients called albulus, then you must suspend it with a nail or hold it with forceps and cut it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place on the site pounded sage or other astringent or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, because after the cautery it will not return.
Chapter XXIX.
On the scraping of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, in the inner parts and in the outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough scales attached, loose, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green, which leads to corruption in the gum and makes the teeth loose.
And so you must make the patient sit between your hands and place his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scales and sand-like substances appear until no part of them remains, and do this for the blackness, the yellowness, and the other substances until they are cleaned.
So if what is on them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, that is good; if not, then repeat the scraping on them the next day and the second and the third until you reach the final state you desire.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of various forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to different shapes, and these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly:
Chapter Thirty
On the removal of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with all ingenuity and delay any extraction because there is no substitute once it is removed, as it is a sublime substance and excuses are necessary for its extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth removed, you must be firmly certain which tooth is painful because often the pain deceives the patient into thinking it is in a healthy tooth, and you remove that one, and the pain does not cease until the actual diseased tooth is extracted, as we have seen from the work of barbers.
So when you are certain which tooth is painful and know it well, you must then scarify around the tooth with a spatula with some potency until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps initially little by little until you can shake it loose.
Then place large, strong forceps firmly around the tooth, and put the patient's head between your knees to hold it securely so it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight out in a manner that does not break it or cause the patient greater pain.
And if it is not dislocated, then take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides with ease and force its removal as done initially.
But if the tooth is hollow or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth and tighten it with the end of a fine stick so it does not break during your constriction on it with forceps.
And you must work delicately with scarification around the gum on all sides and be very careful with your strength so you do not break it and leave part of it, and cause the patient to return with a problem worse than the initial pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness with their extractions, not administering what we have recommended; because often they cause patients great ailments which are more difficult to cure than broken teeth, leaving the roots behind, or extracting the tooth with parts of the jawbone as we have often seen.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if there are blood flows because of this, as often happens, then crush some amount of sage and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that does not help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is initially moved should be of long extremity, short handle, and thick, so they do not bend when you work with them.
And they should also be with thick handles so that when you squeeze them they do not bend, and should have short extremities.
And they should be made of Indian iron properly made with straight extremities, and at the ends of them should be teeth which interlock with each other and tighten with strong constriction, and sometimes the ends should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, that is, a crane, and are for strong constriction.
Chapter Thirty-One
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
When after the extraction of a tooth that is broken some part remains, you must place cotton with alum on the site for a day or two until the site is softened; then introduce a tool or forceps whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane, the shape of the forceps:
Their ends should be made like a file or rasp inside.
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or tongs, then you must dig around the root and uncover all the flesh and introduce the instrument called "atali," which is a small lever, the shape of which is this:
And it should have a short, thick end and not be soaked so that it does not break.
So if by this the root is extracted, it is good; if not, help yourself with these other instruments, the shapes of which are: the first instrument's shape is of a triangular end with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a finer end.
And already aided by this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the shape close to the following: and with other instruments which are predecessors in the shaving of teeth; because aid is made with this instrument which is shaped like a large hook, and this is the shape:
of a triangular end bent or short, which has some thickness, and should not be soaked so it does not break.
And further know that the instruments for teeth are many and similarly the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself according to what the operation and the various diseases signify to him; because there are ailments for which the ancients did not speak nor placed proper instruments, due to their diverse shapes.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken or decayed, then care should be taken on that spot with the appropriate instruments and forceps we have mentioned in the extraction of the tooth roots, and help yourself with a tool of which this is the shape:
And it should have some thickness, little by little, and should be tightened or held with the mouth so it does not escape or flee until the entire bone is extracted; and then restore the site with appropriate medicines for that.
But if there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape that decay and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On the treatment of teeth that are prominent over the others.
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural alignment, this affects their appearance, especially when it happens to women, particularly venerable young girls; then you must consider: if a tooth is born next to another tooth and cannot be moved or aligned, then remove that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, the shape of which is this; and it resembles a pig’s snout, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.
And your incision, with which you cut it, should be over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that no other teeth are disturbed.
And if it is a prominent tooth exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, the shape of which is this:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron and easy to handle; and it should have many small points like a file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other teeth are disturbed and loosened. And then smooth it at the end and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth, part of which is broken and injures the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it should be evened out so that it does not injure the tongue or disrupt speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth are concussed and loose due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on food, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then to prevent them from falling out, they should be bound with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and then decays within a few days, but gold never changes.
And the wire should be of such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that it can fit between the teeth; and the method of its weaving is that you take the wire and pass it twice between two healthy teeth, and then twist it twice between two loose teeth, or between one or many, until it reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the side from which you started, and tighten it with ease and wisdom so that it does not become loose.
And your tightening should be such that you secure the wire to the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip.
And then cut off the excess ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and tuck them in at each place with a tool, and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened as it is.
But if it becomes loose or broken, tighten it again or them with another wire in such a manner for all time.
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the weaving of two healthy teeth and two loose ones, as these times are bound:
And when it happens that one or two teeth return to their places due to each one’s fall, and they grow back as we have described, and they remain.
And no one does this but a good and wise craftsman.
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is fitted and shaped like a tooth, and placed in the spot where a tooth is missing, and it is secured as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
On the cutting of the binding which occurs under the tongue and inhibits speech.
This binding that occurs under the tongue sometimes is natural, present at birth, or accidental and occurs due to a wound that has healed.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient’s mouth, their head resting in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then you cut that nerve binding according to the width needed to free the tongue from its restriction.
But if there is any hardness or thickening in it, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then you take a hook and cut it by the width necessary until you have cut the binding and the thickening is dissolved.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the fleshy part and that you cut here gradually so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then the incision site should be washed with rose water or vinegar or cold water; and then place under the tongue licini; this is a piece of linen that the patient keeps under their tongue each night so that it does not consolidate again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, place crushed vitriol on the site; but if the blood continues, then cauterize the site with an appropriate cautery iron. And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small nut occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions; and very quickly it grows large until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient’s mouth seated facing the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it is leaning towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the hook in it, and cut it with a thin blade, and cut it in all parts; and if blood comes to you during the operation, then you place powdered vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.
And then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of an abscess from both tonsils and those that arise in the throat and other abscesses.
When a hollow abscess occurs in the throat, it is from glands that are like wool, which occur outside and are called tonsils, which when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, dark, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron due to the blood flow; instead, leave it until it is mature, and then either you will pierce it or it will rupture by itself.
And if it is white, round, and its root is thin, then that is the one that needs to be cut.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested in a cool place with complete rest or if it has diminished somewhat; and then you have the patient sit facing the sun, and their head in your lap, and open their mouth, and the assistant holding their tongue down with a noble instrument of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
Then when you press down with it on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you look over it, then take a hook and put it in the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can. After you pull some of the tissue, then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form:
After you pull some of the tissue, then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form: It is like forceps, but the ends are curved, so that the opening of each is towards the other, very sharp, made of well-tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not present with you, then cut it with a blade of which this is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water.
But if bleeding occurs, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves and similar astringent substances until the bleeding is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two tonsils, and cut them as I have said in the cutting of the two tonsils equally.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had grown in her throat, which was dark in color, with little sensation, which had already closed off her throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and she could neither eat nor drink water, and she would have died if it had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two branches, coming out through two openings.
So I hastened surgically and inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled it, and a large portion came out, and then I cut it where I could see from the other opening, and then I opened her mouth, and held her tongue, and then I inserted the hook into that abscess.
And then I cut out a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the woman’s throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, and then took food, and I continued cutting that abscess many times over a long period, and an abscess would form in its place, which I would cut until it was prolonged.
Then I took a tool and cauterized her throat, and it ceased to form; and then I departed and did not know what God did with her afterward.
Chapter 37.
On the cutting of the uvula when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed and elongated, it is called perpendicular; and if it is swollen and round at the bottom, then it is called buba.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, and then sometimes the abscess is delicate and should be removed, then it is necessary to cut that which is swollen and round; and if it is elongated, and is bloody, dark in color or black, and has no feeling, then it is necessary to attempt its incision, because there is a danger for the patient in it.
And when you see it as I have said, its whiteness and length, that you have the patient sit and press down his tongue with an instrument of which I have described its form, and then place a hook in the uvula, and pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not cut more than what is attached beyond the natural boundary, because if you cut more, you will harm his speech.
And after the incision, use what I have recommended in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use a method of cauterization without fear, and the manner of cauterization here is with strong water, and it is that you place the patient’s head in your lap, and press down his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it to the living tissue, and place it neither thick nor thin, and with it fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Its extremity should be concave, where the medicine is placed just like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and the patient should lie on his side so that saliva or mucus does not run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto his throat and injures it.
And then hold the medicine with your hand, and squeeze it onto the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and calmed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, and dip the cotton in the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton into a tube so that the cotton adheres to the tube, and do this as many times as needed until you achieve what you want with the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it as it will dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if it is necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization clean around the uvula with cotton soaked in rose water, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat externally with ointment, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision, because it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, fenugreek and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with suitable luting, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave instrument made of bronze is placed in this manner; it can be made of silver or bronze.
And place the extremity in the patient’s mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is very fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to do this treatment at the beginning of the abscess, because it would add too much to the abscess, and it is not suitable to do this until after the abscess has been clarified.
But if this instrument is not present, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is not burned, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is beneficial for health.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and other things stuck in the throat and other issues.
Many times a fishbone or some other cause gets stuck in the throat.
Then you must extract whatever is visible, which you can see when you press the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, so that you can clearly see what is in the throat.
And for what does not appear and is hidden in the throat, make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach, because very often the cause stuck in the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, tie it firmly with thread, and have the patient swallow it, because when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will be pulled out, and then they will be expelled. And also take an eel and tie it with thread, place it inside and then pull it out gently; or take a leek, insert it gently, and then pull it out gently.
But if they are not expelled with the methods we have described, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:
It should be a bit thicker than a rod, and at the end it should be concave, which you can easily insert into the throat.
And the patient should have their head elevated, and be careful that touching the bone of the throat, so that it does not become inflamed by the bone or the thorn, or that the doctor handles it with his hand.
But it is better if the patient inserts it themselves, due to their knowledge of the location of the stuck object, and they push downwards and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount necessary until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of leeches stuck in the throat.
When a leech is treated with what we have mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument we have described.
So if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate gestures properly.
And if it is not possible to extract it with that, then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat, and place a heated iron in the concavity of the tube, and do this as many times as necessary (until the leech is dead and falls off from the throat) and the patient should abstain from water all day.
And then take a glass full of cold water, and rinse the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it and wet the mouth with the water every hour with the hand, because the leech will fall as soon as it senses the water.
But if it is not expelled with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with cumin or asafoetida with the instrument we have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall off.
And there is another method of operation in fumigation of that, which is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then do the fumigation; and the patient places their mouth on the end of the tube, and closes their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will fall off soon.
And if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times, and the patient should abstain from drinking, and eat salty foods and garlic, and not drink water, and with this regimen it is necessary that it will be expelled.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it is visible; and it is similar to forceps as seen, except that it has a certain curvature: which is placed in the throat, and its extremity is like a stork's beak, which is toothed, so that when it grasps something, it does not let it go.
Chapter 40.
In which the essence of the discourse on the opening of abscesses and their incision is discussed.
Abscesses come in many types, in many ways, as recalled in each case in this book.
And they differ in perforation and incision in two ways, one by the type of abscess itself; and by what we understand about the humors.
And the second way is according to the places on the body where they occur, because an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring on the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy part is different from one in a joint; and each has its specific treatment.
And some abscesses should not be perforated until the pus in them has matured or they are fully developed.
There are other abscesses that need to be perforated when they are still raw and not fully mature, such as abscesses near joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, it can prolong its presence until it rots the surrounding area, and soon the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, causing contraction of that limb; or it is near a vital organ, and if you delay perforation until it matures, it will harm the vital organ; or it is near the buttocks, then perforate it even if it is not mature; and you should not perforate it raw if it is not fully digested, except for the one near the buttocks, so that the core does not rot and spread to the internal parts of the buttocks, forming a fistula, or making it incurable. But you must know the right time for perforating an abscess, and that is when it is matured.
And you know it is matured when the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and also the reduction in redness and throbbing, the softening of the head of the abscess, and other signs.
And you must know that the perforation should be at the lowest part of the abscess for better drainage.
And perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the location of the muscles, tendons, or arteries; and finally, in all areas where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, perform perforation according to the nature of that part.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to delay the perforation until digestion is confirmed, as we have said; because if you perforate it before that, the abscess will prolong its course with much filth, and soon the lips of the wound will harden and deepen.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body as needed, or according to what the part requires.
And you should make a small perforation for small abscesses, and large, wide perforations or many incisions for large abscesses, according to their size.
And some abscesses need the skin to be scooped out and incised, like a loaf of bread that has already formed a crust, such as those that occur in carbuncles and buboes.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled section; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses in the groin.
And some of them are treated with a round section and a crescent-shaped section, and similar ones.
But for those without a head, like superficial abscesses, you should perforate them with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And when the abscess is large and has accumulated much pus, you should perforate it and not rush to extract all the pus at once; first extract a part of it, then seal the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and continue doing this gradually until it is completely expelled.
Especially if the patient is of weak strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit often dissipates with the release of the pus, and the patient can die quickly, and you harm them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and after you perforate these abscesses, you should cleanse the wounds and consider if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you should administer flax or old cotton; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place wicks in each hole so that they come together.
And if an abscess has part of the skin removed or you have scooped it out around the edges, then you should fill it with old cotton or linen thread, like when you have drawn out bread or roots, without moisture; and keep it tight until the third day; then proceed and treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then you should apply cold water and vinegar in which you soak a linen cloth, and place it over the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer treatment and care and powders that I have recommended in many places in this book and in sections.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you should soak powders in hot wine and oil, and place them over the area.
And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, then you should place powders soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and keep them cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should loosen the abscess and cleanse it and administer what is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general, but as per the method of distinction, I have already said about each abscess and the manner of its treatment in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses that appear on the scalp.
On the scalp, there are small abscesses, and these are of types of nodules that contain membranes; and their types are many.
And some of them are soft, and some contain fluid similar to lime. And some of them contain fluid similar to dust, and similar; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of them, there is no fear, because the extraction of them does not cause artery harm.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you test them with an instrument shaped like this, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.
For if what it contains is fluid, then you cut it with a longitudinal section as a superficial incision in this shape:
And start the incision from the line B to the line G. Then, when the fluid is evacuated, you remove that skin which contains the fluid, and leave none of it, because sometimes it returns if any of it remains.
Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment if available, or in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day, as this will corrode all that remains of that skin.
And then repeat with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are sure that there is no remaining cause of that skin; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it in this shape: with a cross-shaped incision, and cut between the two lips of the incision and remove all parts, and force your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if it causes you artery problems, then do what I first advised.
And similarly, do in the lithified abscess in incision and treatment as I have told you; and incision on a lithified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little fluid.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in some people with whom there is no fluid; the reason is because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a deaf stone, rough, white, which could not be cracked, and if anyone was struck with it, it would harm them.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, other than this, there is this chapter, such as the abscesses that come to children's heads and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And place the perforation of these at the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus to the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for their healing.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofulas that occur in the neck.
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and there are many that are generated among them, and every scrofula among them is within its own membrane, and just as in the nodules and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for among them there are some stony, and among them there are some that contain fluid, and among them there are malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.
So, in the one that you see to be in good condition upon touching, of which the color of what is evident is close to the color of the skin, and it is movable in all directions, and it is not attached to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and it is not deep, it is appropriate that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line G to line B, and peel it off completely, and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if you need them, just as we have said for abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is more careful that the vein or nerve is not incised.
And let the spatula not be very sharp, so that your hand does not slip during the incision, or disturb the patient, and you incise what is not necessary to incise; because if you incise a vein or artery and you stop your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders that stop the flow of blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to putrefy. When the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then, inquire with your index finger if there remains any cause from the other small scrofulas, then incise those and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is appropriate then that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. Before, it is appropriate that you tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you incise that whole scrofula, then it is appropriate that you join the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that no superfluity remains.
But if you see that superfluity remains due to the size of the scrofula, it is appropriate that you proceed to incise its root, and extract it and administer suture as said.
And those of the scrofulas that contain fluid, perforate them with a superficial perforation where the place of maturation appears to you, and place the perforation at the lowest part of the body, just as we have said.
And then administer the perforation, cauterize with ointment and similar substances, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then when you see the wound already cleaned, then treat it with generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On the incision of the appendage of the abscess occurring in the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it.
And this is the written account of their discourse.
But in men having injury, it is appropriate to avoid the extraction of the epiglottis, as it is not beneficial since all the veins and the main vessels of the patient are there.
But in those who have cauterized abscesses in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the trachea, it is appropriate to use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid the destruction caused by perforation.
So, when we want this, we incise the epiglottis below three circles of the circles of the epiglottis, or four with a small incision across the width at the point between two circles by amount, so that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels there are distant.
And if the physician is fearful, it is appropriate then to extend the skin of the throat with a hook, and then slit the skin until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any reason to.
And then incise the membrane as we have recounted; and it is indicated for the incision of the channel by the phlegm that comes out of it along with what is ruptured and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, join the two lips of the wound’s skin, and suture it alone without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that generate flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis said that the summary of the discourse we have recounted is nothing but that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the patient's throat, and the patient is approaching death, and the breath is interrupted, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound site for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for this, they ordered to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and the malignancy is for three days; and then they ordered to suture the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called for the treatment of it, and I found the patient as though she were dead, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the wound little by little.
Then I was assured that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the air was coming out of the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to improvement in her condition.
And now I say that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
On the incision of the abscess that occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called hernia of the throat.
This abscess called hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is according to two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is not a cause for treatment.
And the accidental one is according to two ways, one of which is similar to fatty nodules, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the obstruction of an artery, and in that there is danger. And it is not appropriate to make any attempt on it with iron except in that which is small. And you test it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty nodule, and it is not attached to any veins, then you incise it as with the nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and sac; if not, then its whole being is examined, and then treat the site with what is appropriate for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes and I have already described all the types of them in the division.
And it is appropriate that I recount thus the difference between a node and an excrescence as there is doubt.
So I say that with an excrescence there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is subdued; and putrefaction is completed and then fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a certain membrane which is its own proper sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a pea and it is made like a swelling, whether larger or smaller, and they are according to two types, for they are either fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
So it is appropriate, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, to explore it and examine it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an introducer, as its form will come in the chapter that follows this one.
And it is the method of examination of abscesses and all nodes, and it is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
And then complete your work according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the introducer and consider what has come out of the mark of it.
And if the moisture is expelled, whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out of the mark of the introducer, then know that it is fatty.
And cut over it with an incision having the form of a cross in this form: As I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from every part with ease, and preserve the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that tissue with the node.
But if it is ruptured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that tissue, and many times this happens, and then you extract it in pieces until no part of it remains.
For if any part of it remains, little or much, the node will return in the same way.
And if you see that any small part of it remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the wound, and apply over it what sets the abscess, and treat it with the other treatments until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you suture the two lips of it and treat it with what generates flesh.
But if a pulsating vein is opposite it, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the place with crushed sage that is vitriol and leave it tight for two days or three until the wound festers and the boiling of the blood rests; and then return to incise what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of the instruments necessary for cutting and perforating.
Of these, the forms of the introducers are of three kinds: one is large, another medium, and another small.
The form of the large introducer is this:
The form of the small introducer is this:
They are made of iron, with squared ends suitably, so that they quickly enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the explorers, and they are called "albered," and one of them is called "berid."
And they are of three kinds: one is large, another medium, and another small.
The form of the large explorer, its form:
The form of the medium explorer, its form:
The form of the small explorer, its form:
They are suitable for these abscesses, exits, fistulas, and boils because they go among the bones and other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and are made of brass, copper, iron, or silver. The best ones are made of brass.
And the explorers are made of black lead, which ensures that fistulas are opened in their concavity, and they reflect light due to their smoothness.
And they are of three kinds: some are long, others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Form of the large lead explorer:
Form of the medium lead explorer:
Form of the small lead explorer:
The forms of the hooks are of many kinds: some are simple, with only one curvature, and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And some are curved hooks, and they are of three kinds.
And some have two curvatures, and they are of three kinds.
And some have three curvatures, and they are of three kinds.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Form of the small simple hook, its form:
Form of the large hook with two curvatures: Form of the medium hook with two curvatures: Form of the small hook with two curvatures:
Form of the large hook with three curvatures:
Form of the medium hook with three curvatures:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Form of the large scalpel:
Form of the medium scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The ends of these, with which the cutting is done, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and are not placed in such a manner but for the assistance in the excoriation of nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve. This way, the patient is healed and finds some peace from the burning that happens during the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the almagidas, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of brass and are similar to the rod with which alcohol is made.
And it has a punctured end with a hidden blade, and it moves to the inside and outside parts as you wish, as you see.
The forms of the spatimis, which are hidden among the fingers for the perforation of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of the cupping glasses with which the blood flow is cut off, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small; their forms:
They are made of brass, round with some length, and they are thin.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be with you so that you can quickly stop the blood flow when needed, especially when medicine is not available to you at first.
However, do not use these to cut blood flow in every part of the body, only in fleshy places, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, the breasts, the belly, and the groins, similar to the moist fleshy muscles.
And sometimes these instruments are made smaller, resembling the peels of figs in this form, by which blood is stopped when phlebotomy is done, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this form:
Chapter 47.
On the treatment of men’s breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to the growth of hair as they begin to become hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and remain abscessed, distant.
And for those who have this, it is necessary to cut them with a lunar incision in this form, from line .B. to line .G., then scrape all the thickness, then fill the wound with healing medication, then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast sags downward and is softened due to its size, like that of women, then it should be split in two upper parts, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, each containing the other at the end, so that the larger line contains the smaller one in this form from line .B. to line .G. Then scrape the skin between the two lips of the wound, remove the fat, and apply what we said about stitching and powders necessary for the healing until it is cured.
And if you cannot complete the incision because of the patient's restlessness and the blood flow, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the perforation of abscesses that occur under the armpit.
These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the kind of scrofulas, hard, which contain a sack-like membrane.
And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar cut in this form: from line .G. to line .B. And when all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then the cotton is removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofulas, then you incise over it as we said in the section on scrofulas likewise.
But if the wound extends to where there is decay, then apply the cautery as we previously said.
Chapter 49.
On the incision of abscesses that occur due to an artery or a vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin over it is consolidated, then many times an abscess occurs. The signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or a vein: when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the body's depth; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sort of creaking.
And the one caused by a vein is round on the body's surface.
And incision on this abscess is an error, especially on those under the armpits, in the groins, on the neck, and in many places on the body; and it is very serious, so it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron, and the one that is on the extremities, or on the head, must be avoided.
But for the one caused by the swelling of the artery’s orifice, make an incision in the skin lengthwise; then open the incision with hooks and near the artery, and free it from the membranes until it is uncovered.
Then place a needle over it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, — a method I showed you in the extraction of two arteries in the temples.
Then press the place between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood is expelled, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then apply a treatment to where there is decay until the ligatures fall off; and then treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the skin, and then insert a needle below the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and it should have a double thread so you can pull it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature as I told you in the ligature of the uvula in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle under the whole abscess along the first needle’s incision, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is in it comes out, then you incise the excess skin, and leave what is tied.
Then place a powder on it that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then apply the treatment made with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 50 on the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and a vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when they are struck or due to excessive work, and for similar reasons.
And it occurs mostly in the places of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are affected.
And it is a severe abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is mostly in the large joints, and when it is pressed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness in it.
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the body's depth, and therefore it is under the skin, and it is affected all over and does not move forward or backward.
So those that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because it will very easily lead to contraction.
But the one that is on the head or the forehead, separate the skin with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it off from the roots.
And if it is large, then you lift it with a hook, scrape it, and then remove it; and join the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51:
On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to something that happens to the belly.
Many times it happens to some men in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, such lumps which are called fungal due to their resemblance to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head of it is large; and already the lips of them are inverted, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have already seen one, and in his belly there were two lumps which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between those white ones with small roots.
And already the lips of those were inverted and split, and moisture flowed from them all the time.
So I incised those and found in one a weight of almost 18 ounces and the other almost 6 ounces.
And the operation in their incision is that you consider if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white, moist, with subtle roots; then you incise it with a wide spatula, and in your presence, cauterize with fire, because many times after the incision a lot of blood is expelled; and if the blood comes, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and scared, avoid incision with iron; but then take newly made lead thread, and tie it around the lump, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
Then tighten the lead thread; do not stop tightening it more and more around the lump, until it is cut off and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the lump has large roots, then in its incision, there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in one that is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware not to attempt to incise a lump that is of dark color, with little feeling, and soft touch, because that one is likely cancerous.
And I will come to the memory of cancer near this.
Chapter 52:
On the treatment of umbilical eminence.
Umbilical eminence is caused by many factors; either by fissures of the diaphragm that is above the belly, and from it, the membrane or intestine comes out as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by confined wind in it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and the coming out of the membrane, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is smooth without pain, and it appears in various locations. And if it is due to the intestine coming out, then the location of it is more varied as we have described, and when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden, and then it returns; and it becomes very prominent after bathing and vigorous work.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is smooth and is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor increased.
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs, the abscess appears with a dark hue.
But if it is due to growing flesh, then it is a serious abscess, large and hard, and fixed to a certain extent.
But if it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.
And the operation on it is that you consider if the umbilical eminence is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or due to wind; then you should avoid treating it, as there is fear and dread in it, as I have explained in the chapter where I talked about abscesses from arteries and veins.
And if the umbilical eminence is due to the intestine or membrane, then instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie extended; then mark around the entire umbilicus with a probe, and instruct him to stand bent between your hands on his back, and then encircle the umbilicus with a wide spatula on the location you have marked with the probe; then extend half of the abscess to the upper parts with a large hook; and then tie around it with strong thread or silk in the proper manner of tying.
Then open the middle of the extended abscess over the binding and insert your finger into it and seek the intestine; and if you find and guard it by the binding, then carefully extract it and push the intestine back into the inner parts of the belly.
And if you find the membrane, then take it with a hook; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is contrary to you, an artery or vein, then circle around it, and return to your operation; and take two needles and insert strong threads in them and insert the two needles around the circuit you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, and make them penetrate; then tighten the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you want, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh decays and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thin and decayed, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the umbilical eminence is due to growing flesh or moisture, then you should hollow out the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or moisture you find in it, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments to solidify the place.
Chapter 53:
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already said, in the division, about the types of cancer and the manner of treating it with medicines, and that treatment with iron should be avoided so it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer engendered in the flesh and the precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cancer in the breasts or the thigh and their similar members, to extract all of it, especially when it is just starting small.
But when it is old and large, do not attempt to treat it, for I could not cure any of it nor have I seen another who could.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede and let the patient purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.
Then prepare the patient with preparation in which he is located for the operation, and then apply hooks where necessary; and then hollow out all around with a good cutting, ensuring no root cause remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument as possible.
But if the thick blood contradicts you by cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 54:
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And the one that is treated with iron is only the type of ascites, and iron is not used for the type of tympanites or the type of anasarca, for it is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment does not work, then consider, for if the patient has already acquired weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough or belly condition and similar to these, then avoid treating him with iron, for there is fear in that.
But if you see the patient with abundant strength, and he has no other illness but dropsy, and is not a child or elderly, then the manner of operation is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the assistant presses his belly with his hand, pushing the water to the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a sharp spatula in this shape:
let it be long with two sharp parts, with a sharp tip like a spatula; but it should have some small brevity, so that in operation with it you do not pass into the intestine and injure it.
Then consider if the dropsy is from the intestines, for then you should move your incision away from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, in the direction of the pubic region.
But if the dropsy is from a liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if it is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And do not make your incision on the side where the patient prefers to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then perforate the whole skin with the instrument, and insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin and the membrane, and peel it off; to the amount of a nail or around that.
Then perforate the membrane until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of the water. Then extract it and insert an instrument in this shape: it is similar to a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or brass or light bronze, at the lowest part of it there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and the tip of it is incised in the manner of a feather, as you sometimes see:
And at the uppermost end of it is a small ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, it then descends over the instrument, then evacuate the water in half the quantity at a time, for if you evacuate more than is appropriate at once, the patient may die quickly from a resolution of his animal spirit, or he may faint which approaches death.
But evacuate it according to the quantity of his strength and as the patient's pulse and condition indicate to you his strength and wellness.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water which is retained by the skin which closes the hole that you made on the membrane as described.
Then repeat the use of the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for a few days with caution, and avoid error until only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient, and you leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in the bath, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat him with desiccative medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, the spleen, and the liver near the water extraction site, as I have explained in the preceding section.
Chapter 55.
About the cure of children who are born with the urinary passage not perforated.
Sometimes some children are born from their mother’s womb and the tip of their urethra is not perforated (or the hole is narrow or not in the right place).
Then it is necessary to perforate it as soon as the child is born with a very fine spatula in this shape:
Then place a thin lead nail in the hole and tie it, and keep it there for three or four days.
And when the child wants to urinate, it should be removed and let him urinate; then reinsert it.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine that goes over the spot will not allow it to close.
But for the one whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for several days until it widens.
But those in which the hole is not in the right place, it means, in those cases, where the child is born and the hole is at the end of the tip of the penis so that he cannot urinate downward unless he lifts the penis with his hand upward; and this is not normal, because the sperm cannot reach the mother properly, and it is a serious illness.
And the way to operate is that the patient lies on his back, and then extend the tip of the penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the penis from the foreskin with a sharp spatula, like a feather incision, or shave off a part, so that the middle of it becomes like the tip of the penis and the hole falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful during your operation of the blood flow, because this often happens; and stop it with something that stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
About ulcers that occur on the foreskin and the tip of the penis, and about corruption, blackness, and adherence of the foreskin to the tip of the penis.
Often these ulcers occur on the penis and are a protrusion of soft flesh.
And among these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a thin hook and cut it off completely; then place a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant, of a blue color, then you should apply cautery to the incision site and its area.
But if the ulcer is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the ulcer inside first until it is consolidated; then treat the outside, because when you treat both the foreskin and the ulcer at the same time, it is not ensured that it will not tear.
And sometimes blackness and corruption occur on the genitals and foreskin, then you should scoop out all that is blackened and starting to corrupt or already corrupted; then spread honey on it, which is mixed with pomegranate peel flour and crushed and sieved roots.
And then treat it with other cures until it is healed.
But if there is a blood flow, then apply lunar cautery in this way:
because the cautery is helpful for both conditions at the same time, that is, for blood flow and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the tip of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adherence of the foreskin to the tip of the penis (and this adherence only happens to those whose foreskin is intact, and circumcision is not required; and when adherence happens due to a wound or abscess) you should peel it off with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the tip of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should peel off a part of the tip of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is very easily perforated due to its thinness.
Then separate between the foreskin and the tip of the penis with a thin blade, which has been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat it with a styptic wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
On the cleaning of children and the treatment of what happens to them after circumcision.
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: but since it is our procedure and our intention, and its use is mainly in children, it is necessary to assign the best operation and the easiest way to lead to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience, which is why I have found that most craftsmen and barbers use circumcision and cleaning with a razor and tweezers; and they use ligation with bile and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and found no better cleaning with scissors, ligation with bile than with nail cleaning, because often the upper layer escapes, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very quickly forced into another incision and sure pain. And with the cleaning done by wrapping, and it is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not ensured, because it very quickly goes into the hole.
But with the operation with the nail, you very quickly encounter iron and corrupt your operation. And the child’s foreskin is naturally short, and often it is born in such a way that it does not need cleaning, and I have seen this.
But from the cleaning done with scissors and ligation with bile, the quality, experience revealed to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and when you press with your hand, two sharp edges are proportionate, and you incise accordingly in one go; and the compression of the bile is made in a shape containing the foreskin of the penis in all parts, with which no error happens at all.
And the way of the first operation is that you make the child stand, especially if it is one who understands a little, so you only tie the bile on his penis and leave it until the next day.
Then make him happy in any way that is possible for you and that he understands. Then make him stand between your hands properly, and not be restless; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instruments.
Then put your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the tip of the penis comes out, and then clean it from any dirt that has accumulated on it.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be non-cutting and the other should be cutting, so that the ram does not come out of the nail, and the length of the two sharp edges should be equal to the length of the two handles.
But the error in cleaning is that the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, often escapes towards the incision.
So you need to stretch it from your time with your nail before the swelling of the area and incise it accordingly.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and the area under the penis remains swollen and festering, then leave it until the swelling subsides, and then peel it easily and incise it as you see fit.
And be careful of the tip of the penis, as this will not harm it.
And then treat it with what consolidates the wound from the powders we have mentioned in the treatise on powders.
And if the foreskin is incised beyond measure, and it reaches the upper parts, this does not harm it.
And then treat it with what we have mentioned until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is caused by an obstruction from a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or flesh, similar to what we have discussed in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has the following shape: It should be made of silver, thin, concave, like a bird’s quill with a fine long ray similar to a palm and a half in length, with a thin tube at its tip.
And the method for releasing urine with this is to take double bile and tie wool or cotton at its end for a good binding; insert the ends of the bile into the lower part of the syringe, and cut any excess wool with scissors, then insert it into the tube with force. Then wet the syringe with water and egg white.
Have the patient sit on a chair, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and rose water.
Then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the penis; fold the penis upwards towards the navel; push the syringe into it; and push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reaching the empty area, not following this order, but in a winding path.
Then extend the bile with the wool little by little, as the urine soaks into the wool.
Then extract it and make urine flow for treatment, using the syringe; continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder clysterization with a clampcedra and similar instruments that are suited for this.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or coagulated blood, or it is restricted by putrefaction, and you want to instill waters and medicines, then use an instrument called a clampcedra, which has the following shape:
It has a blind end, meaning it is closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, just like you sometimes see.
At the beginning, there is a concave place, in which what is pushed is, and it should be the right amount to fill it, without addition, so that when something is pulled from it, the moisture is drawn in, and when expelled, it is drawn with it, and when expelled far, just like the clampcedra with which naphtha is shot in naval battles.
So when you want to inject moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clampcedra into the moisture, and pull with it what is pushed to the upper parts, as the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
Then insert the end of the clampcedra into the penis as we have described with the syringe; then push the moisture with what you are pushing, as the moisture reaches the bladder quickly, and the patient feels it.
The shape of the fine clyster with which the bladder is clysterized, and this is its shape:
It should be made of silver or brass, with the top part resembling a small feather, and below it a tube inside a ligature.
Then take a bladder from a small animal, place in it the moisture you want to inject into the bladder, tie it between two points with a strong double ligature, and heat the moisture over a fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis.
Then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with firm pressure until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; perforate it around its circumference; then insert a strong bile into those holes, as it is rolled; then add the circle so that it is held like a stopper, after you place the moisture you want, and oils and waters in it.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of stones.
We have already discussed in the section the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stones that require manual operation and incision.
And the stone formed in the bladder is specifically the one that is lodged in the bladder.
And I am describing it here with clear explanation and brevity.
So, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly occur in children; and the signs of this are that the urine expelled from the bladder looks like water in its clarity, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, often feels pain, and then it becomes erect; and with this, there is pain in the rectum at times.
And it is easier to cure in children up to the age of fourteen; but it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young adults, the cure is intermediate because it is between these stages.
And in those cases where the stone is larger, the treatment is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
So, when we come to treat this, we must first cleanse the patient with a clyster to remove all filth from the bowels; because sometimes this filth prevents the stone from being discovered in the examination.
Then, the patient should be taken by the feet and shaken or moved downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes moves from a higher place.
Then have him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downward.
Then examine it thoroughly and completely from the outside.
So, if you feel the stone in the space, then proceed immediately with the incision.
And if you do not find it entirely by touch, then you should oil the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is an adult, and insert it into his rectum. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger and push it outward towards the place where you will make the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, lift the skin beneath the genitals towards the place where the incision will be made.
Then insert a well-made spatula, which has the following shape: and cut in the area between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle but towards the left thigh; the incision should be over the stone, with your finger in the rectum, and make a transverse cut so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size needed for the stone to pass through, and no more, because your finger in the rectum will press the stone towards the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones have angles and edges, making their expulsion difficult.
And some stones are smooth, resembling an acorn, and are round, making their expulsion easy.
So if it is one with angles and edges, adjust in the incision.
And if it is not expelled this way, you need to use force, or press on it properly with an instrument similar to a file, to press on the stone without slipping; or use a fine curved instrument from below.
But if you cannot manage it this way, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you see bleeding, stop it by applying crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, first push them towards the neck of the bladder, then cut over it; then push a little further; and do the same if there are many more than two.
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision, because one of two things will happen: either the patient will die or suffer from continuous urine leakage because the area cannot completely heal.
But try to expel it until it is out, or use forceps to break it into pieces and remove it.
So when you have completed the operation, fill the wound with a mixture of aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten it. And place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, to prevent swelling.
Then lay the patient on his back and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When you untie it, wash the area with water and oil, and then treat it with diafinicon and diabasilicon ointments until it is healed.
But if in the wound there is a hot, burning, and corrosive swelling, and if it seems like blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urine flow (this is known by the discharge of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood, because if it remains, it will cause the bladder to decay and rot.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with anything else that is suitable for healing it until it is healed.
And during the whole treatment period, you must bind both thighs and apply the medicines over the area.
And if the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, blocking urine flow, treat it as I described before attempting surgery, because sometimes this treatment alone can avoid surgery; and I have already tested this method, which involves using a perforating iron tool shaped like this:
With a triangular, sharp tip, set in a wooden handle.
Then take a string, and tie it around the penis below the stone so it does not return to the bladder.
Next, insert the iron tool into the penis, perforating easily until the tool reaches the stone. Then rotate the tool with your hand on the stone little by little, forcing the perforation until you penetrate the other side; the urine will be immediately released.
Then press your hand on the remaining part of the stone from outside the penis, because it will be broken and expelled with the urine, and the patient will be healed.
But if this treatment is not possible for some reason, then tie one string below the stone and another above it. Then make an incision over the stone in the penis between the two ties. Then extract the stone. Then untie the bindings and clean the congealed blood that has formed in the wound.
The binding below the stone is only necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the one above is needed because when the string is untied after the stone's extraction, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, it is necessary that when you tie the string above, you pull the skin upwards, so it covers the wound as we have described.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones in women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
But if a woman does develop stones, the treatment is difficult and hindered in many ways.
One reason is that a woman can easily become virgin again.
The second reason is that you rarely find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to a physician whether she is chaste or married.
The third reason is that you do not find many women who know this art, especially the manual operation.
The fourth reason is that the site for incision in women is far from the stone, requiring a deep incision, which is frightening.
But if necessity compels you to this, you must find a knowledgeable female physician, who is rare.
But if you lack one, seek a skilled and subtle midwife, or present a well-instructed matron in women's matters, or a woman who has recently learned this art.
Then bring her forward, and command her to do everything you instruct, starting with the investigation of the stone; if the woman is a virgin, she must put her finger in her anus and seek the stone.
If she finds it, she must hold it with her finger, and then you instruct her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone while placing her left hand on the bladder, pressing firmly.
If she finds it, she must carefully move it from the bladder opening downward with the utmost care until it reaches the root of the thigh.
Then make an incision at the middle of the vagina near the root of the thigh on whichever side the stone is located, and the finger must not be removed from the stone, holding it below.
The incision should be small at first; then insert the probe into the incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the size needed to extract the stone.
And know that there are many types of stones: some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and with branches.
So you should know the types to determine the best approach.
If you see blood flow, apply powdered vitriol to the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume the operation until the stone is extracted.
Prepare the instruments mentioned for extracting stones in men, to assist you in the operation.
If you see blood flow, and know that it is from the artery being cut, then apply powder to the area and tighten it with bandages and pressure, do not repeat it; leave the stone and do not extract it, as the patient may die. Then treat the wound.
When the bleeding has stopped after a few days, and the area has healed, you can return to the operation until the stone is extracted.
Chapter 62.
On the section about watery hernia.
Watery hernia is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is under the covering of the genitals containing the testicle, and it is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane that nature prepared in the testicle area, making it appear as though there is another testicle; and it is the genital covering between the white sac we mentioned, and it is merely solid matter.
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness occurring in the genitals, causing this material to accumulate there, and sometimes it occurs from a blow to the genitals.
This moisture has many colors, either yellowish, blood-like, red, black and foul, or watery white, which is the most common.
The signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: if it is in the white sac, the swelling is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the genitals appear so because the moisture surrounds it entirely.
If the moisture is in the membrane itself, the swelling is round with part of the testicle, and thus it is thought to be another testicle.
If the moisture is between the genital covering and the white sac, it falls below the perception.
When you want to determine the color of the moisture, you test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a square probe; and based on what comes out in the mark from the probe, you judge what is inside.
When we come to treating it with surgery, we should instruct the patient to be bled if possible, and cleanse his body fully.
Then let him lie on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and place many cloths under him.
Sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to be on his right side, who will extend his penis to one of two sides to the covering of the genitals and the lower part of the abdomen.
Then take a broad knife and cut the genital covering in the middle along its length down to near the pubic bone.
The incision should be made straight and equally distant from the line dividing the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white sac.
Expose it, and be careful not to cut it; your exposure of it should be done delicately, suspending the testicle more and carefully inspecting it according to the amount possible.
Then perforate the water-filled sac with a wide opening and extract all the water.
Separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sac to the upper parts; do not touch the covering of the genitals, and cut the sac as much as possible. Cut it entirely or in pieces, especially its delicate side, because if you do not carefully cut it, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the testicle comes out of its covering during your operation, once you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the genital covering with sutures, and treat it like any other wound until it heals.
If you find the testicle is corrupted by another disease, you must tie the vessels on the suspensory cord, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously mentioned.
If the water is accumulated in two separate parts, know that there are two hernias; make the incision in that part as you did in the other; if it appears to be a single operation, then do it.
Then cleanse the blood, and place wool soaked in oil or rose oil in the incisions; place other wool soaked in wine and oil outside, spread it over the two genitals and the lower abdomen; place folded cloths and powders on top, and bind them with a bandage in this manner:
Take two cloths and fill them with carded wool as follows; make ends of cotton or damp wool, attach them with a structure in the breech of the trousers, one end from the bottom to the back, the second end to the lower part of the abdomen, two ends over the thighs below, and two other ends over the groins, and adjust the whole structure in the breech of the trousers.
Sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of surgical cutting; take a subtle knife-like cautery and incise the covering of the genitals, ignite it as we have described until the white sac containing the water is exposed, then take the cautery in this shape: It is shaped like a Greek letter.
Then pierce the sac with it, ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
Extend the sac with hooks, and expose it with hooks, and expose it with a subtle ignited cautery; cut it as much as possible until you eradicate everything; take care not to let the fire touch the testicle.
Know that this operation is safer and less prone to blood flow, and better than surgery with cutting.
But if a hot swelling opposes you during the cutting or cautery operation, or if there is a flow of blood, you must treat the opposition accordingly, with the treatment appropriate for it as mentioned.
But if the patient is fearful and does not endure the second operation due to its horror, administer a perforation as I describe here; this is when it is confirmed by you, from what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.
Then have the patient sit on an elevated seat, pierce the swelling at its lowest part with a broad knife, and make the perforation along the length of the body.
The opening should be wide enough to drain all the water.
Then place cotton over the area, bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains. Then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the drainage of the water when you pierce it, this is because the white membrane in the wound opening opposes and prevents the exit of the water, you must insert a plug or instrument used to extract water from dropsy, as previously described; or adjust a small instrument in the wound opening.
Know that the water returns, and it is accumulated around six months or thereabouts; when it is accumulated, pierce it in the same manner, as the patient will thus live out his days.
Chapter 63.
On the section about fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the section on this hernia, there is fear leading to ruin in major cases; therefore, I find that abandoning it and being saved from it is better.
I am recalling the operation on it and the types of swellings.
I say that the swellings occur in bodies whose genitals are affected and this happens for many reasons: either by an acute sour excess, which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
The color of the swelling matches the body color, and it is not painful, but it is a serious swelling.
Often the swelling becomes stone-like, its color is dark, and it has no sensation.
Sometimes it occurs by blockage of the arteries, and by swelling of them as has already been mentioned, or by swelling of veins.
What is caused by swelling of arteries is known by the dispersal of the swelling when you press it with your fingers; it should not be touched.
What is caused by swelling of veins is not dispersed at all by compression with fingers.
It is possible to make an incision on this type and on other fleshy parts; you must cut the genital covering, extend the testicle to the upper parts, remove it from the white sac, free the suspensory cord from the vessels, tie them, and cut the suspensory cord as you free it from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is consolidated with those fleshy parts, you must remove and cut it.
If there is adhesion to any part of the sac, or to the vessels, you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have said.
When your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hernia caused by veins.
Vein swelling is a swelling surrounded by a wrap similar to a shoot with softening of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
Treating this illness is feared because of the previously mentioned reasons.
However, we must describe the operation on it as the first did.
I say that you should have the patient sit on an elevated seat; push the testicular suspensory to the lower parts; hold the genital covering with your fingers along with the vessels attached to the penis; another assistant should hold and stretch them vehemently.
Then cut with a sharp broad knife transversely over the vessels until they are exposed.
Expose all parts as we have described for artery extraction in the temples.
Insert a needle with a double thread into them, tie it at the first place where the vein problem occurs, and tie it again at the end of them. Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated of fetid and corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound as you would other wounds where you want healing to be produced, so that the vessels nourishing one of the two testicles fall off, for there is no harm in this.
But if the vein problem affects all the vessels, the testicles must be removed or the testicles and vessels should be closed off, depriving them of all nourishment through vessel incision, and they should be atrophied, or closed off so they are not beneficial.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear that happens in the sac extended over the abdomen from the parts of the inguinal regions, causing the intestines to descend through that rupture to some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the sac or its extension, and these two types occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting something heavy, or similar.
The sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the sac, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and it is a swelling similar to a tumor because the sac compresses the intestine.
The sign of it is when it is due to a tear in the sac, because initially it causes sudden intense pain; and it is a different swelling apparent below the surface, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, with its body outside the sac.
Sometimes the membrane is pushed out with the intestine, and this is called an intestinal hernia with a membrane.
Sometimes it is formed with gas, and sometimes it runs into the crack of the intestine, where it is retained, causing great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of this disease with iron there is fear, so it must be avoided.
And the way to perform the operation is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back with his hand into its cavity if it responds to its return, then he should be inverted over his neck between your hands, and you raise his legs.
Then stretch the covering that encloses the testicles to the upper parts, and cut the covering of the testicles lengthwise; then place hooks in the two edges of the incision as you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision is according to the size that it is possible for you that from there the testicle is pushed out.
Then peel off that sac which is below the covering of the testicles, until the hard white sac is exposed on each side.
Then insert your finger into what encloses the testicle, into what is between the white sac, which is below the covering of the testicle, and between the second sac, and release with it the adhesion that is on the back of the testicle.
Then move the covering of the testicles to the outside with your hand, and with that stretch the white sac upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the sac to the incision site; instruct your assistant to stretch the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with complete separation.
And check with your fingers that there is no part of the intestine wrapped in the hard white sac. But if you find any part of it, then push it back to the abdomen below.
Then cut the part below the covering of the testicles with an incision from which blood and healing fluid will flow as we have described before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the binding we mentioned (and sometimes the white sac is cauterized, as we have said near the incision to prevent blood flow, because this often happens) and leave the binding until it falls off by itself.
But if its removal is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water and placed on it until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with other wound care until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On windy hernia.
In this hernia, no one has been seen to be daring enough to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have described in the hernia with life; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision over it easily; then dry the area around the swelling with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the place swells.
And it does not leave any cause from the intestines to the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns at all times.
But if time is prolonged with this, a fissure is formed in the sac in which the intestine descends into the sac; and this happens because of the extension of the sac that is in the groin as we have said, which causes the sac to be stretched, and then it becomes softened and the place is swollen and enlarged.
And the treatment of it is with cautery as previously described.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and the patient lies on his back between your hands, then dry the place of the rupture from the swelling with an incision across it according to the width of three fingers.
Then stretch the white sac that is under the covering until it is exposed.
Then take a rod and place it on the swollen area of the sac, and press it to the belly button.
Then sew the two swollen areas over the end of the rod of the sac, and join them with the suture.
Then remove the end of the rod, and do not cut the sac completely, nor extend the testicle, nor any other part as I let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with wound care, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the sac is contracted and the rupture is not swollen.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
On the softening of the covering of the testicles.
Sometimes the covering of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between it is softened, and its care is unpleasant.
Then it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the covering that is softened over the natural covering; then join the two edges with the suture.
And if you want, sew at the beginning the excess of the softened covering with three or four stitches and a firm suture.
Then cut between the sutures; and then treat it as with other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall off.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
You should know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it is allowed for me to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only for two reasons, one is so that it is in the knowledge of the doctor when asked about it, that he knows the treatment for the one it happens to; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
So I say that castration is done in two ways: either by attrition, or by incision and cutting.
But in the one that is done by attrition, the way of the operation is that we make the animal sit in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. Then take them in your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
But in castration done by incision and cutting, you need to hold the animal and press the covering of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory, and cut over each testicle with an incision until both testicles protrude.
Then cut those more that you have exposed. And do not leave any part of the sac on them, except the subtle sac that is over the bases.
And this manner of castration is better than the one done by attrition, because strong attrition leaves some part of the testicles that causes the animal to desire mating.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: one is when it appears in the space in the covering of the testicles, in that between the two testicles there is a figure like a female vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes from it flows urine which is in the covering of the testicles.
But in women it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man a little extending outward like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is that you need to cut those attached flesh until the appearance of it is removed, then treat them with wound care.
And in the second type in men from which urine flows that is in the covering of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.
Chapter 71.
On lentigo and protruding flesh from causes in women.
Lentigo is often joined to natural causes when it is stressed and made the target of attention; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to the extent that it spreads like in men and becomes involved in intercourse.
Then you need to hold the excess of lentigo with your hand or with a hook and cut it.
And do not delay in cutting, especially at the base of the root, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.
Then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
But new flesh is flesh that grows in the orifice of the mother until it fills it, and often it is expelled to the outside in the form of a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed disease"); so we need to cut it as we cut lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of imperforate hymen.
Alratica is when the vulva of the woman is not perforated or the opening is very small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and it is caused either by flesh grown together or by a thin or thick membrane.
And it happens either at the base of the vagina, or on its sides, or at its top, or at its bottom, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and often stops menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by the observation of the midwife if the blockage is apparent and near; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a rod.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and it is near the two labia, then you cut it and break it.
And it is that you place on the two labia some powder, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then extend the two labia with force until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot, and lie with a man that day so that the cut place does not heal.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you need to cut it with a broad spatula or a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to grown flesh, then lift it with a hook, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop the flow of blood without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a broad lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.
And keep it for some days and administer dry calk.
Then treat it with other wound care until it is healed.
And sometimes there is a birth of other flesh in the vagina, and then you need to cut it in this manner. But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, no treatment with iron should be done to the cancerous abscess in the vagina in any way.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and warts and red swelling that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are seen at the openings of many veins from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, warts are formed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will also say which of these can be treated and which cannot be treated.
So I say that hemorrhoids and warts when they are at the base of the vagina and are not felt, then no treatment with iron should be done for those.
But those which are in the opening of the vagina and are felt, those are the ones that are treated.
And you need to place the woman in a warm bath and then extend the hemorrhoid with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them at the roots.
Then sprinkle on them some of the powders that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia and similar ones.
Then bind her feet together for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and galls and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with it over the back of the area.
And if the bleeding stops, it is good; if not, use two cupping glasses, and on the breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or nightshade juice or rockrose juice with sour wine and apply it to the place; then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
On perforation of accidental abscess in the vagina.
Many types of abscesses occur in the vagina, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, swollen tissues, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, cracks, warts, and other abscesses. And I have already mentioned these diseases and their types and their signs, and their treatments in the division.
And I need to say in this treatise about the hot abscess which comes in the vagina when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you want to know in what manner the operation of it is done with iron.
Then you need to consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and if you see it redden and if it is felt, then do not hurry with its perforation, and treat it with what helps with maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms stops.
And then you need to make the woman sit on a chair that has two seats; and recline on her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of the abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a band to something convenient.
Then the midwife stands on the right side and administers the instrument with which the vaginal opening is opened, the shape of which will be shown in those cases that will be performed next.
And when you want to use this instrument, you need to place the base of the vagina of the woman with the rod, and what is inserted from the instrument into the vagina should not be more than the base of the vagina and harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the base of the vagina, then you need to place powders on the tissue of the base of the vagina so that the entrance of any instrument into the base of the vagina is prevented.
And you need to place the screw that runs in the instrument from the top side and the administrator holds the instrument and turns the screw until the vaginal opening is open.
And when the abscess appears, and it is felt by the hand and is smooth and soft, then you need to cut it from its head with a broad spatula.
And when the pus is evacuated, then you need to place in the wound a swab soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the swab in the section in the base of the vagina.
And place outside the vagina and on the pubis clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it for two days with ointment that is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the vagina and the wound are washed so that it is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia is boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the vagina and hidden, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, but treat it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives in what manner the live embryos are treated when they come out in an unnatural position.
It is necessary that the midwife knows at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth by its signs, and when you see the woman exerting pressure on her lower parts and wanting to breathe the air, and then she is relieved by the pressure of the childbirth, and hastens the emergence of the embryo, then know that this birth is according to the natural position, and it is the emergence of the baby on its head, and the placenta with it or hanging or suspended from the umbilical cord.
So when you see these signs, you need to compress the belly so that the embryo descends gently because when it descends on its head, it descends with the placenta, and it is cleaned of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But the one that is different from this birth is unnatural and not praiseworthy, because when the embryo comes out on its feet and its body comes out before its head and its feet, and one of its hands, or on its foot, or its head and its hand come out, or its belly, and it is very easily twisted on its neck, and such shapes are not praiseworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these cases and to avoid error and deception.
And I am showing each figure of these, and what tool is used in them so that it is indicated by this and it is established accordingly.
When the baby comes out on its head by natural expulsion, and this is strong on the woman and makes the birth difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then make her sit, or the women hold her, and vaporize her vagina with boiled fenugreek and moist oils.
And then the midwife inserts between her fingers a small spatula and cuts with it the placenta, or cuts it with her nail until the moisture within it flows out. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman needs to be anointed with a mucilage of psyllium and fenugreek with sesame.
And then instruct her, near the anointing, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a condition; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, because the fetus will be expelled quickly.
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you need to reduce them easily little by little. But if it does not respond to insertion, then place the woman on a chair and lift her feet up, and then shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall due to the shaking.
And if the hands are not turned inside and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus or tie its body to the hand with a cloth and extract it with equal force, because it will be expelled.
When the fetus comes out on its feet, then you need to push them up, and then turn the fetus gently, and then straighten it, and then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
But when it is out to the thighs, then you instruct her to exert pressure, and make her sneeze with a condition, because it will be expelled if God wills.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in the natural position, because then it will be expelled with an easy emergence.
And if it is prohibited with all that we have recommended, then take mucilage of mallow and dissolved gum, and pound it all in a mortar with good pounding, and then anoint the woman’s vagina and the lower part of her belly with it. And then make her sit in warm water, until it reaches her hypochondria.
And when you see that her lower parts are softened, then make her inhale the smoke of myrtle and place her over it. And when she has inhaled the smoke for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and stretch her mouth, and lift her from it, and press the lower part of her belly with light compression, because the fetus will be quickly expelled.
Emergence of the fetus laterally with one of its hands hanging. It needs to be handled by reducing the hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with strong shaking, and then administer the mucilages I have mentioned.
And if the childbirth comes, then make her sit on a chair, and then study the reduction of the hand, and straighten the fetus according to the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to exert pressure until it is expelled.
Emergence of the fetus on its neck with its hands spread and its face to its mother’s back. The midwife needs to hold the fetus's hand and then turn it little by little, and align it easily.
And when it is aligned, then place on her vagina what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to move little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side, and then instruct her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with a condition. Exit of the fetus prepared on its side.
When it descends to the horror of the mother in this manner, consider, and then you cut the placenta with your nail until the moisture is evacuated.
And if the fetus is suspended on its face and neck, then you cut it from the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus inside until you place it as needed, and instruct the woman to exert pressure a few times, and it will be expelled with easy emergence, if God wills.
Exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and seldom happens; but sometimes they are born by nature, and not alive.
And count them, even if they are multiplied, with one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them by the ligament in the umbilical cord of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled just like a fetus with easy natural emergence, and sometimes they are expelled with an unnatural emergence as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and come to what we have said about the unnatural figures, then you treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is subtle and does this with ease and subtlety, and with delay, and is skilled in every figure as it is prepared with the skill bringing health.
Remembrance of what is formed in the womb from embryos and aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that a woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten all formed, which was done by the measurement of the glorious sages.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife because very soon she will encounter such a case, and therefore she should act accordingly with what is appropriate.
Chapter 76
On extracting the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have discussed in the section on medication and it has not come out, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of healthy constitution and not afflicted with any conditions that could lead to her demise.
Then, the woman must be laid on her back on the bed, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs elevated.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Then, you should moisten the mother's genital area with humid oils and mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Next, the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, searching with her hand for a place to hook onto the fetus.
And appropriate places for this are: if the fetus is positioned to come out head first, then you should hook into its eyes, or the neck, or the mouth, or the palate, or under the chin, or in the collarbone area, or in the spaces near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if it is positioned feet first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And you must hold the hook with your right hand, place the curved part of it between the fingers of your left hand, and gently insert your hand and place the hook in one of those mentioned locations until you reach the empty cause.
And then place and fix another hook, or a third if needed, so that the traction is equal and not just in one direction.
Rather, it should be pulled in all directions, so that its extraction is eased, just as it is done when removing a tooth from its socket.
It is necessary that the stretching is softened; and if any part of it is retained, the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and gently insert them to loosen the retained part.
Then, if a part of the fetus is removed, the hooks should be moved to a higher place; and do this until the whole fetus is removed.
But if one hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its tightness, then cloth should be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is completely removed, and cut it either at the wrist or the elbow.
And you must do the same with the other hand and the two feet.
But if the fetus's head is large, or if it is constricted in the delivery, or if there is water in its head, then you must insert between the fingers a pointed spatula and pierce the head to extract the water, or use an instrument called “alundat,” whose shape will be described along with other instruments in the chapter near this one.
And do similarly if the fetus has a naturally large head: then you must cut it with a knife, or take it with the alunda as we have mentioned; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has come out but is constricted at the clavicle, then it should be cut until the moisture in the chest is released.
But if it is not complicated, nor responding to extraction, then you should cut the head as soon as possible as you are able.
And if the lower abdomen is abscessed or has dropsy, then you must pierce it so that the moisture inside can flow out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its traction is light and its direction to the mother's mouth is light.
But if it is constricted around the belly and chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut the belly and chest until what is inside flows out.
But if the other limbs are out and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then insert the hand into the throat, search for the head, and pull it with the fingers to the mother's mouth, then insert a hook, or two hooks, and pull it out with them.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by an abscess that occurred, then it must not be worked on; instead, moist and fatty remedies should be administered. And apply plasters; and have the patient follow a regimen of baths that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and follow what we have said for a live fetus.
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that no part of the placenta is left inside.
And when you have completed all your operations, then administer what we have said about treating the abscesses that occur in the mother.
And if there is a flow of blood, then have her sit in astringent baths and administer other treatments.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and then she became pregnant again, and the fetus died again. It happened to her after a long time an abscess in her navel; and it swelled until it opened, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat it, and treated it for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied to it some strong drawing plasters, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was greatly amazed, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Then I treated the wound, and extracted many bones from it, with the woman being in better condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, discharging a little pus.
And I do not consider this strange, but rather see it as knowledge and help in what the skilled physician can administer by hand for healing.
On the forms of the instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of the screw with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of the screw in which the books are joined, in which there are two screws at the ends of two rods. However, this screw must be more delicate in structure, and be made of ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each rod should be about two fingers, and the edge of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two rods are two joints of the same wood that are already fixed, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions should be inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she can be opened with them when you turn the two prescribed screws.
Another similar form, more delicate and lighter:
Should be made of ebony or boxwood in the likeness of forceps. But at the end of it, there are two additions as usual, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging, exposing what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors equally according to the amount you want of the opening of the mother until the midwife does what you want.
The form of the screw that the ancients called:
Form of the pusher with which the fetus is pushed:
Form of the crusher with which the large head is crushed
And it is similar to forceps which have teeth at the end, as usual, and sometimes it is made long like forceps in this shape, as usual, which have teeth like saw teeth with which it is cut and crushed. Form of a small crusher:
Form of a hook with one spine:
Form of a hook with two spines:
Form of a spatula with two ends with which the head is cut off:
Form of two wide spatulas:
All these instruments are exercised, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier their operation and the more valuable they become for men.
And you do not work with those instruments unless you are well-prepared, because the necessity of them is inescapable.
On the extraction of the placenta.
When the placenta is retained after childbirth, you must command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze in a certain way, and press your hand on her mouth and nose, and if it comes out with that, good.
If not, then take a pot and make a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the mother, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, arabic gum, cassia, and centaury. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the pot, and place it on the fire.
Then place a reed tube in the mouth of the mother, and hold it until the steam comes into the cavity of the mother.
Then make her sneeze as we have said, and the placenta will be quickly expelled.
But if it remains after this treatment and has not come out, then command the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta, and when she has found it, then take it and extend it little by little. But if it is attached to the throat of the mother, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the placenta, extract it little by little in a straight manner so that the mother does not fall due to the strong pulling. First, it is necessary to move her to the right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and the pot with herbs.
But if it is not expelled with all the methods we have described, then be careful not to strain her by repeated attempts at extraction, but rather what has come out to the mother's mouth should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then coat it with ointment and tetrapharmacum; because that will make it rot in a few days, and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it rots, a bad smell rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then it is necessary to administer fumigations and other suitable treatments.
But some of the Ancients have already tried fumigations with assafoetida and dried figs.
Form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the placenta:
Should be made of glass or brass.
And the narrow end should be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the coals of the fire.
And keep it until the fumigation is consumed and then repeat with another.
On the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which have a thin and obstructed membrane. Then the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And if obstruction of the anus occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then that consolidation should be incised, and then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that occur below.
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are characterized by swelling and thickness, which occur near the anus externally or in the space of one side.
And it can be a single fistula or multiple ones.
And when that swelling is old and discharges a watery white fluid or subtle decay, sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating fistulas are known by what exits from them through discharge and wind; and sometimes the patient has discharge, and often worms exit from them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space of the bladder, and into the urethra; and some penetrate into the junction of the thigh and into the coccyx.
And what is known as a penetrating fistula into the anus and non-penetrating is that you place your index finger into the anus, and insert a slender probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it is not tortuous.
But if it is tortuous, then insert a slender probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all nor is there any discharge of excrement, worms, or wind from the hole, as we have said, then you know it is non-penetrating, and then proceed to treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of it is the exit of urine from it and the prevention of consolidation of the area with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the junction of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the area, then the sign of it is that the probe reaches there if it is not tortuous into the bone, and causes pain in the area; and it constantly discharges pus; and no medication is effective, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of them is work and vanity of the many doctors on whom they rely.
But in those that are non-penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected as I will explain to you, and what I have already tried.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs upwards, his thighs inclined to his abdomen, and then insert a lead probe, or a brass one if the fistula is tortuous, until you know the place where the probe reaches.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then you need to insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe on your finger already exposed penetrating by itself, other than what you feel between your finger and it being tissue or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But some might say that it heals in some men late.
And of the treatment by which help is expected is that you use a slender cautery according to the width of the fistula, as described earlier, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fistulous tissues that are like the shaft of a bird's feather are burned.
And then treat it with bandages soaked in vinegar until all those burnt tissues fall off, and then treat it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate into your finger which is in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and sometimes the fistula is at the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you cut with the probe, and be in the fistula until the cut reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and by the probe, it is freed and falls.
And then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are like the shaft of a bird's feather and ensure no cause remains from them.
But if a flow of blood comes between you and your operation when you cut those tissues, then the best thing and the lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, because cautery with fire has two good effects: it burns those adjusted tissues, and stops the blood and dries the moisture.
And then treat it with bandages soaked in vinegar or in crushed things until the place produces scabs, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these are medicines that have astringency and drying; when it is restored, it is already healed and do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula already reaches into the anus and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.
And if you then feel the probe and between you and it there is a layer of tissue or flesh, and it is near penetration, then there is no operation in it except by a method of trust and hope.
The treatment involves one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach the cavity of it so that it is possible for you to insert the necessary tools and the proper treatment; and do not proceed much with cutting so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and cause the patient to have involuntary discharge; and then treat it as we have said because it will heal very quickly; or extend that layer and cleanse that pus by cutting it near the anus, as we have said, with a probe or another sharp instrument, and then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are in the cut until you can remove them; and then try to restore the entire wound with cutting, and if the upper opening is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is ended in this way: it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and at the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for sewing leather according to this form:
and insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads or around those; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach the cavity of it.
But if it is penetrating into the edge of the anus near inside, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and then when you cut more into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues that are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is much in the anus, for you must not do it so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of a spatum spinos with which the fistula is cut: its curve is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of them.
Hemorrhoids are in two ways, for they are either between the anus looking like coals, or as if they are like clusters of grapes. And of those some are small and some large, and blood flows from them continuously and some are single, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its edges.
But those that are outside the anus are mostly due to little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with continuous discomfort, and according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you quickly suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail, and then cut them towards their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool blanket, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterizing. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not respond to evacuation, then use a small biting enema on the patient, and wash with it what is in the anus so that it responds to evacuation lightly when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the treatment of them is easier, and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them, and then treat them as we have said until they are healed.
And for the one who dislikes incision, you should administer suturing of them in this manner: take a thread wrapped and insert it into a needle and then extract the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and this transversely; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tie, and then knot the thread and extract the needle.
And do this to all, and leave one of them and do not sew it, so that the excess blood runs from it.
And then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or plaster; and place it over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls; and when it has fallen, treat it with ointments or with other treatment until it is healed.
And when they are old and do not heal with that medicine, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or with your nail until they are made moist and remove the uppermost scab, which prevents them from healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you remove them more vigorously than the first time until much blood flows and they are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that "alamermar" is a corn, and it is nothing but a round knot resembling the color of the body and similar to the head of a nail, and it is formed on the whole body but mostly on the parts below the feet and the toes, and it causes pain in those areas.
Then you must incise around the corn, hold it with scissors or a hook, and remove it from its root; and then treat it.
And if you want, cauterize it as described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round prominence on the surface of the body, and often appears on children's hands.
And its treatment is to stretch and incise it, or to bind it with thread or skin until it falls off. And if you want, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But "formica" is a small, felt-like or large fistulated prominence on the surface of the body, moving a lot in the flesh, and when it is touched, it feels like an ant bite, and it is formed around the body.
And its treatment is to take a tube made of goose feather or vulture feather, and make it strong, and place it over the "formica" so that it contains the circle of the tube around it; then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the "formica," and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the "formica" from its root.
And if you want, do this with a brass or iron tube in this way:
The upper part of the tube should be narrowed, closed (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the handling of it with the finger is facilitated and its rotation is smooth.
And if you want, cauterize the "formica" as previously described in the chapter on cauterization of atheyl.
On the form of the instruments used to administer enemas.
Sometimes enemas are made of silver or brass or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those to whom they are administered, because those used for treating small children should be small; and for those whose anuses are delicate or painful, their enemas should be small.
The form of a large and small enema:
The top of the tube to which the bag is attached should be wide in this manner; and it should be at the place where the bag is tied, as usual.
And the lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed (that is, not open) and very smooth, narrowing to a fine point; and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the roots and a little thicker.
And the bag in which the medicines are placed should be made of animal bladder or sheep skin, and its root should be a palm in length.
And it should be perforated with many holes as it is wrapped; and the space between the holes should be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong bile of raw bile, which should be from ten gallbladders, or around them; and attach the bag to it; and when the bag is placed on it, it should be tightened at the top of the enema tube with strong constriction between two markings, and then administer the enema through each hole: But the quality of administering the enema with it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a pillow or sheet under them; then anoint the end of the enema tube with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; then insert it into the anus easily, and the administrator should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands with force until everything in the enema tube is evacuated into the intestine; then remove the enema tube and the patient should lift their legs against the wall.
And if the medicine forces a bowel movement, the patient should hold it in as long as possible; and if they sleep with it for the whole night, it is even better for the treatment.
But if you administer the enema in cases of diarrhea and its exit causes burning, then you should repeat the enema until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the enema tube should be very smooth and narrow, like the enemas used for children.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already mentioned in the section on the treatment of wounds what is suitable for the book, and now I will describe the treatment of those with manual techniques and medicines according to the procedure.
So I say that the wounds are varied according to what causes them and according to the location on the body where the wounds occur.
And the causes for which many times wounds are made are such as the throwing of stones, or incision by sword or knife, or striking with a spear, or with sticks, or with arrows, or similar to those from many causes.
But the wounds that are on the parts of the body are such as a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will start with the simple wounds of the head, for the consideration of the complex ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from the throwing of a stone or something similar, and it has only cracked the skin and is a large wound, and you fear for the patient the occurrence of a hot abscess, then promptly perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein, and do not delay; and extract from the patient the blood according to the strength of the person unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and the patient should avoid repletion, wine, and heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let the patient reduce their food intake and avoid meat and wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil or in wine in which there is astringent.
But if you are sure of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its blood and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will mention shortly.
And if the air has already altered it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or is by incision of a sword and the like, and the lips of it are not joined by powders, then join them with sutures as I will describe for their suturing.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no other retention but a small suspension, then incise it and treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh next to the skin, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that are heavy: heads and cooked forms and similar to them, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow, and it is not stopped by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find it not incised, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity forces you that what we have said does not suffice, then cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is minor; so you sprinkle on them this powder, so that they are healed before the air changes them.
And the method of the powder is this: take one part oil of mastic, two parts dragon's blood, three parts unslaked lime; let all be very finely ground and sifted, and let the wound be filled with it, and be compressed with good compression until it adheres well to it, and be coagulated with the blood.
And then compress it on top with powders and leave it, and do not untie it while it is thus until it is not abscessed, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes do this only cautiously, when you do not have mastic and dragon's blood present.
And always do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they be compressed, and these are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially when it is in summer, then it is not appropriate to apply this powder, but instead treat them with what we have mentioned, so that you place on them some digestible ointments, or you place on them powders of barley flour with water and honey until they remove the rottenness; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if with the wound a fracture of the bone occurs, and it is small, then extract it with gesture.
And I will tell the cure of fractures of the head in what is to come.
From the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple wound on the head.
But if the nerve or artery in the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, do not use astringent agents like zinc and alum, as they are harmful to the nerves and can cause contraction. Do not apply any cold substance to the wound, as the nature of the nerves is cold, and they are connected to the brain, which is the highest of all organs.
And treat the wound with light medicines, such as washing it with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or not, and then washing it again with fresh water and applying moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or close its edges, and treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or occurs in a decaying area, then perforate it at the lowest part.
But if an artery is cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the throat or neck are cut and the veins of the neck are saved, then align the edges of the wound with sutures over the throat and do not touch it; first, align and reduce it to its natural shape, then secure it properly, and leave it for a few days; then treat it with ointments that have astringent and stimulating properties until it heals.
But if the wound in the bone has caused damage, then treat it, and if there are bone fragments, remove all that you can; and leave what you cannot remove until the wound decays, and it can be separated and the removal is easier.
And if the wound is recent, then apply the recommended powder to it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what is described in its chapter.
If it is a strike from a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider if air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its blood, then apply the powder from the first hour, and do not compress it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive ointment and loosen it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then place old cotton in the wound's opening to absorb the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is inside runs out.
But if three days or more have passed and the patient has not experienced spasms or bad heart tremors or breathing difficulties, and other good conditions are observed, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with poultices and other treatments until it heals.
But if its healing is delayed and it remains open all the time, then know that a fistula has formed; treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what is mentioned for sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if damage to the bone has occurred and pieces are cut off, then twist the wound and quickly remove those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound decays, making their extraction easier.
And for other wounds occurring in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the same as what we have said.
From the wounds of the abdomen.
The condition that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or moderate.
Small disruptions are difficult to manage in another way, and so their reduction is more difficult if you do not promptly return them to their place, as they can swell and thicken, making repositioning difficult.
Thus, a moderate disruption is best, as it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, unlike in the other two types mentioned before.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen follows four methods, but two sutures are common and suitable for other body wounds.
And two other sutures are specific to abdominal wounds, but they can also apply to other wounds.
And I will explain each one to you in detail.
So I say that when the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes and is difficult to reduce, it is due to either the smallness of the disruption, as we have said, or when the intestine has become swollen from the cold air.
And when this happens, you must warm it by soaking a sponge or cloth in warm water alone or boiling it with skink, cypress, and spikenard, and apply it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.
Sometimes, use a solution with astringent properties, which is better than plain water for reducing the swelling.
And when you see the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been boiled, as this eases its repositioning with little effort.
But if repositioning is still difficult with this treatment, then slightly enlarge the disruption with an instrument used for incising hemorrhoids.
The primary treatment is better when it is proper and not just an incision, and it should not involve drying out unless necessary.
About the instrument, according to its shape:
One part of it is sharp and curved, and the other part is not sharp, with a fine point, but not as thin as a needle, rather slightly blunt.
When the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, it must be returned to its natural form in its proper place, if possible, as this is better.
But when the disruption is large and in the lower part of the abdomen, make the patient lie on their back with their legs higher than their head; if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, place the patient's head and chest higher than the lower parts.
Similarly, if the disruption is on one side of the abdomen, always ensure that the part with the wound is higher than the other.
And so you should administer this for large and moderate wounds.
For small wounds, use what you have prepared, and ensure the assistant is compassionate, holding the disruption with their hand, adjusting the edges, and revealing the wound to the one performing the suture.
This is the common suturing method: take the needle, or count the needles according to the width of the wound; leave from the end of the disruption on the ring finger, and tighten the needle, making sure not to place the thread in both ends of the suture, with two ends of the linen under the internal parts, until you penetrate from that part; you have already gathered two ends of the suture and two ends of the linen, making four orders.
Then, tighten with double thread around the needle, sometimes from both sides together, and bring the two edges of the wound together properly; leave a finger's width and insert another needle, tying it with thread as you did with the first needle; continue doing this with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
The needles should be moderately thick, as very thin needles easily cut the flesh, and very thick ones are difficult to insert into the linen, so they should be of moderate thickness and fineness.
The needle should not be placed too close to the two ends of the linen, to avoid easily cutting the flesh and causing the wound to open before healing.
The sutures should not be prolonged so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
Cut the ends of the needles so they do not hurt the patient while sleeping; apply powders over the sutures to cover the ends of the needles and leave them until you know the wound has healed.
This type of needle suture is more suitable for small wounds, as one or two needles are enough for suturing them.
But the second suture is common: you administer the four ends, two from the linen and two from the flax, at once, with a needle threaded with equally fine and thick thread.
And when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, return the needle from the same part you started, so the thread retracts from the uppermost part to the wound, making the suture like sewing fabric where the cloth is tightened.
Leave a space between each suture the size of the little finger's thickness.
And this suture is known to people.
And with such a suture, I closed the wound of a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a knife. The wound was larger than a palm, and around two palms of the intestine had protruded from the middle part of the abdomen. I reduced it after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound healed within about fifteen days. I treated it, and it healed; afterward, he lived for many years and maintained his health.
Other doctors had judged that he would not heal, but it was a miracle because I treated him without ointment, as it was a place where ointment or any medicine was not available. Instead, I applied old cotton twice a day and washed it regularly with honey water until it healed.
But I will describe two specific types of sutures according to Paracelsus.
The first is to start with the suture from the linen, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.
When the needle penetrates the linen and follows a straight path along the length of the body, leave the end of the thread in which the needle was inserted; then insert the needle in the other end from inside to outside at the other end of the wound.
Once you have done this penetration, insert the needle again from the same end of the wound, from outside to inside; leave the end of the thread on that side and insert the needle on the other end from inside to outside.
Insert the needle with the thread into the end of the wound so that it penetrates completely.
Then, start from the same side and sew it with the end of the thread on the other side. Remove the needle from the linen it penetrated, reinsert it into the linen, and sew the end of the thread on the other side with this end of the wound; remove it from the linen on that side.
Do this once and again, repeating until you have sewn everything outside according to that example.
The essence of this suturing method is to sew it with a stitch similar to leather stitching, sewing the thread from the linen once from the end, and leaving it again until it is completed.
But the second specific type of suture, which is known as Gualia, is described as follows: you sew it similarly to how some doctors sew it, by matching each part to its corresponding part as naturally as possible; and applying the end of one to the end of the wound, as I described to you.
You should place the needle at the end of the wound closest to you from the outside, making it penetrate inside at that point, leaving two ends of the thread; then, turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside at two ends of the thread.
Then, turn each one and make each one penetrate from inside to outside in two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
This method of suturing is better than the common light suture and is the one I mentioned before.
This is the teaching of Gualia.
Some might say that the abdominal suture is done with two needles, each threaded, starting with the insertion of the needle from your side and making it penetrate to the other side, according to the way you would sew skins.
Know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, suturing it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
But the assessment of the wound treatment is the same as for other wounds.
The reason is that if you treat the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, sew it, and dress it properly, then you apply an incarnative powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are available to you until it forms a hard scab and the threads fall out, and the skin and flesh are consolidated; then treat it as you would other wounds until it is healed.
But if you don't have medicines available, then apply old cotton as soon as it starts to discharge, changing it twice a day as instructed, until it heals, because you won't need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound might affect the principal organs, then you should soak wool in well-tempered oil or rose oil and apply it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, which happens often, then wash it with lukewarm astringent black wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and is making its way into the abdominal cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestine.
It is difficult to heal because the intestine called "jejunum" does not heal well from any wound due to the large number of veins and the size of those veins, the thinness of its tissue, and its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum, and you manage it while it is still fresh, reduce it carefully as you would reduce the intestines.
But if it has already turned green or black, then tie it off with thread at the discolored spot to allow blood to flow, because the omentum contains veins and arteries.
Then cut below the tie and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside, to relieve the tension on the omentum and allow for the drainage of the wound.
Recollection of wounds when they occur in the intestines.
When a disruption occurs in the intestines and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people, because I saw someone who had been wounded in the stomach with a lance; the wound was on the right side of the stomach, it had become old and formed a fistula, and there was discharge and gas coming out of it.
So I undertook the treatment of it, even though I was not confident in its healing, but I continued to carefully treat it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And once I saw the area consolidated, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his stomach; but nothing bad happened, and he remained in good health, eating and drinking, and even taking baths and exercising as he used to.
And some experienced people have said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this way: you take ants with large heads; then you bring the two lips of the wound together and place an ant with its mouth open on the two lips of the wound; when it bites and tightens its mouth, you cut off its head, as it adheres and does not come off.
Then place another ant next to the first one, and continue doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then you reduce the wound and sew it; and those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
It is also possible that the intestine can be tied with a thin thread made from animal intestines, which is attached to it and then threaded through a needle; you take the end of this gut thread, make it very clean, and tie it to another thread, wrap it, and then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then it is not healing but a refinement, and it is not a complete healing.
On the treatment of sores and fistulae.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it worsens and becomes old, and turns into an ulcer, and is not healed and continuously discharges and is not cut off, then, in any part of the body, it is universally called a fistula and we call it azukem.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, felt-like node that is not painful and has a cavity like a bird's feather shaft; hence, some call it rizatz, that is, feather.
And in some people, it is moist, discharging fluid; and very quickly the moisture can be cut off in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scant, thick, or thin.
All these causes have been shown, along with their signs and the treatment with medicines, in the division.
And it is necessary that I inform you about the treatment of fistula, which is done by surgical operation.
And know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the omentum, or the intestines, or the bladder, or some of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or some of the joints composed in a way similar to the hand and foot; and among those are the ones that harm the proximity of the principal member and similar areas.
And therefore, those among these fistulas which are of this kind are diseases of difficult healing, and do not receive treatment, and dealing with them is laborious and ignorant.
And if there is a fistula, the depth of which does not reach these places that I mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and want to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, then explore it with that.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is relieved and curved towards the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to identify it with a probe.
Then inject fluid through its openings, because the moisture with which you inject it will go to the other openings and flow out of them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way it is possible for you to determine if there is bone or nerve here, and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow, or if it is a fistula with many openings; consider all this with the sum of your skill, your questioning of the patient, the finding of pain by pressing with your hand on the area, and the appearances of the signs and the causes related to the abscess.
And when you have considered all these causes with true understanding, then come to the treatment with confidence: consider whether the fistula is close or in a safe place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you.
Then you dry the fistula as previously described, remove what is in it by filtration and the corrupted flesh, and what has grown in the opening from flesh or other similar tissue, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is deep, and straight, then it must be cut with a knife as much as possible, and then clean it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply sponges soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood with the iron probe.
And do this with it several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you examine it and dry it as we have recommended, unless some vein, nerve, or principal part prevents you as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that causes it to regenerate until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and still discharges as it did before, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; and then you expose it again and carefully perform the scraping and cleaning with your utmost skill, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which cannot be reached, and then it is best to leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you extract it with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any behind with your skill.
But if some cause of moisture interferes with you, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then you incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if it is not the right time for you to remove the bones, then place over the wound something that can rot the wound, and leave it until it reaches around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the section that you have incised in your operation open.
Further, if you fear, place over it a cotton soaked in soap and oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in some of the green ointments, for when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal is eased.
But if it is a large bone such as the bone of the leg or thigh or similar to those, and what is corrupted is only the surface, then scrape it only slightly until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh so that you may take it as an example and help in your operation.
It was a young man about 30 years old, who suffered pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts of the body the bad matter moved to the thigh, and it was matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
And so the time was extended due to the error of the doctors until the abscess burst, and much matter came out, and its treatment was delayed until the leg developed fistulas, and many openings formed, all of which discharged pus and body fluids.
And then many doctors treated him for about two years, and none had a skilled hand in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in large amounts; and the man's body was completely wasted and his color was jaundiced.
And then I inserted the probe into one of those openings and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the openings and found that they all reached the bone in various parts of the leg.
And then I hastened and incised over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already crumbly and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I believed that it was not in the bone but only that corruption which I had excised and sawed off, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, and it did not heal.
And then I repeated and exposed the bone again from the first exposure, and found continued corruption with the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to treat and restore it, and it did not heal.
And then I exposed it again and did not cease incising the bone little by little in parts and forced its restoration, and it did not heal until I incised about a palm's width of it, and extracted it with its marrow, and then restored it with medicines, and it healed slightly and was healed.
And repetition of the operation and cutting is not necessary except for the condition of its fragility and the lack of its tolerance and fear of death, as it caused frequent bad syncope from excess evacuation.
And then he was healed completely, and in place of the bone there was hard flesh; and his condition was good in his body and his strength returned; and he resumed his usual activities and had no trouble walking nor any other problem.
But if it is a prominent bone in a location of the body that is already cut, then you should proceed in this manner: take a bandage and tie it at the end of the prominent bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; place a thicker wool bandage over the first bandage; and then tie it over the flesh below the bone, and extend the end of it so that you pull the flesh downwards, and you expose the flesh over the place you want to saw so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
And place wood or a board under the bone decently, because when you do this the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And the sawing should be done over the corrupted part little by little, because if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface, it will be necessary to saw it again.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, and it is a single continuous piece, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you expose all the flesh around it; and then place wood under it, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And the sawing should be done a little according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in the cutting but rather in the skill.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the foot, it is very difficult; however, you should examine the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and you should expose it, and clean it according to whatever condition is possible for you, and with whatever skill is suitable for you, as long as it does not interfere with any vein or nerve.
And you should know that the cutters and saws used to incise these bones vary according to the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity; therefore you must prepare the appropriate instrument for each type of operation.
And you should know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; because for you there is great study and long experience and knowledge of the methods of this art, and witness to the types of illnesses, as you then have for yourself what is suitable for the instruments for each illness.
And I am providing you at the end of this chapter with the list of instruments that you will use with examples with which you will proceed in your practice which you will experiment with on others. Form of a saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of a rasp: Let the head of this rasp be in the form of a star-shaped nail, and the points be in the form of the points of a stele.
And it is only necessary that with it the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or if the opening is large and wide.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad razor:
Form of another decently made saw: let it be made with a high arch and the sharpness of it of iron, and its handle of properly made wood. Form of it:
Form of a razor with a concavity:
Form of another fine razor:
Form of another razor with a curved end:
Form of a small razor similar to a probe:
Form of another smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one similar to a rasp, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in bone operations:
Form of a rasp which is suitable for cutting bones:
And its end is triangular and sharp.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly all the things we have mentioned about razors and incisors and saws.
On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities can rot either due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or when you have treated that corruption with healing medicines and the healing does not occur, or you see the corruption spreading towards the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may avoid death or severe damage which is a greater detriment to the limb.
And the sign of one to whom this occurs is that the limb turns black as if it had been burned, or it rots near the blackness until that rot spreads to the limb and takes over the whole body; and then you should quickly incise it.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the bite of some venomous creature such as a sea scorpion, viper, spider, or similar.
And if the corruption or the bite is on the fingertip, then you should incise the finger and not give the corruption space to spread to the hand.
Similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you should incise it at the root of the wrist, and not give the corruption space to reach the arm.
And if it invades further, then you should incise the arm at the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then the patient’s death is imminent; administering another cure is only a matter of grace.
Similarly, for the foot, when corruption invades the toe, you should incise it up to one of the joints.
And if it reaches the instep of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it rises to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no skill left but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.
And the way to incise the limb or to saw it is that you tighten the bandage on the part below where you want to incise, and tighten another bandage above the location; and the assistant should extend a bandage to the lower parts, and another assistant should extend a bandage upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two bandages in a broad space until all the flesh is exposed; and then incise or saw it.
And it is necessary to place linen cloth all around so that it does not touch the healthy part, and that the patient receives a proper bandage and careful dressing.
But if bleeding occurs while you are working, then you should quickly cauterize the location, or place some powders to staunch the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then tie the wounded limb with a bandage at a suitable place, and treat it until it is healed.
And I will recount to you what happened to a man with his foot, this very same incident which I have recounted to you, which is that blackness occurred on his foot with a burning that seemed like a fire burn.
And that corruption first occurred on his toe until it spread to his whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, seeing that the treatment was progressing to the limb with the severity of what he found of pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and he was healed.
A long time later, the same corruption occurred on the finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that superfluity with what I placed on his hand of medicines, after cleaning his body; and the superfluity was not counteracted and began to spread to the other finger until it started on the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, and I did not want to do it, hoping for the counteraction of that superfluity, and more because I feared the death of the patient from the incision of his hand, as his strength was severely diminished.
And after he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it came to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have included this story only to help with understanding this disease, and to be an example for which it may be recognized and according to which one should act.
On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of irrigation with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is released from it, and the place remains empty almost as if it were a vessel, and the membrane over it is like a fine cloth, and it has not progressed to deep corruption, and it does not impinge upon the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not named a fistula.
But if the space is prolonged until the corruption presses on some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to incise that entire membrane as it is twisted, and especially when it is thin and is like cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
But if you expect the membrane to adhere and that the corruption has not yet achieved deep progression, and the membrane has a clear space, then you treat it with irrigation.
And this is what you do: consider the sinus, and if it is large and the discharge is of a fetid odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine made of oil and sour wine and ginger in equal parts, and place them in a vessel, and cook them over the fire until the medicine turns red and takes on the consistency of honey.
Then you take from it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and irrigate the sinus with it, and tighten the opening of it, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then expel it with pressure; and do this for several days until the sinus is cleansed and the odor is gone.
Sometimes, the sinus is irrigated with ash water when this medicine is not available; you take vine ash and put it in water; then strain it and irrigate the sinus with it until you are sure that the sinus is cleared.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then irrigate with water and honey mixed with crushed ginger, and irrigate with wine and honey mixed, because the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you do this several times and you are sure that the sinus is gone, then irrigate it with something that makes flesh grow in it.
And this is done by taking some dyafinicon ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you irrigate it with some medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow so that the irrigation cannula cannot enter, then you gradually widen it with an iron instrument, and place a reed wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
Similarly, if the opening is wide, then you sew the edges together and leave a small amount of space for the irrigation cannula without addition.
And if the opening from which the discharge flows is elevated above, then drain it from the lowest point that is in it so that the discharge flows downwards, because when the discharge is confined in the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow in it.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus from the lower edge of the bone as you wish, then you must prepare the member with a preparation through which the discharge flows lightly as is prepared by you, and that no cause of the discharge is retained in it.
But the one that is over the opening of the sinus, you remove at all times so that it can expel what is lodged in it from the discharge. And so you know if what flows from it from the discharge is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And also you consider the location of that sinus, if the patient feels pain in it or not, and if there is an abscess in it.
And when your treatment is prolonged in such a manner, and you see the matter that is thrown on the opening of the sinus already adhering, or is starting to adhere, then in the morning you untie it or on the third day, and when you untie the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus after a long time a subtle discharge still comes out, then do not despair of its adherence, because the healing of it is approaching, for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and in those, the opposite is true.
And if from the sinus for many days undigested discharge has come out, then know that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you add to the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry as dyafinicon ointment, when it is added to it with the excess of wax.
And the last thing with which it is treated is that you take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and pour over it aged wine equal in its substance, and mix it with it, and use that.
And do similarly in that action, when there is no discharge, dyafinicon ointment, honey cooked until it thickens, and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense, crush all and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire, and then spread that on a cloth and press it over the sinus; and spread that with the honey you have cooked until it thickens, and powder it over the cloth and press it.
And sometimes it is treated with long aristolochia and roots of heavenly lily (that is, heavenly lily) and flour of iris and centaury, and use these simply or mixed, crush them and sift and powder them over the honey which I have mentioned; and use that.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in its depth, and already seek it in the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat it with fistular treatment, as mentioned above.
On the treatment of panarici and damaged nails, and the incision of extra fingers and their removal.
A panarici is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb or toe and quickly appears on other fingers. When it persists and its treatment is neglected, or when it is caused by a hot abscess or becomes corrupted, it discharges pus that corrodes the root of the nail, quickly destroying the entire nail, often reaching the bone and causing a foul odor. This makes the end of the finger swollen, and the color turns dark.
So, when you have treated it with the method we described earlier and it does not respond to the treatment, you must then cut away all the remaining nail with an iron instrument and then cauterize the wound thoroughly because cauterization is very beneficial in such cases.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is intact, and the edges of the nail press into the surrounding flesh causing pain and injury, you must place a thin wedge under the edge of the nail that presses on the flesh, push it up, and easily cut that flesh. Apply corrosive burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all removed, then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, you must cut and remove the affected bone, for it will never heal as long as the bone remains corrupted.
And if you see the corruption and decay spreading in the finger, you must cut it at one of the joints as previously indicated and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail is injured by a blow or friction and causes severe pain, you must initially bleed the patient, then cut the nail with a sharp blade in a transverse section from top to bottom. Be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause the patient intense pain and will lead to the growth of excess flesh in the area. Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
An extra finger, which some people are born with on their hands, is often entirely fleshy, sometimes contains bones, or is sometimes found on the nail.
Some of these are born at the root of the joint, or they may originate from some joints of the fingers. But those that are born on the finger joints are usually not harmful, while those on the joints are more troublesome.
For those that are purely fleshy, the removal is easy: you simply cut it at its root with a broad blade.
But for those that originate from the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; therefore, be cautious in removing them.
For those born on the finger near the joints, you must first cut the flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, then saw through the bone with a suitable saw, and then treat it until it heals.
But the fusion that occurs between the fingers sometimes by birth, by healing of a wound, by burning, or similar causes, you must cut through that fusion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place linen cloth soaked in rose oil between them so they do not easily re-fuse, and keep them separated, or place a thin lead sheet between them until they heal properly.
Similarly, if fusion occurs between some fingers and the palm, cut through the fusion according to the shape and configuration of the member.
On the incision of varices, which are varicose veins.
Varices, also known as varicose veins, are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They often appear in many parts of the body, but are most common in the legs, especially in people who travel, labor, or carry heavy loads.
Thus, it is necessary to purge the body of black bile occasionally with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is done in two ways: one involves making an incision and drawing out the black blood, and the other involves lifting and removing the entire vein.
The incision is done in this manner: first, soak the leg with hot water until the thick blood, which is thickened in the leg, is dissolved. Then, tightly bind the leg of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Next, make an incision in the vein at one or two or three places with a broad cut, and draw out the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward and from the top downward, until the desired amount of blood is extracted and you see that it is enough to relieve the patient.
Then, bandage the area and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
Repeat the treatment by phlebotomy whenever the veins are filled and it troubles the patient.
But lifting the veins is done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs, then put it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins become prominent. Alternatively, have the patient perform vigorous exercise if a bath is not available, until the limb is heated.
Then, make an incision in the skin over the vein with a long cut either behind the knee or lower down near the heel.
Next, open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it is fully visible, and you see it turning dark red to black.
Then, when you see it and the surrounding tissue looks white like a cord.
Next, insert a rod under it to lift it and detach it from the surrounding tissue, then suspend it with a hook.
Then make another incision about three fingers' width from the first, and strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it is exposed.
Next, lift the vein and cut it at the lower incision near the heel, then extract and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and continue extracting it from the upper incisions.
Continue this process until you have extracted it from the highest incision, until the entire vein is removed, and then cut it.
If you have difficulty extracting and lifting it, insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it off, then extract it, or insert the rod underneath and twist your hand around it until it is removed. Be careful not to cut it; if it breaks, it will be very difficult to lift and will cause harm to the patient.
Once you have removed it completely, place a cloth soaked in wine, rose oil, and regular oil over the wound and treat it until it heals.
If the vein is contracted and twisted, and has loops at parts, and is not straight as described, you must make incisions over each twisted part and at the loops, then suspend it with hooks until you can lift it entirely.
Be careful during the incisions not to cut or injure the vein, as it will be difficult to lift; use your skill and prudence.
Shape of the tool used for vein sectioning:
It is not sharpened like a hook, nor does it have a pointed end so that it does not harm the vein; and it has a thick, flexible body, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; rather, it has an excessive thickness as we have said.
On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
This vein is found in the legs in hot regions such as Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and dry lands of India, where little soft tissue exists and no grass or trees grow.
It is also easily found in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Its formation is due to putrefaction under the skin, just as snakes, worms, and scarabs form within the body between the skin and the flesh.
A sign of its presence is a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by blistering at the site, and then the vein begins to emerge from the blistered area like a root from a plant.
When the tip appears, wrap a piece of lead weighing one or two drachms around it, and let the lead hang from the leg.
Each time a part emerges, wrap it with lead and tie it off. If it is very long, make an incision in part of it and wrap the rest. Do not cut it close to the root until it is fully out, as cutting it too early will cause it to retract into the flesh, leading to abscess, rot, and a bad ulcer.
Thus, it should be treated gently and extracted little by little until it is completely out, leaving nothing behind in the body.
In some men, this vein has reached a length of five, ten, or even twenty palms.
If it is incised during treatment, insert the rod into the wound and puncture it along the length of the body until all the material is evacuated. Treat the area for a few days with medicines that counter putrefaction, then heal it as you would an abscess.
Sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, where it emerges through many openings, with each opening giving rise to a branch.
Treat it as described above, following the steps mentioned.
On the cutting over worms generated under the skin, known as bovine disease.
This disease is called the "bovine disease" in some lands because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that grows between the skin and the flesh, traveling throughout the body, moving up and down, and can be felt as it moves from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.
Its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just like worms, serpents, and roundworms in the intestines.
It is feared for its malignancy, as when it travels through the body and reaches the head, it can quickly penetrate the eye and destroy it, which happens frequently.
Therefore, when you want to treat and remove it, it can only be done by tracking its movement and feeling it. Then, tightly bind the area above and below it, make an incision over it, and extract it.
If it is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, use a cautery iron to burn the area until it dies. The main concern is its corruption, which can damage the area as mentioned.
If it reaches the head near the eye, bind the area above the eyebrow tightly, make an incision over it, and extract it. The patient should then cleanse their body with medicines that expel putrid humors and avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Regarding the section on the illness called nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain that comes to some limbs, and is often transferred from limb to limb.
And I have seen that according to what I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm, and after an hour, I saw that swelling move as if a worm was climbing up, but more lightly than could be, as if it were quicksilver running from place to place.
And then the pain moved from that place and settled in the muscle, and stayed there for about an hour.
And then it ran through the body until it reached the other arm.
And then she recounted to me that it revolved throughout her entire body as I saw; and I was very amazed by the movement and the speed from limb to limb. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in that manner, but I have seen many cases where the pain was transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my eyes as I did in the woman.
And I do not think this is anything but because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way, that moving swelling appeared to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this back-and-forth movement in those who are healthy and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And when you want the cure for this, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to you by sight as we have said, then you press on it and gently shake it until that trapped swelling comes out, and cauterize the spot.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with exercise of the body and with things that expel swellings, and treat them with foul-smelling pills and with serapic pills and the like.
Regarding the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are varied according to their types, and according to the places in the bodies where they strike, because their diversity is such that some have large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, which means solid; and among them are those with three edges, and those with barbs; and those with splinters.
And the signs of the brain are when the arrow strikes there, and it pierces the bone, and it comes out from the covering that is over the brain, because it happens with sudden vehemence, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and very soon speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed, and from the place of the wound comes out white moisture resembling dust, and something comes out that looks like the moisture of the flesh.
And so if these signs appear to you, then you refrain from the treatment and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it strikes the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is stuck in a hard place, and not an empty place; and very soon the movement of the arrow is like the movement of the pulse, and from the wound flows black blood, and follows coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and then you know that death descends without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the spitting of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are swollen, and the color of the patient is changed, and they exhale with a great noise, and demand the attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering that is in the chest, and the pain then is near the lower ribs, and a great swelling is made with vehement pain and sighing, and not all the muscle members are harmed.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then very soon from the wound comes out some undigested food.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is stuck there, some contents of the wound come out, or the membrane, or the intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope in the cure by extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out, and something passes to the external parts, and very soon there is pain over the patient, then you know it is mortal.
But the other members like the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the thigh, and the leg, and their similar members, are saved according to the major conditions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisonous arrow.
And I will recount this to you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may know about your treatment.
Which case is, because in a man, an arrow struck in the tear duct of his eye in the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, under the cartilage of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which struck him in the cartilage of his eye, under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and only a small tip with which it was attached to the shaft was obtained, and it was a large arrow from the sharp arrows of the Turks, with iron tip that did not have barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had struck his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and it had barbs; and so I cut over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I delicately worked with it, and soon I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had struck his abdomen, and I thought he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut over the arrow and worked on it, and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow struck his back, and the wound healed over it, and after nearly seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow struck her abdomen, and the wound healed inside, and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow struck his face and the wound healed over it and the arrow remained, finding no pain there, and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from the man of the prince of the king which had struck the middle part of his nose and had already shifted a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to the treatment of him soon after the arrow struck within three days.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt a prick under his right ear, and then I suspected that the prick was from the tip of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster to the location with an attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would form an abscess so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, and so it could be accessed.
And no significant accident occurred at the location indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient remained without extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow in his nose and reported it to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe, I examined it, and I found the fine tip of the arrow, which was attached to the shaft.
And then I continued applying the medicine to the opening of the wound until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time on this for a period of four months.
And then, after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it and remove it, and if it did not obey extraction, then I did not cease to handle and work on it with various techniques, until one day I started using techniques to grasp it with properly made forceps, according to the form that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, and I restored it and the wound healed, and the patient was completely healed, and it did not harm him in any way.
And I recount to you the quality of the extraction of some arrows so that you set a rule and understanding about what I have not said, because the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended with narration nor do they comprehend the book.
And the wise practitioners compare little over much; and from what is present over what is absent; and find new operations and new instruments for the descent of the external causes of the art when it happens.
And so I say that arrows are not extracted from the limbs where they are stuck except in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered; or by the opposite side.
And the one that is extracted from the place where it entered, it is an arrow stuck in a fleshy place, and it is pulled and extracted.
And if it does not obey extraction from the hour it struck, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it decays, and the extraction and egress are eased.
And similarly, if it is stuck in bone and does not obey extraction, then leave it for some days and repeatedly pull and move it each day, and then it will be extracted.
And if it does not obey extraction after some days, then you must perforate around the arrow in that bone on all sides with a fine drill until the place around the arrow is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in the body, and hidden from sensation, then you search for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it with some instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot manage it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then you work on the wound until it is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it has barbs by which it is held, then you release the flesh in which it is stuck on all sides with all the skill you can manage; and work on it, if you cannot manage the evasion of the flesh with the fracture of the barbs and their twisting until it obeys.
And when you manage the extraction of the arrow in any place where it is, then you use twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides until it obeys; and work with utmost subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then you leave it for a few days until the parts around it decay, and then work on it again because then it will be eased. But if you encounter a flow of blood, then you manage it as we have discussed in its chapter.
And guard your skill from cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and manage it with every technique you can for the evasion of the arrow; and do this with ease and tranquility and slowness and firmness as I have recounted to you.
And so you contract the arrow so that the patient is according to the shape according to which it was when the arrow struck him, because it is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then you manage with what is possible for you with the shapes.
But the arrows that are extracted by the opposite side, or where some part of it already protrudes outward, or the tip of the arrow causes swelling by sensation of the part above the close flesh and sometimes that part is prominent; then you cut over it; and the cutting should be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp; and then you pull it, because it is made easier to extract.
But if it is held in the bone, then you twist the blade counter to the way until the arrow presses into the bone, and enlarges itself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for some days, and then work on it until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then you push it with it.
But if the shaft is broken and you want to push, then you insert into it, if it is broken, a concave instrument so that it fits into the concavity of the arrow's tail and then push it with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is eased by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must excise all the flesh where the poison is, if this is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough for you to touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it, then cut over it and guard against cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if needed, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which the arrows are extracted:
Let their ends be like a bird's beak which are made with a saw so that they do not let go of the arrow.
And many types of these are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
like a ray so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with it.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy from which the usual places to perform it are as follows: two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes called aspicientz; a vein in the middle of the forehead; a vein at the tip of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins in the upper lip; two veins in the lower lip; — these are the veins called algelic —; and two veins under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five: One of these is the cephalic vein, which is on the outer side; and people call it "the head vein," also known as the middle vein, composed of a branch of the basilic vein and another branch of the cephalic vein; people call this "the vein of the whole body," and the basilic vein is on the inner side, known as “citillar,” called by common people "the vein of the belly"; the funis of the arm, located over the elbow, is the one where phlebotomy is performed, appearing over the pulse by clear manifestation; and salvatella, which is the vein between the ring finger and the little finger, located in two branches.
In the foot and leg, there are three veins; one is under the curve of the knee on the outer side; the second is the saphenous vein, located under the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, located under the leg on the outer side; in the leg, there are other veins similar to these.
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for old catarrhs and migraines and scurf and old head ulcers.
The method of bleeding these veins is as I tell you: shave the head of the patient, and rub the back of the patient's head where both veins are with a large cloth with good friction; then tighten the patient's neck with a band until the two veins and their places appear near the ears at two pressed places on the head; and find them with your finger, and if you feel their pulse with your finger, mark the spot with a probe.
Then take the lancet knife, which is for incision, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and the skin upwards and incise the vein with an incision knife. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers joined or around that; and let as much blood flow out as you want.
Then press it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And it is already mentioned at the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization.
But for the two arterial veins in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and severe migraines, persistent ophthalmia, and acute excessive discharges from the eyes.
And the method to phlebotomize them is as I tell you: have the patient tighten their neck greatly until the two veins appear by sensation through clear manifestation and their pulse is felt under your finger; then mark with a probe.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, insert the incision phlebotomy tool underneath, lift the vein upwards; and incise it as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.
Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton and powders on it and press it tightly, and leave it until it is healed.
And the remembrance of them, and their incision, and the extraction is already mentioned at the beginning of the book.
And thus the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for chronic facial diseases and migraines and redness and foul ulcers.
And the method of phlebotomy there is as I tell you; that is, the patient tightens their neck with a band until the vein appears; then take the instrument called fossori of which this is its form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossori on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other object in that manner, and let the blood flow as much as you want; then loosen the patient's constriction and press it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotomy tool, but the phlebotomy tool should not be of sharp extremity like the other phlebotomy tools, rather it should be of wide extremity, and phlebotomize it transversely, because the bone is close and it would easily break the phlebotomy tool if it is fine.
But the benefit of the two veins in the tear ducts of both eyes is for scab in the eyes, redness, and inflammation in the eyes, and facial diseases.
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient tightens their neck with a band, then phlebotomize those, and you stand over the patient's head.
And perform the phlebotomy transversely a little with a small phlebotomy tool, because there is no flesh in that area; and if the phlebotomy tool is fine, its extremity will break easily.
And then let the blood flow as much as you need, place cotton on them, and press them for one night, and then loosen them.
But the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and sudden severe fever, facial diseases, migraines, and redness that occur on the face, especially when chronic.
And the method of phlebotomy there is that the patient tightens their neck and you hold their nose with your left hand, take the fine long phlebotomy tool and insert it in the middle of the nose tip straightly, because the vein does not appear by sensation there, and because the blood starts to flow immediately.
You should gradually withdraw your hand with the phlebotomy tool and let the blood flow according to your need; then bind it for one night, because it heals quickly.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two guidegui veins is for nasal constriction, the onset of leprosy, many diseases, impetigo, and corrosive ulcers like herpes.
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that the patient tightens below each vein in their neck with a band; the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.
Then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy tool little by little; then extract blood in a moderate amount or according to what is necessary for that; then do the same with the other vein.
Then loosen the band and press the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until the morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the algelic veins is for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, and fissures, and bad ulcers in the nose and its surrounding area.
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that you make the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a band, then turn their lips and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of both, and more so because around them are small black veins; then incise each with an incision tool.
But if you have doubt, and do not know which one it is, then you should proceed to incise the largest of those, and the most apparent of those.
And do the same with the two veins in the upper lips.
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins under the tongue is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for inflammations in the throat, diseases of the uvula, and mouth diseases.
And the method of phlebotomizing those is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, from one side to the other, and the color of each is leaning towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to keep your hand too long in phlebotomizing those, because there are arteries underneath them.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are the ones where blood usually flows in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either puncture with the myrtle or olive phlebotomy tool with a declining subtlety; or cut with a knife-like phlebotomy tool, called alnessil, and this is its form:
it is wide like some, and suitable for opening concave veins that are visibly large, and for those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy tool is narrower and has a finer tip, and is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine, yellowish blood.
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it extracts the blood from the diseases that are below the throat and neck, and from what follows to the chest and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing that phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious because there is an artery underneath, and if he makes a mistake and hits the artery with the phlebotomy tool, it will cause blood flow, so he should not phlebotomize it with a puncturing tool, but rather cut with the alnessil.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then you should leave it and move to another, or look for one of its branches; or phlebotomize in the place at the end of the arm, because it is visible; and cut it with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said.
But if you want to perform the phlebotomy yourself, then you should first tighten the arm and find the pulse point, then mark it with ink; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said; and be careful not to let the cut fall in the area of the artery.
And when you see, while tightening the binding, swelling in the place you marked with ink, that swelling is from the artery, and then you should avoid it.
And if you see the blood flow in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then you know it is arterial blood; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, because often it does, then you should bind the arm and leave it.
And protect the patient from movement, be cautious with him and do not disturb him for some days until it is healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you do not have the necessary medicine, then you cut the artery if it appears; because its end is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or you take the bark of pistachio, prepare it, take one half and press it on the vein with a descending tightness with a bandage and powders until the next day.
And then if the blood stops, good; if not, then treat it with what is previously mentioned about the powders that stop blood flow.
And stopping the blood there is difficult in many cases because of the small area of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But the phlebotomy of the fusca vein benefits by extracting the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it; and if he punctures with the phlebotomy tool and hits the nerve, it will cause numbness, and its healing is difficult, and it may never heal completely. And this nerve is sometimes felt; and if it is hidden in some people and is thin and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy tool with which you perform the incision with the alnessil, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you make the vein longitudinally.
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this one specifically, if you want to phlebotomize it, to use the olive or myrtle phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery or nerve underneath it.
But nevertheless, it often becomes inflamed in some people, when it is not phlebotomized with the first percussion, but this inflammation does not harm at all.
The first thing you need to know is that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health and with the hope and caution of preventing diseases, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins in the elbow, that is: cephalic, fusca, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.
And phlebotomy should be done on the third day or the first after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy that is administered, when it causes convenience and necessity, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child is not phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman is not phlebotomized except from the fourth month to the seventh, and the elderly are not phlebotomized who have already passed sixty years.
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized in any manner, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a leon enema, if there is much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the impurities in the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and do not harm the principal organs.
And patients with excessive nausea and hangover should not be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until it has passed, nor those suffering from dropsy, and phlebotomy should be avoided near colic pain and vomiting, and near bowel conditions, and near excessive coitus and work and exercise from fasting or vigils and any cause that weakens the strength, whether bodily or animal.
And also consider the thinning of humors before this if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible to do so.
And take a bath beforehand if no cause prohibits it, or exercise in some way so that the blood is thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy in the morning, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And make sure that the patient's peace is guarded on that day from all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive work, pain, coitus, and similar things.
And at their side, have present the things that men usually use with aromaticity and fragrance, and with balm and similar things according to the quantity possible.
And the phlebotomist should sit on a stool that is higher than the stool of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
And then, extend their arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.
And let the tightness be moderate, because if the tightness is not equal, or if it is too tight, it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it prevents the proper flow of blood outward.
And after the tightening, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and become visible.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint the phlebotomy tool with a bit of old oil; and then place the index finger of the left hand on the vein, below the spot where the phlebotomy is to be done, so the vein moves slightly, and the tapping ceases because some veins act like a fleeing string towards the phlebotomy, and some are full of air and when you place the phlebotomy tool on them, they contract towards the tool, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the tool does not open the vein, and if it does, the vein becomes narrow.
And therefore, the phlebotomist must be firm and diligent in all these matters.
And then place the phlebotomy tool, but if the vein is not opened at once, then it is good; otherwise, you should try again a little below that spot, or above it with speed, if the spot is not inflamed.
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient is scared, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, as it may quickly attract a cautious inflammation, and do not take a bath.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if it is necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the quantity of blood desired will not be released, then you should repeat the phlebotomy in that hole with precision and enlarge the opening a little, and do this quickly before the spot becomes inflamed, because the spot becomes inflamed in many people due to a small opening.
But if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it there, as there is no reason; and place some portion of the oil bandage on it, as it alleviates the blood flow. And it is better in this case than oil and other oils.
And similarly, administer an oil bandage in every phlebotomy in which you phlebotomize the veins to prevent blood flow, and use this theriac alfadoc and sagzenea when placed on the spot, as the blood becomes thinned and mixed when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the phlebotomy site, which often happens, especially to one who has not been bled before, or if the vein's opening is small, then hurry, and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly heated, and tighten it for an hour, because it will dissolve.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has flowed from that vein, with the closure of it or another vein.
And if there remains some darkness or greenness at the spot for a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it something made of aloe and dissolved myrrh, or something of mint or calamint juice or something similar.
And often abscesses and swellings occur due to phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is bad and harmful; and then be careful not to place on it any of the things we have mentioned, because it may quickly cause blood to flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has astringency, so that the spot is hardened, and then treat it with other care until it is healed.
And you need to extract blood from everyone according to the amount of their strength and according to the dominant color of the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it is thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs a single blood extraction, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the opening wide.
And in someone who is frail, do the opposite, and the blood should be extracted in multiple sessions, and the opening should be narrow.
And the best way to administer vein phlebotomy is that the cut be transverse, not punctured.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along latitude and longitude.
And for those prone to fainting from phlebotomy, it is necessary to treat them before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in pomegranate wine or simple heated oxymel; and extract a little blood in three or four sessions.
And if there is a cold constitution, then before phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in a very fragrant aromatic syrup.
And if fainting occurs due to phlebotomy, and it is caused by a lot of blood loss, then it is necessary to drink meat broth and very fragrant subtle syrup; and use aromatic substances with aloe, and rub their chest with it.
And use other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And anyone who wants to vent their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for those whose phlebotomy is for large evacuation, and their strength is weak, to evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to their strength, in continuous days.
But anyone who wants to vent their arm and expel their blood a second time, and their body is strong, should do this around seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But anyone who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side of the part to which it flows should be vented on the second or third day.
But a body in which there is a lot of blood already heated and acute and causing fever, it is necessary to expel a large amount of blood at once, and the opening should be enlarged until fainting occurs, after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand on the pulse to prevent death instead of fainting, as this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, as the opening of the vein is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it with force and the bent arm is slightly extended, as this is very bad.
First, leave it until it can be phlebotomized a second time; or remove the coagulated blood at the opening of the vein with the sharpness of the phlebotomy tool; or apply theriac alfarach, or sagzenea on it, and compress it lightly until the blood flows out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if you are forced to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no other option, then you bleed from that spot or from another vein in the other arm.
And the vein called "funis del bras" is phlebotomized instead of the fusca or the basilic vein when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
And then it should be tightly bandaged with moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize it with a small transverse cut, not longitudinally.
And the opening should be wide and your phlebotomy should be done on the vein a little above the wrist.
And if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve the desired amount.
But if it is during the summer, then you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water again, and it is better to immerse the body of the blood in warm water during the winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
And the phlebotomy of the right hand’s vein is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that you tightly bandage the hand or use your hand, after immersing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, it will not harm in any way.
And make sure not to press the hand too much with the phlebotomy tool, because beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
And then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in warm water again, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and restrict the flow.
And when the blood is extracted according to the needed amount, then apply oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from closing too quickly; and similarly, this should be done on all narrow openings.
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of that of the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases.
And do similarly in the phlebotomy of it as you did in the other.
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the uterus, and menstrual retention, and diseases of the kidneys and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins are clearly visible; and bandage above the ankle with a strap; and the location of the vein on the heel is visible towards the big toe, and from it branch many veins on the surface of the foot.
And then phlebotomize the widest branch or below the calf towards the heel towards its junction, as it is better and safer.
And if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves beneath it on the surface of the foot, and apply the phlebotomy transversely, almost as if you were cutting it.
And the phlebotomy should be gentle.
But if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the foot in warm water again and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist makes a mistake the first time, then try again a little higher, as the location is safe; and do not fear harm, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And for the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is towards the heel below the outer ankle.
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of it is for hip pain when it is due to bad blood.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bandages the thigh from the side of the hip down to the heel about four fingers in width with a long, thin bandage, because it is only visible in this way.
And then when it appears, phlebotomize it with whatever tool you can and transversely, as it is better; or cut it by incision or section, as the location is safe.
And it is very hidden in many people; and if you find it, and it is not visible by touch at all, then phlebotomize any branch of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot towards the little and ring toes.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow the desired amount.
And then untie the bandage and apply cotton on the phlebotomy site and press the spot, as it heals quickly.
On cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping with scarification and blood extraction is applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one place where cups are applied is the alnocrati, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle part of it on both sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the mandible further below the mouth; and cupping of both shoulder blades; and cupping of the alohoster, which is over the end of the tailbone; and cupping of the two upper arms, which are the two arms; and cupping of both ankles; and cupping of both thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not lose its effectiveness through these, unlike phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity forces cupping due to illness or continuously, administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at any time.
And then when you see any of those causes, and especially if it is on the third or middle of the month, then we command cupping to be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping on the nape is that it helps with heaviness in the head and those who are sunken around the eyes; but this should be done after evacuating the whole body.
And this cupping is in the location of the cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not lawful to use it on someone with a cold complexion, or who has catarrh, because it does great harm to them.
And therefore it should not be used on the elderly, and on those whose heads have cold diseases.
But for those who continue with it, it causes forgetfulness; and therefore you should command the cupper to lightly place their hand with the cup on the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping of alkehel is in the location of the phlebotomy of the dark and basilic veins: and therefore it helps with asthma, and the constriction of the chest and the splitting of the chest instrument, and cough, and repletion.
And it should be pressed a little, because if placed lower, it causes weakness in the body and stomach.
And the cupping of alhagdahan helps with accidental headaches and ophthalmia, and migraine, and preoccupation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in the location of the basilic phlebotomy.
And you should command the cupper not to press with the scarification so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin helps with ulceration in the mouth, and gingival corruption, and similar diseases in the mouth, and it stands in the location of the phlebotomy of the sublingual veins which are in the two lips.
But cupping done on both shoulder blades helps with headache caused by repletion of heat.
And cupping of the two parts inside the thighs helps the phlebotomy of three veins, which are the basilic, dark, and cephalic veins, because it attracts the blood from all those smaller veins in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And command the cupper not to proceed too much with the scarification, because the location is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And it is a cupping glass with which cupping is done over the sacrum and helps with hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And you should command the cupper to use a large cup, and it should be made of brass, because the location needs strong sectioning; and quickly small cups are placed and scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs decreases by clear diminution, because it draws the blood from the whole body, and helps with old pains in the kidneys and uterus, and the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and helps with swelling and dropsy; and it stands in the location of the phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alahorcoben, and both ankles.
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and causes fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping alahorcoben is similar to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the quality of the position of the cups is that you place the cup at first empty and suck with moderate suction, and do not prolong the position of the cups, but place them lightly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the location evenly. And do not stop repeating this and continue until you see the location redden and swell and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and carefully consider the condition of the bodies.
For the person with tender flesh and sparse pores, you should scarify once and no more, so that the location does not become ulcerated.
And command the cupper to make the scarification larger and a little deeper, and adjust the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then scarify twice, because the first time opens the way for thinning the blood and its watery part. But the second time it scrutinizes the acquired extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very feculent, then do the scarification a third time to achieve the final result.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or just a little, one scarification is enough.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we should scarify deeply.
And the limit of scarification is just the depth of the skin.
And if that of which the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the places for the cups should be smeared with softening, opening, and resolving agents; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balsamite oil, or aloe oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
But if the cupping patient has wide pores and tender flesh, then they should avoid oil, and it is advisable that the places for the cups near the cupping are washed with rose water or cold water of nightshade, or gourd water, or purslane water, and similar ones.
And those whose blood is very humid should wash the cups with vinegar, or water of myrtle and sumac and similar ones.
And those whose excesses are thick should wash the cups with old wine, or water of savory, which is marjoram, or decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar ones.
And it is advisable that cupping be done before bathing; beforehand it should be administered near the bath for one or two hours, and it is advisable to sleep near the cupping.
What is it that needs to be regulated for cupping or bloodletting before cupping.
You should consider at the beginning: if the cupping patient or the one who should be bloodletted is choleric and full of acute blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling agents, such as sour pomegranates, and endives with vinegar, and lettuce, and chicory, and julep, and similar ones.
And give them foods such as chickens, and game bird meats, and foods prepared with sour agents, and similar ones.
And for those whose complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of honey, or syrup of chicory seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine mixed between old and new; and it is recommended that they use little to drink and eat, and give them foods such as chickens, and partridges, and pigeons, and small birds.
And it is advisable that on the day of cupping and bloodletting the drink is more than the food.
And it is advisable to give at some hours to some people to drink theriac alpharac, or musk medicines, that is nutmeg, or alcelite before cupping or before bloodletting or nearby, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take it heated.
But the cups without scarification are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, on the knee joints, and the hip, because these members do not tolerate scarification on themselves.
And it is not intended for those except to attract blood from the member, as we place a cup on the breast in the disease of blood flow from the nose; and we use it to dissolve cold viscosity of the member, as we place it on the belly and navel; because it thins the member and warms it and removes the pain because it resolves wind.
And it is placed on the kidneys when obstruction or pus occurs in them, because by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the pus from its place.
And similarly it acts when placed on the liver and spleen against wind enclosed in them.
And these cups are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered filled with warm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cup is filled and is larger, that is hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this are cooked.
The form of the cup administered with fire: let the opening be two fingers wide, as we have formed it; and the depth be half a palm; and let it be on the side of it, in the place that is in the circuit, half of it, the hole be small as the amount that a needle can enter.
Let it be made of red brass or citrus, with thick edges, smooth, equal, and clean so that it does not harm the member upon its position on it.
And let it be in the middle of it a transverse rod of brass or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cup be much larger than the one we have mentioned; and a little smaller than that according to the diseases and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cups for children and the exhausted are different from the cups for the young and robust bodies.
And the quality of placing this cup with fire on the member is that it stretches the wick with the fire of decent wood in front of a little wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cup, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the body of the patient is not burned.
And then place it on the member of the patient, and the finger be on the hole that we mentioned, until when we hold the cups and do not need to hold the finger and let the steam out through that hole, then the cup will soon be released.
And ignite the wick properly, and repeat it if necessary.
But in a cup that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, and it is administered only by being filled with water, and it is placed on the member only.
And this is its form: And this cup, the larger it is, the better, so that it can receive a large amount of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not applied to many parts except to parts where it is not possible to place cups, due to the small size of those parts, such as the feet and gums and similar to them; or on parts devoid of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar to them.
And the quality of using those is that you have found leeches in clean freshwater ponds.
And then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry, and no substance remains in their stomachs; and then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's part until it reddens; and then place them on it.
And when they are filled and fall off.
And if it is possible to suction the place with a cup, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the place with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the blood continues to flow after the leeches fall off, and this happens, then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over it until the bleeding stops.
And if the blood is abundant, then sprinkle over it crushed vitriol, or galls and similar astringents, until the blood stops; or place on the site halves of cooked beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the site, and the blood stops.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, as often as you can replace them.
And if leeches are prohibited from being suspended, then rub the site with fresh blood or insert a needle into the sites until blood comes out; and then place them, because when they sense any blood, they will attach immediately.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation incidents in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and laypeople boast of this chapter and those who have never regarded the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, this manner of the learned in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time; and I have not adopted this except through long study of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experiment is based; as I have abbreviated this for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated this to the end of abbreviation; and I have shown this at the end of clarification; and I have formed in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as it is done by adding clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters.
First chapter.
Summaries and collections of the nature of bone fractures, from those whose preface is necessary, before we begin the recollection of broken members and the diversity of each. Therefore, we must state in the preface of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which at the beginning the practitioners are forced and to dwell on the truth of them; that is, you and those who are eager to know or learn this noble art among you.
And thus I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or falling occurs, then you must hasten at the beginning with bloodletting or alleviating that, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of strength, or if it happens to a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And then be content with a diet of fresh herbs and meat of birds and goats; and prohibit heavy meats and filling oneself with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are assured of preventing abscess, and if you do not fear the effusion of material to the part.
And then return the patient to their previous regimen with which they are accustomed.
And thus when the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient must be fed with nourishing food of substantial and heavy nutrition in which there is viscosity, such as foods made of wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar to them, and with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in people who are in their prime and in the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature due to the dryness of their parts.
But still nature joins and amends over the broken bone from all parts some substance similar to glue in which there is thickness that adheres and tightens it until they are glued together and bound together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, just like fire at the beginning, until no cause prohibits it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with food, food in which there is gravity and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the parts, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly, all other parts are different among them.
And I come with the recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its chapter distinct from the other.
Great diversity of fracture in itself. And the types of fracture of the bone are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture different from what occurs in stars; and sometimes there is a fracture along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of splinters and splinters and protruding and non-protruding additions, just as is done in the pen when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type, there is its own method or instrument in the restoration of it as will be remembered distinctly in its places.
Great signs of bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known: it is the tortuosity of it, and its prominence and appearance to the touch, and it is that when you compress it with your hand.
And thus when there is no apparent tortuosity in the place and it is not done by your touch when you touch the bone with movement and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is tortuosity or a small fissure, then you must not harm it with your hand and with complete compression; then apply to it the medicines which will be remembered at the appropriate moment for the place; and then it should be tightened with a subtle constriction.
And know that the place when it is arched and not split in two or different from what does not happen in splinters, as every part of its counterpart is kept, then you must begin immediately to rectify it before it gets a hot abscess.
And if it gets a hot abscess, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then straighten it in every way you can with lightness and skill.
And know that the restoration of it and the healing of it is easier than that of the bone in which splinters occur.
And then tighten it according to the remembrance of it.
But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of the broken part from two sides is necessary, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the part is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and the hand.
And be your position with which you place the part equal according to its natural shape, while the parts of the broken part are extended, then you must return those additions with skill and in every way you can in their places.
And guard yourself according to your strength that no pain or injury happens to the patient by your operation; and force yourself according to your ability to apply one bone with the other its companion according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch it with your hand, and if you see any deviation, correct and align it according to your ability.
And strongly avoid excessive extension and compression, as many foolish doctors often cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause contraction in the part, as we have seen happen many times by their operations.
And the quality of the constriction of the broken part is what I recount; so you know that broken parts are diverse in their smallness, greatness, and shape.
And for those that are small like the arm and the finger and the joint and similar to them, then the wrapping must be of very fine cloth.
But for those that are large like the thigh or the leg, they must be wrapped with broad and hard material, because the broad binding connects the large part and tightens it equally from all sides, so that no blemish enters.
And then begin, with your equable evacuation, to place a suitable binding on the site of the fracture with three or four wrappings as the part requires; and tighten your hand a little with the binding.
And then go with that to the upper part of the fracture site, and tighten less than the constriction with which you tightened the fracture site. And then extend the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and gradually loosen the constriction, until you take a large part from the site.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with wrapping, and then go with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the constriction of the wrapping and in the loosening of it as we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the wrappings flax tow or cloth with which the tortuosity of the fracture is equalized, if there is tortuosity; and if not, place nothing there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then properly align splints over these wrappings immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess at the site, and then place over it what soothes the abscess and removes the swelling; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be made of half a broad split reed, and well shaped wisely; or they be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and figure:
However, the splint placed over the fracture must be thicker and broader than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is suitable to the part in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your initial constriction; and then bind it decently with thread according to what we have said about constriction, and it is that your constriction be according to the site of the fracture mostly, and the further from the fracture, the lesser the constriction.
And the threads must be moderate in thickness and subtlety, and be of soft linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some foolish ones placing their threads of twisted linen rope, and it is a great error, because the constriction would be uneven.
And likewise thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them the constriction that you want, and there must not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the constriction in their places, then place flax tow or combed wool under them so that it does not cause injury.
Sometimes a fracture is with a wound, and there is disruption in the skin, and I will remember this in the chapter on special cases.
And know that not every broken part is constrained with splints on the first day; the reason is that when the part is large, you must not place splints on it for about five or seven days or more, according to your certainty of the coming of a hot abscess.
And this is the way of the poultices with which the Ancients restored, which are placed over fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Way of common poultice for the quick restoration of fracture, suitable for many complexions and mostly for women and children, because it is of that upon which neither heat nor cold prevails: and it is that you take mill dust, which is the fine part of the flour that hangs near the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And make it as it is, but sift it with egg white, and prepare the mixture not too thick nor too thin; and then use it.
Another method of a poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take asafetida, labdanum, acacia, elecampane, and migrach, which is the root of wild pomegranate, each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes, each 5 drams; alochil 20 drams; all should be ground and sifted and mixed with aloe water or egg white if the patient's complexion is warm; and then use this poultice, because it is well-composed and easily restores broken bones, and is suitable for many people.
Another method of poultice which helps with fractures and twists: take migrach and marshmallow root each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes each 5 drams; acacia 6 drams; Armenian bole 20 drams.
All should be ground in a mortar until well crushed, sifted, mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
Method of poultice for joints and bones separated from their places, to relieve pain in them and for fissures and fractures: take dirty wool, submerge it in sour wine and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.
But in this poultice there is no restorative virtue, it does not treat abscesses and properly expels pains.
Another method of poultice that restores broken bones: take leaves of a wild fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; grind them all and make a poultice from them.
Method of a quick poultice administered for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile and violet flowers, flour of vetch, each part equal; all should be ground and cooked with wine, if the limb is not warm.
But if it is warm, then make it with water from wet coriander or water and use it.
Another method of a stronger poultice for resolution than the first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and pomegranate peel, sweet clover, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, each part equal; all should be ground and cooked with willow water or sweet water or wine, all according to the quality of the limb and the rest of its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except for a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommended that it be of medium thickness and consistency.
But in Gaul it has been seen that substances with drying properties and a little warmth, like myrrh, incense, and similar things we have mentioned, are placed on the broken limb during its restoration.
Method of a poultice that relieves injury and pain: take breadcrumbs, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; all should be ground and sifted and cooked, and made into a poultice.
But the quantity according to which the binding should remain and then be loosened is that you consider if no pain or itching occurs and the bone is not broken or out of place, then do not loosen it for many days. And if severe pain or itching or swelling occurs in the area, then immediately loosen it and remove the poultice.
And take a linen cloth and a damp sea sponge, submerge it in warm water, and use it to wash the area until the itching stops and the pain subsides; then let the limb rest for an hour; then place dirty wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil on it, and bind it for a night until you are sure there is no abscess, and the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has gone away.
And then repeat that gentle binding and small poultice and do not tighten it as much as you did at first, and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, and swelling and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need a poultice and binding, then repeat it just as you did at the beginning in the same manner.
And if none of those symptoms occur in the limb, then do not loosen it for three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to how it appears to you by the binding of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh begins to coagulate over it.
And then adjust the binding more than your initial binding, and adjust the patient's diet, as previously mentioned.
But if you see that the fracture site is drying and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is not reaching it; and then wash it with warm water every time you loosen it; and do this every three days; and slightly loosen the binding, and through this operation, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal more easily.
But what foolish bone-setters do when the fracture is not set properly from the beginning, and it heals crookedly, is a mistake according to their operation, and a great fear, and if it were correct, the Ancients would have mentioned it in their books and worked with it.
And I have not seen any of them do this, which is why it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On Fracture When It Occurs in the Head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct. Some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the impact breaks the bone all the way to the membrane beneath it, like cutting into wood. This type is called 'ascial.' Or the sword cuts part of the bone and the flesh but does not go all the way through. This type of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta.'
And the wound from these two fractures can be large or small. There are also fractures caused by crushing or grinding, from a blow with a rock or a fall onto a stone, and similar causes.
And this fracture can either penetrate deeply, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it can be on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small.
And there is a type of fracture that is hidden within the bone, as thin as a hair, and thus this type is called a 'capillary fracture.'
And there is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone and similar impacts, which causes a piece of bone to press inward, creating a concavity as happens when a bronze pot is struck and its surface is pushed inward.
This happens mostly in soft bones, like the heads of children.
All these types of fractures create fragments, like pieces separated into stars. I will return to explain all this in its proper place.
We identify all these types of fractures by examining them and probing them with tools and observing any decayed flesh over them.
A capillary fracture is identified by cleaning and rubbing the bone with a probe, making the fracture appear black.
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the symptoms of the patient. If you see symptoms indicating severe distress, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging eyes, and redness of the eyes, and similar severe symptoms, there is no doubt the patient will not recover.
If you see no severe symptoms, you can hope for recovery and start the treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you in the early stages of the injury, and it is winter, you should examine the bone by the fourteenth day according to all conditions.
If it is summer, you should hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is beneath the bone is corrupted by the membrane, and before the symptoms we mentioned occur.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and has small fragments and abrasions, you should cut the crushed and abraded part, as I will explain to you.
You should shave the head of the injured patient, expose the bone according to the customary manner and according to the shape of the wound, and do this gently on the patient.
If, after exposing the bone, you encounter blood flow or a hot abscess, you should treat it by filling the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and ensure the blood flow is controlled; then start working around the bone and removing it.
This should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow chisel, and this is its shape: then use another chisel that is a little wider than the first; and this is its shape:
Then use a chisel that is wider than the second one.
You should have a number of different chisels, some wider than others; some shorter than others, with the tips of their ends sharp, made of Indian iron or steel.
Use them gently, striking the chisel in such a way that it does not shake the head or injure it.
If the bone is strong and hard, you should first drill around it before using the chisels with the augers, which are called non-penetrating augers.
They are called non-penetrating augers because they do not go through the entire thickness of the skull, as the auger has a rounded tip or margin that prevents it from sinking too deep and passing through the bone.
It is advisable to have a large number of these augers, each suited to the thickness of the respective bones, so that you have on hand the right one for each part of the skull, the tip of which should be sharp, and the length and shortness should match the thickness of that part of the skull.
This is the form of three types of augers: The quality of drilling around the fractured bone is to place the auger on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then move the auger to another place, and leave between each hole the amount equal to the thickness of the ray or around that.
Then cut with chisels what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible to facilitate removal, as we said, until you can extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other tool such as forceps or fine pliers prepared for this purpose.
Take care that the chisel does not touch any part of the membrane.
Then when you have drilled around the bone and it is separated from the membrane if it was attached to it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the rough edges of the bone with another tool similar to a chisel, but it should be thicker and finer than the other chisels.
If any small bone fragments remain, remove them carefully with the tools at hand; then treat the wound with ointments and bandages as we have described.
The other method of operation is lighter, free from fear, as described by Gualia and praised greatly; his teaching is: you must first uncover the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious until you have exposed that part and placed beneath it the end of this gentle and precise chisel, which has this shape:
The lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part extends on both sides longitudinally, like this; the lenticular part is placed against the membrane, with the sharp face cutting into the bone.
Then, strike the chisel gently with a small mallet until you cut through the bone easily as it is turned, ensuring the membrane is not harmed by any accident you fear, even if the healer was the most foolish and ignorant of men, or even if he was asleep.
If any part is attached to the bone in some places, separate it with the lenticular chisel tip, releasing it easily, without harm or fear.
If the fracture does not penetrate the membrane, and what is cut or removed is the bone's surface, leaving rough edges and fine fragments, then you should scrape those rough edges and remove the fragments with fine razors, for which you have prepared various sizes, so you can use the most appropriate one for each place, based on the requirements of your operation on the broken bone and its shape.
You should start with the widest razor and then use the finer one, continuing until you reach the finest and thinnest razor of all.
But in all other small fractures and subtle fractures, you should treat according to what is needed to correct them.
This is a method known to all who have studied this art. I will stand by what we have written and shown for major fractures.
If the membrane is intact when you remove the bone, take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, folded or tripled, soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to burden the membrane; then apply a wide bandage, but do not tighten it, only enough to hold the wound.
Leave it with this care for a day or two until you are sure there is no pus; then untie it and apply medicines that have drying properties, such as linseed roots and barley flour, and powder of incense and aristolochia, and similar things.
Make a powder from these medicines to sprinkle on the wound, as they are dry; generally, apply any medicine that cleanses and does not irritate.
Ensure according to your ability that the wound remains clean during treatment; do not let it become dirty with ointment or anything else; do not let any virulence accumulate in it; for when it is on the brain membrane, it corrupts it, causing rot, and leads to severe complications for the patient.
This occurs in the head membrane when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, and it blackens on the surface; then consider if the patient experiences the symptoms we have mentioned, knowing it is harmful beyond doubt.
If the blackening is not due to the medicine applied on top, and it is the medicine that causes it, then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, soak a cloth with them, and place it on the membrane; then treat it with the appropriate healing methods until it is healed.
Chapter 3:
On the Restoration of the Nose when it is Broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in the two uppermost parts, or sometimes one of them, because it has two bones, while the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break but may suffer abrasion, twisting, and curvature.
But if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into their nose and align the fracture from inside with your index finger and from outside with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you must align it with the tip of a small rod.
If the fracture is in two parts, you must do the same for both.
Try to restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; if not, then within seven or ten days after ensuring no pus forms.
Insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two tampons if the fracture is in two parts, and make the tampon thick enough to fill the nasal cavity.
Some ancient restorers say that the tampons should be soaked in vinegar and changed daily, but I have not seen this; rather, the cloth should be soaked in egg white mixed with flour, and left in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
Sometimes, instead of a tampon, insert goose feather wrapped in linen, especially for more severe nose fractures, ensuring it does not obstruct the patient's breathing.
This is not necessary; if you prefer, use this method, or use tampons.
If an abscess forms, plaster the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.
If no abscess forms, apply a plaster externally with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white; then place cotton over it, but do not bind the nose for any reason.
But if the nose bones are broken with a small fracture or are shattered, you must incise over them, extract them with appropriate instruments; then suture the incision, and treat it with substances that heal and solidify, and with suitable plasters.
If a wound forms inside the nose, treat it with tampons and insert lead canulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4:
On the Restoration of the Jaw when it is Broken.
When the lower jaw is broken without a wound, if the fracture is only external and not split into two, and is bent inward, it is easily recognized.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient’s mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert your right index finger; push the bulge of the fracture inward easily to the outside with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently align it.
If the jaw fracture is already split into two, administer extension of both parts in a straight line until it is possible to align them.
If the teeth are dislocated or disrupted, tighten those you hope will stay in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk; then place cerate over the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth, and over the cloth a large, properly made splint, or a piece of sole the length of the jaw; bind it appropriately so it stays secure.
Instruct the patient to rest and keep calm, and provide them with liquid food.
If you think the shape has altered in any way, untie it on the third day; then correct the alteration and apply plaster with flour, egg white, or sesame flour, after removing the cerate, and place cotton over the plaster.
Once the plaster is set and the bone’s position is not altered, leave it in place until it is healed and the fracture is secured, which often happens within three weeks.
If another abscess forms, apply the same treatments we mentioned for healing until it is completely healed.
If the fracture involves a wound, check if a piece of bone is separated or splintered, then delicately remove the splinters with appropriate instruments.
If the wound opening is narrow, enlarge it with a phlebotomy instrument as needed.
After removing the splinters, if nothing remains, suture the wound if it is wide; if not, apply a suitable plaster to heal it until it is fully healed.
Chapter 5:
On the Restoration of the Collarbone when it is Broken.
Often the collarbone breaks in front near the muscle, and this fracture happens in one of three ways.
It can either be broken, separated, or split into two parts without splinters; this is easy to restore; or it can involve splinters, making restoration difficult; or it can be with a wound.
In cases without a wound, have two assistants present, one to hold the assistant and the broken collarbone, and the other to extend the neck towards the fracture.
Align the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any bulges or concavities.
If more extension is needed, place a pad of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, of appropriate size; extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.
If you cannot pull the collarbone outward because it is pressing against the skin, the patient should lie on their back, and you should place a small cushion under the muscle of the affected side.
The assistant should press the muscle downward until the collarbone is elevated from the skin, then you can correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters from the collarbone and they are stuck, you must make an incision over it and easily remove the splinters.
If they are stuck in the bone, make an incision with one of the incising instruments you have prepared for this, after placing under the collarbone the instrument that serves the ciphac; it is a wooden or iron instrument shaped like this:
It resembles a spoon with this concavity; its width should match your need, depending on the bone's size or narrowness.
Its length should be suitable for your operation, with two ends, one wide and the other narrow.
If the incision made to remove the splinters is wide and you are sure of no pus forming, suture the wound's lips.
If the incision is small or you fear pus formation, fill the wound with cloth and powders as needed.
If an abscess forms, soak cloth in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, and place it on the wound.
Ensure the splint stays in place over the broken bone; check the patient daily, and if the binding loosens or the splint moves, correct and tighten it.
When the patient sleeps, place a small pillow under their head to elevate the injured side, lifting the broken collarbone. Alternatively, tie their arm to their neck.
Do not remove the binding unless there is swelling or an abscess, for twelve days.
Renew the plaster if needed, adjust the binding, and leave it until the fracture is healed and solidified.
The fracture usually stabilizes and strengthens within 28 days, though it can take less time in some people.
Chapter 6:
Restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken in its central part and not in the margins but the edges.
So, when the fracture is in the middle of the blade and is only detectable by touch, you must prepare and reduce it according to the natural shape in every way possible.
Then, place on the area powdered flour with egg white and wool; then place a folded cloth; and then place a thin wooden splint according to the size of the shoulder blade or slightly more.
But if there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that concavity with wool and adjust the splint accordingly.
Then tighten with a long bandage with appropriate constriction and firmness of the splint so it does not move from its place.
Check the bandaging every day; whenever it becomes loose, re-bandage and tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved.
Make the patient lie on their healthy side.
The shoulder blade will be restored in 20 or 25 days.
When this time is completed, then remove the bandaging, knowing that the shoulder blade is one of those bones whose healing is not feared nor its dissolution.
And if any piece of bone protrudes and pricks under the skin, then cut over it, remove it, and treat as we have mentioned in the fracture of the collarbone if this condition occurs.
Chapter 7:
Restoration of a chest fracture.
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this often happens; but its edges are very often crushed and fragmented.
And one of the accidents of a middle fracture is that it leans inward, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.
The restoration involves having the patient lie on their back and placing a cushion between their shoulders; then press the muscles, adjust the ribs with hands on both sides, and work gently in the operation and alignment in every possible way until the bone's shape is restored.
Then place a plaster and wool on it, followed by a thin wooden splint made of willow or similar light wood, wrapped in cloth; gently bandage it over the broken bone so it does not move; wrap it round the back several times, and tighten it decently; check the bandage regularly and tighten it when it loosens.
If a need arises to remove the bandage due to erosion, itching, pain, or abscess, quickly remove it, clean the plaster, rectify the situation with appropriate treatment, and then replace the plaster and tighten it until it heals.
Chapter 8:
Restoration of fractured ribs.
Know that rib fractures occur only in thick parts near the back; fractures in the front do not happen because they are cartilaginous. Detection of a fracture is not hidden from touch with fingers.
Restoration involves aligning the fracture with fingers as much as possible until it is set, then plastering and tightening the broken bone with a splint, if needed.
If the rib fracture leans inward, the patient will have severe pain and puncture similar to pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane; causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is hard to cure.
The Ancients have worked on this with many inventions.
Some said the patient should eat foods that cause bloating and gas, so the abdomen swells and the fracture is pushed outward.
But we avoid this as it may cause an abscess, and if it happens, it is helpful.
Some said to use a cupping glass to suck forcefully; this seems reasonable but feared to draw impurities to the area due to weakness.
Some said the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil, with padding between the ribs to fill it, wrapped with bandages in a rounded manner; and the patient should be treated as for pleurisy with diet and medicine.
If severe pain constrains the patient, with the bone puncturing the membrane and causing distress, cut over the area, expose the broken rib, use the instrument to hold the diaphragm (mentioned earlier), cut the bone, and extract it.
Then align the wound edges if large, with stitching, and treat with plasters until healed.
If an internal abscess occurs, quickly apply soaked pads in rose oil to the area, and treat the patient appropriately for the internal abscess.
Have the patient lie on the side they usually sleep on until healed.
Chapter 9:
Restoration of spinal fractures and neck bones.
Sometimes the bones of the neck fracture, often by pressure, and similarly with the spine. When this happens, and you want to know if it will heal, consider: if the patient's hands are softened, stupefied, and lifeless, unable to move, extend, or grip, and when you press or prick with a needle, there is no pain, then know it will not heal, and this condition is mostly fatal.
If there is movement and sensation when pressed or pricked, then know the spinal cord is intact, and the patient will recover with treatment.
If the same occurs with neck vertebrae, and you want to know if it will heal, examine the patient's feet.
If the feet are softened and experience the same as the hands, and when lying on their back, the patient passes gas and stool involuntarily, or if they try to urinate and cannot, know it is fatal, and do not attempt treatment.
If none of these conditions occur, the prognosis is better and easier.
The treatment involves sedating the inflamed area by applying rose oil alone or with yolks of roasted eggs several times a day until the inflammation subsides.
Then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, bandage tightly, and advise the patient to rest and avoid lying on the painful side until healed.
If a bone fragment or cause is separated from the pressure, cut over the area and remove the bone; align the wound edges with stitching if large; then treat with healing ointments until healed.
If the last vertebra is broken and at the end of the tailbone, insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with the other hand as possible; then apply plaster and splint if needed, and tighten.
If you feel broken fragments, cut over them, remove, and treat the wound as previously described until healed.
Chapter 10:
Restoration of hip fractures.
The hip bones rarely break, but when they do, the fracture is usually at the ends, extending lengthwise and inclining inward, causing pain and puncture in the area, and the leg becomes stupefied.
The restoration involves extending your hand over the fracture to align it as it should be.
If the fracture is only at the end, align it as much as possible until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture extends lengthwise or inclines downward, have the patient lie on their belly until the fracture is prepared for restoration. Once aligned, apply plaster, then a wooden or leather splint, and tighten without fearing fracture puncture or splint movement.
Fill any concavity to maintain even pressure, and advise the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.
If an abscess occurs, stop extending and restoring until the abscess subsides; apply treatments to sedate it, then resume restoration and tighten as needed.
If bone fragments are present or comminuted, remove them.
Chapter 11:
Restoration of fractures of the elbow.
The elbow is what is between the elbow joint and the shoulder.
If it is broken, the restoration is done in one of two ways, the first being to take a flat piece of wood of moderate thickness shaped like this:
Tie two bandages at both ends and suspend it from a high place.
Have the patient sit on a chair and extend the broken arm over the wood until it reaches the middle, where the curvature of the wood attaches.
Then suspend a heavy object from it, or have an assistant extend it downward; the doctor aligns the fracture with their hands until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method involves the patient lying on their back, with the hand suspended by a bandage from the neck; instruct two assistants to hold above and below the fracture, each extending in their direction.
If you want stronger extension, tighten the bandage over the fracture with another bandage, and have each assistant extend in their direction.
If the fracture is near the end of the muscle, place half the bandage over the shoulder and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, place the bandage over that area and the elbow.
Align it easily without effort, and once properly aligned and applied, tighten unless an abscess occurs.
If an abscess occurs, leave the tightness until the seventh day, then apply dirty wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, then tighten again.
To tighten, apply plaster over the fracture, wrap it with a clean cloth, adjust the arm over the elbow, and place the hand open on the muscle.
Wrap and tighten the cloth around the elbow so that the arm acts as a splint, unless prevented by a broken bone.
Then use splints.
Place the widest and strongest splint over the fracture, with the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints extending three fingers beyond the fracture.
Tighten the splints with the bandage as described at the beginning of the chapter.
Ensure the bandage over the fracture is the tightest. The longer the fracture, the looser the bandage should be.
When positioning the splints and bandages as described, restore the limb to its proper alignment.
If you fear an abscess, leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day as described.
Check the bandage in all areas for three days to prevent itching or swelling, or the restriction of food to the limb due to excessive tightness; then adjust as needed.
If confident that none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about three days or more.
Have the patient sleep on their back with their hands on their stomach.
Place a wool-filled cushion evenly on the elbow, and regularly check that the limb's alignment and bandage are intact; adjust if necessary.
Feed the patient according to the prescribed order, starting with light food until tightening begins; then increase the food's substance.
The usual treatment for the elbow and leg takes forty days; then loosen, bathe, and apply ointments to heal.
If the fracture is severe, do not loosen the bandage and splints for thirty to sixty days.
Chapter 12:
Restoration of fractures of the arm.
The arm consists of two bones called the forearm bones; one is small, located near the thumb, and the other is larger, located near the little finger, on the lower side.
The larger bone often breaks alone or with the smaller bone.
When the small upper bone breaks, the restoration and healing are easier.
When the lower bone breaks, the fracture and healing are more difficult.
The worst case is when both bones break together.
If the small upper bone breaks, it is advisable for the doctor to apply gentle extension until it is aligned.
If the larger bone breaks, a stronger extension is needed.
If both bones break together, apply a much stronger extension.
The hand should be positioned with the thumb higher than the other fingers, resting on a cushion, and the patient sitting on a square seat.
Place a cushion in front at the appropriate height to avoid discomfort.
One assistant extends the lower part of the arm with their hand or a bandage, while another does the same for the upper part.
The doctor aligns the bone to restore it to the best possible position.
If there are bone fragments, you must place each piece in its proper location with your skill.
If a fragment appears separated and pierces the skin without hope of restoration, treat it as previously described.
If the fracture involves a wound, refer to the specific chapter on this and follow its treatment.
If an abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, moderately thick, and tighten it gently until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, apply a plaster made of powdered herbs and egg white, and use the widest and strongest splint over the fracture.
Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in major cases, whether one or both bones are fractured.
Then apply the bandage most tightly over the fracture, loosening it slightly above and below as mentioned earlier.
The cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the string used for tightening should be moderately thick, as described.
Check the limb and bandage regularly for a few days. If an issue requiring correction arises, such as itching, soak the limb in warm water until it subsides.
Leave the limb untightened until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone is misaligned, correct it with your skill.
Check if the tightness restricts nutrition to the limb; if so, loosen it slightly for a few days to allow nutrition flow, then retighten.
If none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about twenty days.
Suspend the patient's hand to encourage movement and have them sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture heals in thirty to thirty-two days, or even twenty-eight days, depending on the individual's constitution and vitality.
Chapter 13:
On the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures of the wrist and knuckles of the fingers are rare, and they usually experience wear and tear.
When a fracture or wear happens to the hand, the patient should sit squarely and place their hand extended in front of them.
An assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should align them properly.
Then, apply a plaster and cotton if there is no severe abscess, and place a splint according to the injury's location, wrapping it in a cloth.
If the fracture is on the inner side of the palm, create a cloth ball and instruct the patient to grasp it with the injured palm, securing it with a long cloth.
The splint should be padded with cloth to be gentle on the palm, and tighten it as necessary.
If the fracture is on the outer side, place a splint on top and another on the palm side to keep the hand open and straight, and secure it with a bandage wrapped between the fingers.
If a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles, especially the thumb, align and secure it properly with the palm, and if desired, place a small splint to elevate the fracture and prevent movement.
For fractures in other fingers, like the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align and bind them to the adjacent healthy finger, or bind all together, which is better, or place a small splint as described for the thumb.
In the restoration process, consider the possibility of severe abscess and address it appropriately, following the methods previously described.
Chapter 14:
On the restoration of fractures of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone often breaks and is identified by its misalignment forward and upward.
Restoration involves tightly bandaging the fracture and another bandage below it, with the patient lying face down.
An assistant should extend the entire bandage according to the injury's nature when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
If near the hip joint, place the bandage near the knee on the thigh so that the extension is upward, and another bandage below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, place the bandage near the knee and extend it downward.
The doctor should then align the bone with both hands to its natural position and ensure good alignment; then apply a plaster and bandage unless there is an abscess. If an abscess occurs, leave it for a few days until it subsides, then return to the treatment.
The bandage should be applied firmly, doubled two or three times, and any excess removed; then wrap the leg from the foot to the hip.
Place a long cloth between the thigh and leg near the knee, with the ends reaching the uppermost part of the leg, and wrap any excess cloth around the leg and thigh.
Place splints over the fracture on the thigh and another splint on the leg bone.
Fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to ensure firm bandaging.
Start with a tight bandage in the middle of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site, make the bandage looser and softer.
Extend the ends of the cloth to the lower parts, reaching the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints so the bandage stays in place.
Leave the bandage as it is, ensuring it doesn't cause corrosion, severe abscess, or swelling; if any such issues arise, quickly remove the bandage and correct the issue as described.
If there is a bone fragment, align it as much as possible; if not, remove it and treat it according to previous instructions until healed.
Sometimes this fracture of the thigh is supported with splints as described for the forearm and arm.
In this manner of restoration, the patient does not develop a limp; if restored alone without the other leg's support, the patient will likely limp.
Know that the thigh should be bandaged for 40 days, give or take, depending on the patient's constitution and other factors.
Chapter 15:
On the restoration of fractures of the kneecap.
Know that fractures of the kneecap are rare but often suffer wear and tear.
If a fracture occurs, it is usually a crack or break in its parts, either with or without a wound, identified by symptoms.
Restoration involves aligning the broken parts with the fingers until they are joined as much as possible with proper adjustment and ease.
Apply a plaster and a round splint if needed, and secure it with an appropriate bandage.
Consider all the conditions described for other fractures, such as severe abscesses, and address any complications appropriately until healed.
Chapter 16.
On the restoration of a broken leg.
You should know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is large and is called the leg bone; and the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And what happens with each type of fracture also happens to the two bones of the arm, and therefore the restoration is done similarly to the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is turned in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it is for reasons that are not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, alignment, and binding of the splints according to that alignment.
But it is necessary, if the leg fracture is extensive and has many splinters, that the extension is less and lighter, and ease it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is some operation over the arm, and it is when you align the splints and complete all your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the things which are usually placed on the ground, and they are made from palm branches; bind those of small thickness, and not those of the smallest ones, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the lowest part.
And then wrap around each cloth in two wrappings according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places, at both ends and the middle, because with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it stays in good position.
And a small wooden brace is already administered according to the length of the leg; and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement.
And it is especially necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when with it there is appropriate pain.
And then examine the leg daily and study it thoroughly, and guard it from abscess and swelling or other similar causes; and if any of these occur, then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and the toes.
The heel does not suffer fractures often; but the bones of the foot sometimes do; and fractures of the toes are rare, and they usually only suffer from bruising due to their position.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes these bones are elevated over one another, then the patient should place their foot on the ground as if walking.
And then place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and then press, and align them until they return to their places.
And then place a plaster and a compress on top, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
And then secure it to the foot with a decent bandage, after wrapping it with cloth and other necessary things.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the binding, because you will find the bones aligned, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if any toes are broken, then restore them, and align them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint on the broken toe according to the length of the toe, and make it a bit wider; and then under the foot place the board that was recommended to you, and secure it with a decent bandage.
But if what is broken are two or three or more bones, then place on each toe a splint of its size wrapped in soft cloth, and secure the board to the lower part of the foot, and let one of the ends of the board stand outside the arch of the foot to hold it in good retention.
And it is necessary for you not to forget to consider all the causes that have been mentioned to you in other fractures of the accidents we have
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pelvic bone and penis.
When the woman's pubic bone is broken, then make her sit in a square seat, and then incline her a little towards the back, and she should be held there.
And then the midwife fills the pubic area with cotton, and it should be made in the shape of a sphere; and then the woman should be shaken, and raise her back little by little, because all of this is pushed out until the front part of the pubic area is spherical and the broken bone returns.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and replace it and return it in the same way you placed it at the beginning, and then return to her original powder.
And do this for seven days or so, because that is the time needed for it to heal.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach to its opening a cane tube; and insert the entire bladder into the pubic area, and then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the pubic area, because the fracture will return.
And then fill it with cotton and let it stay for a few days as we have said, until it is healed.
And when the pelvic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in the restoration and alignment of it what we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures and which occur infrequently, especially to those who have some study and use and understand this book well; because that fracture shows you in the major dispositions a straight path in the restoration and alignment of it, so understand well.
But for the man's penis when it is broken, take goose grease, and place the penis in it; and then wrap it with cloth, and it should be bandaged, and then left for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19:
On the restoration of bone fractures with wounds.
It is suitable for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you act quickly and perform bloodletting immediately if the conditions for bloodletting justify it as we have previously mentioned.
And if the wound is bleeding, then you must quickly stop it by sprinkling powdered chalk on it if you have no other remedy available.
And then begin to restore the fracture on the same day, and do not delay this unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess occurs, then delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, as this could cause bad complications.
But if the broken bone is protruding through the skin, then you must forcibly reduce and align it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.
But if the extension and alignment cannot be done with your hands alone, then reduce it with this instrument; it is an iron tool, seven or eight fingers long and its width according to the size of the wound; and it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these according to what is needed for the treatment of each type of fracture.
And it should be round and slightly thick so that it does not bend under compression during the operation.
And it should have a sharp end with a margin at the extremities; and its upper part should be of increasing thickness from the middle towards the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, which means small spatula.
So the sharp end should be placed over the protruding end of the bone.
And push it in one movement until the bone returns, and it is aligned properly.
And then strive to align the fracture ends together, and if the broken end is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with a suitable instrument as we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away the remaining roughness and small scales from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, if the patient experiences severe pain afterwards, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this because you will give the patient great relief.
When you have completed the restoration of the bone, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place a plaster or anything containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause rot and corruption.
And then apply splints during the completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can make incisions with scissors and use wrappings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this, causing their patients death or corroding disease or severe inflammation. And let your bandaging be light, soft, and different from the bandaging of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a severe wound, and you fear any of the bad complications we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then you should not place splints over it, but wrap it with hard cloths instead of splints and secure it with them.
And after a day or two when the wound starts to form a scab, then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine, and then apply dressings and ointments with which we usually treat wounds, like tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.
And you must loosen the bandage and examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and firm, and the limb must be positioned in such a way that any rot drains away from it easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated and the scab has not separated from it, then know that there are small fragments which you must search for in the wound with a probe. And remove and extract those fragments that are separated, and for those that are not separated and are causing pain and inflammation, you must incise them as much as is possible for you.
And if the wound develops pus or discharge, such as abscesses, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, then you must treat each of them with the appropriate remedies whose treatment has been previously described in its chapter.
And this is where my discourse must stay and you present your practice: when a large bone is broken, protruding over the limb like the thigh bone or the humerus and similar large limb bones, do not presume to pull or extract it because this often causes death; instead, leave it until it decays, as it will likely fall off by itself in around 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20:
On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Many times this swelling occurs at the site of a healed fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it often prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply astringent medicines such as aloe, incense, myrrh, Serapias, and aristolochia, or similar; so take some or all of these and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply it to the swelling with tow, and compress it well.
And leave the bandage in place without loosening it for many days; then loosen it and reapply another until the swelling is reduced; or compress it with a lead plate, because lead has the property of removing all swelling from limbs.
But if the swelling has already hardened and is tight, and it is necessary to remove it quickly, then cut it at the uppermost part, and incise the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with some rasp until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21:
On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed and the limb remains thin and fragile, not in its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains thin and fragile, this is due to several causes: one of which is the large number of bandages and their incorrect application; or excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive embrocation; or excessive movement not at the right time; or lack of blood in the patient’s body and their weakness.
The cure for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until their blood increases; and administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural state.
Chapter XXII
On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and inhibit their proper function.
When it happens that a healed limb becomes crooked or prominent at the broken bone and swelling, and the shape of the limb is thus altered, but the limb is not inhibited from its natural function, you should not take the word of someone who thinks the limb is newly broken.
But there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, causing great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the crookedness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, mallow, and similar ones; and a poultice should be made with a softening plaster like well-made dyallachilon; or marshmallow root mucilage mixed with hen's fat or cerate oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs mashed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances that are named for consolidating.
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent gentle rubbing with wet hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has advanced and become hard and turned into a bony mass, and it needs surgical treatment, then the top layer must be scraped off and the continuity of the bone disrupted, and the excess swelling of the bone itself should be incised with fine instruments, and this should be done with care and diligence.
Chapter XXIII
On the discussion of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, preventing movement, and deforming the shape of the limb, causing the patient great pain and injury.
So when a dislocation happens to someone, it must be immediately forced back, and not delayed, because if delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and very soon it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.
Therefore, it should not be handled or stretched during the time of inflammation, because it often causes spasms and severe pain.
But when this happens, you must quickly perform bloodletting on the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be treated with warm water and oil, and it will be easily reduced.
And every limb should be treated with the remedies appropriate for it, as will be described in their respective chapters.
And I have already organized the chapters on dislocation as preceded by the chapters on fractures; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowest part.
Chapter XXIV
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are dislocated if they do not close properly; and the dislocation of both is caused in one of two ways: either they are slightly out of place and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated and entirely out of place, causing looseness at the joint, making the patient's saliva flow uncontrollably and preventing them from closing their mouth, and their speech is affected.
But when the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place by itself with minimal cause.
But if the dislocation is complete and entire, then the reduction must be performed gently and without delay.
The procedure involves the assistant holding the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the dislocated side of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side; or inserts both thumbs together if both sides are dislocated, with the other fingers outside to grip; and instructs the patient to relax their jaw and move it from side to side; the physician then aligns the jaw and pushes it back into place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply steam with warm water and oil, making the reduction easier, and do not delay in reducing both as previously mentioned.
Once they are returned and aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not loosened, then place on them cloth dusted with a plaster made of wax and rose oil; and gently bind it with soft bandages.
The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so it doesn't turn to the right or left; do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be liquid until the pain subsides and the jaws are set, then they can chew what they want.
This should be managed with ease, and do not stress the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when dislocated and they are not returned to their place, then often this causes fever and persistent sweating, and soon the patient's stomach becomes upset, and they frequently vomit pure bile.
When you see this, know that it is a bad sign; and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter XXV
On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated inward due to its connection with the chest; but sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is felt by touch.
The reduction is done by having the patient lie on their back and extend their arms. Then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to place.
Then apply a plaster and powder to the area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity that follows the elbow and is connected to it is not easily dislocated; when it is, it must be reduced and aligned as previously described and according to the method prepared.
Then apply a plaster, powder, and binding, and instruct the patient to remain tranquil and at rest until it is healed.
And the same treatment is applied to the muscle extremity when it is separated from its place.
Chapter XXVI
On the reduction of dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated downward towards the armpit.
The second is that it is dislocated upward, which happens rarely; it is not dislocated backward towards the shoulder blade, nor is it dislocated forward towards the nerves.
It is mostly dislocated outward and downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, where it dislocates easily; but in those with more flesh, it is more difficult to dislocate.
Often, due to a blow or fall, the muscle becomes inflamed and is mistaken for a dislocation.
Therefore, you must ascertain this before being certain, and then proceed with the treatment.
The dislocation is recognized when it is downward towards the armpit; you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle by noting a noticeable difference; you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the armpit towards the muscle head's touch like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear or move it in all directions.
If it is dislocated towards the chest or upward, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
This dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent and the patient is a child.
The reduction involves the assistant raising the patient's hand upwards; then placing the thumbs below the armpit, and lifting the joint forcefully to its place, raising the patient's hand and extending it upwards; then gently resting it as it returns easily.
But if it does not return as we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and given a poultice to soften and relax as if it were made from marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be applied.
Then the patient should lie on their back and a woolen pad of moderate firmness be placed under the armpit, and the doctor places their heel on the pad, lifting the muscle head forcefully, and pulling the patient's hand to prevent downward movement, while another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent downward movement, so it returns to its place quickly.
If you prefer, reduce it this way: have a person taller than the patient stand on the side and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand downward from their abdomen. But if the patient is light, they should be suspended with additional weight, so it adds enough weight, causing the dislocation to return quickly.
Another easy method is to place a long wooden pole on the ground with a round top, like a pestle, not too thick or thin, and place it under the patient; then cover the top of the pole with soft cloths, have the patient lie along the length of the pole, and extend their arm downward from the other side; and stretch their body on the opposite side forcefully, so the joint returns to its place quickly.
If reducing it is difficult despite all the mentioned methods, use this method: take a wooden pole about two arms long, four fingers wide, and its thickness reduced under the armpit according to this shape:
Then wrap the round top with soft cloth so the pole does not hurt the patient.
Then place it under the patient's armpit, and extend their hand or arm over the pole downward, and tie the pole around the support and the arm and hand extremity.
Then place the arm on a step of a ladder horizontally, extending the hand downward, and suspend the body on the other side, so the joint repositions quickly.
Once the repositioning is complete by any method possible for you, place a wool pad of equal size under the armpit; then apply a poultice made of ground flour mixed with vinegar and egg white over the whole muscle, wrapping it, and bandage it tightly under the armpit; the bandage should be wrapped over the poultice, and the hand attached to the neck, leaving it immobile for seven days.
The patient's food intake should be limited until the limb is strengthened, as this aids in recovery.
Afterward, increase the food intake gradually after seven or five days and encourage some movement; if it stabilizes without softening, then it is healed.
But if the joint frequently dislocates due to humidity or other causes, then it should be treated with cauterization with three burns, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
If after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not stable, and the poultice and bandage have been reapplied several times without success, and the arm cannot be raised upwards, know that the nerves at the muscle head are either cut, stretched, or softened, and the joint will never be set in its place.
For the dislocation towards the chest and the breast or the back parts, reduction is done by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.
Apply the other bandage to it, and treat it until it is healed.
If after healing, the limb feels heavy and movement is slow, the patient should take frequent baths until the heaviness is relieved and the limb returns to its original state.
Chapter XXVII
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it dislocates in all directions, mostly forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you as it is felt beneath the clothing or touch in whatever shape it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clear to you, as the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch the muscle with it.
You must act quickly and reduce the dislocation before it becomes an inflamed abscess, for if it turns into an inflamed abscess, it is difficult to reduce, and it does not heal easily; especially when it is backward, as it is the worst type of dislocation, with the most pain, and often leads to death.
The restoration, when it is possible to reduce, is done by extending the hand with both hands, and the arm stretched out, with the doctor's hands on the elbow above and below, pushing the joint with the thumbs together, or with the palm's edge until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, then it is returned by bending the hand with one's own hand until the elbow is struck with the palm's edge.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
Two assistants should extend the arm, holding it firmly so it is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm should be turned in all directions after being wrapped in a long cloth or bandage.
When the doctor touches the joint with their hand, they should oil it to facilitate lubrication and ease, then push the joint forcefully until it returns.
After reduction, a poultice with astringency and drying properties mixed with egg white should be applied, bandaged tightly, and the arm suspended from the neck, left for several days.
Then it should be unwrapped; if the joint is stable in its place, the bandage can be removed and left off.
If the joint does not seem stable, reapply the poultice and bandage, leaving it for several days until it stabilizes; then unwrap it again.
If heaviness occurs after joint reduction, and movement is difficult, administer moistening baths, gentle rubbing, and compression until relieved; or apply fat-tail sheep’s rump, which is very fatty, to the joint; bandage it, and leave it on the bone day and night. Then remove it, bathe the joint; when dry, rub it with gentle friction, and reapply the fat-tail sheep’s rump, doing this once, twice, and three times, the corruption has already come over the knee from the bath entry, until it is smooth.
If you wish, apply a humid and heated cow's spleen to the joint, pressing it on; do this several times, as it is moist and helps restore its condition.
Chapter XXVIII
On the treatment of wrist dislocation, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike other joints, but it is important to reduce it quickly before it becomes an inflamed abscess.
The reduction is done by placing the patient’s wrist on a table, with an assistant extending the hand, while the doctor presses on the joint prominence with his hand or palm, pushing until it returns to its place.
However, if the palm is already facing the forearm, the patient should place the back of the hand on the table for extension and reduction; if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, the hand should be positioned palm down on the table so the doctor’s hand can press on the joint prominence.
If it returns quickly, it is good; if not, then apply a poultice to prevent abscess and leave it; do not repeat this, as it may not endure further reduction attempts.
But if the joint remains twisted, it does not harm the patient except the hand becomes weak and cannot grip; then know the nerves are cut or bruised, and the only remedy is cauterization near the injury, which may help somewhat.
Once the wrist is returned, apply the poultice as recommended, leave it and bandage it for five days; then remove the bandage and exercise the hand.
But if movement is restricted and heaviness occurs, relieve it with warm water and gentle rubbing several times until it is alleviated.
Chapter XXIX
On the treatment of finger dislocation.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in various directions.
When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the finger tip and suspend it towards the dislocated direction, leaving it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
At night, bandage it as described, and during the day, unwrap and exercise it, rebandaging it at night; do this for several days until it is stable.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm, bandaging it in that direction and performing the initial treatment until it is healed.
Similarly, do the same when dislocated in other directions.
Chapter XXX
On the treatment of spinal dislocation.
When a complete dislocation of any spinal vertebra or neck vertebra occurs, and many vertebrae are displaced, there is no cure, as death quickly follows.
A sign of this is involuntary excretion, and inability to retain it; often some limbs become paralyzed, such as both legs, both arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is displaced, which sometimes shifts to four directions.
This displacement to the back is called kyphosis.
But treatment depends on whether kyphosis occurred in childhood, as then there is no cure or complete recovery.
But for kyphosis caused by injury or trauma, the Ancients have described detailed treatment methods, which mostly provide benefit; I have summarized these to avoid excessive detail, while aligning with my intent to explain, forming a diverse set of instruments to demonstrate and apply them.
Only kyphosis in the back can be treated with the method I will describe.
The patient should lie face down on a level place near a wall, with a soft pad underneath to avoid chest injury.
A straight post should be placed upright in the ground at the head of the patient’s place, and another at the feet.
One assistant holds the post at the head, without fixing it in a hole, and another holds the one at the feet similarly.
Then wrap a strong band around the patient’s head and under the armpits; extend it to the post at the head and tie it there; similarly, tie another band around the hips and thighs, and secure it to the post at the feet.
Each assistant then tightens the bands towards the posts; the posts and bands remain in place, not firmly fixed as described.
The doctor then presses the vertebra with his palms firmly until it returns, or places a board over it and applies pressure with his feet until it returns.
If it does not return this way, use a board about three cubits wide or long, and make a hole in the wall near the patient where the end of the board fits. Then place half of the board over the vertebra, and the doctor applies pressure with his feet on the other end, tightening it until the vertebra returns to its place.
If preferred, use a turning device operated by hand; place two posts, each a cubit long, in the ground near the patient's head and another two at the feet, with a space of one palm's width between each; make holes in each post for a rotating rod, firmly fixed in the ground.
Insert a round rod for the rotating device through the holes in the two posts.
At the end of the rod, there is a hole to fit a handle one palm long for turning; the other two posts have similar holes.
Tighten the bands from the patient's chest into the holes near the head, and the bands from the thighs into the turning device near the feet.
Each assistant turns the device by hand while the doctor adjusts the vertebra as described.
Once the vertebra is returned and the position corrected, apply a drying poultice with egg white, then wool; place over the poultice a splint from a board three fingers wide or so, long enough to cover the kyphosis area, and over the healthy part of the spine.
Bandage it as described, and let the patient use light nourishment until healed.
If any prominence remains at the end of healing, administer softening medicines and use the board treatment for a long time as recommended; sometimes a lead sheet is applied.
Sometimes a prominence appears behind the spinal vertebrae, mistaken for dislocation; this bone prominence should not be treated with this method, as it can quickly lead to death.
Chapter .31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
You should know that the hip joint and the muscle joint only suffer dislocation, and they are not affected in the same way as other joints with slight displacement and concavity.
The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: inward, outward, forward, or backward.
It is mostly dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.
The sign of inward dislocation is when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, which is swollen due to a severe abscess because the femoral head has moved there.
The sign of outward dislocation is that the symptoms are opposite to those of inward dislocation.
The sign of forward dislocation is that the leg extends normally but cannot be bent without pain in the knee; if forced to walk, the patient cannot move forward, their urine is retained, the groin is swollen, and they walk on their heel.
The sign of backward dislocation is that the knee cannot be extended or bent forward towards the groin, the affected leg is shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the femoral head is at that location.
But the reduction of these types of dislocations depends on whether the dislocation is old and longstanding; if it has become chronic, the reduction and retention of it in its place is not effective, so it should not be attempted.
But if the dislocation is recent and is one of the four types, then promptly return the joint by extending it inward and outward, moving it right and left, as it quickly returns to its place and no further treatment is needed.
But if it does not return in this way, prepare a strong assistant to extend the patient's leg from below, either with their hands or with a band tied above the knee; another assistant extends the patient's arm so that their hands are under the armpits; then tighten a strong band around the thigh and have another assistant hold the end of the band.
Extend the leg either inward towards the groin or backward towards the back.
Extend all parts at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended.
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocations.
If the dislocation returns as we have described, it will be good; otherwise, specific treatments will be necessary for each type.
In the specific reduction for inward dislocation, the patient should lie on their healthy side; place the band around the thigh at the spot between the femoral head and the area below the groin; extend the band from the groin to the highest part of the shoulder.
Then, a strong assistant takes hold of the patient's arms, supports the upper part of the affected thigh, and extends it outward with strong traction, causing it to return to its place.
This type of treatment is easier and more effective for reducing this kind of dislocation than the other types.
But if you are uncertain and do not follow this method completely, tie the patient's feet together with a strong, light band around both heels and knees.
Each leg should be tied four fingers apart, with the affected leg extended two fingers more than the other.
Then suspend the patient by the head of the post in the house; the distance from the ground should be two cubits.
Instruct a strong young man to reduce the femoral head, and have another young man suspended with the patient, pushing with force so that the joint quickly returns to its place.
In the specific reduction for outward dislocation, the patient should lie on a cushion as previously described for the yellow disease; tightly wrap the band around the affected leg and chest.
Place two posts, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; then place posts in the middle of the cushion wrapped with damp cloths to prevent the patient from being harmed by the post between their thighs, ensuring that the extension is not pulled downward.
Each assistant extends their part, and the physician guides the reduction with their hand according to the art.
For forward dislocation, the leg should be gently extended in the same way on a cushion; the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected groin, compressing it with the other hand, and with this compression, extends it downward towards the knee.
For backward dislocation, the patient should not be extended downward but lifted from the ground; they should be placed on a hard surface, as described for outward dislocation, lying on their face with the bands extended as previously mentioned.
Apply compression with a board over the area where the joint protrudes.
When the reduction is properly done — the sign that it is successful is that both legs can be extended equally and the patient can flex and extend the affected leg without pain, indicating the joint has returned to its place — then adjust both thighs, apply a poultice and bandage tightly to keep the hip stable, and let the patient rest for three to four days.
Afterwards, remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
If the legs appear equal and stable, the dislocation is fixed, and the patient can be allowed to walk.
If there is any sign of softness, reapply the poultice and bandage it tightly as before, and leave it for three days.
Afterwards, remove it and allow the patient to walk gradually over a few days until they are fully strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outward, inward, and downward but mostly backward; it is not dislocated forward.
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to bend their leg at the knee; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
The method to restore any type of knee dislocation is to have the patient sit straight, extending their leg if they can; place your knees against their thigh, and put their foot between your feet; then place your palms on their knee, holding it firmly with your fingers, while another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of successful reduction is that the leg can be easily bent without pain.
Then apply a poultice and bandage the leg to the thigh, and wrap them together with a bandage for three to four days, and then unwrap them.
The patient should not walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if you cannot reduce the dislocation, then perform strong extension with the same bandages used in the hip treatment described earlier.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated, either inward or outward.
The sign of dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen towards the direction it is dislocated.
The treatment for a slight displacement is a gentle reduction, extending it easily with the hands until it returns.
For a complete dislocation, have the patient sit straight, with a strong assistant supporting their back from the middle.
Hold the upper part of the foot with your right hand and the lower part near the ankle with your left hand.
Pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and then extend it with the left; push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.
Do this twice as we have described.
Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg a third time, focusing on the ankle.
If the foot returns to its place once or twice in this manner and appears aligned, it is good; if not, repeat the procedure until it does.
But if you are unable to reduce the dislocation as described, lay the patient on their back on the ground, secure a block firmly to the ground, and place it between their thighs, wrapped with cloth to avoid injury.
Then one assistant holds the thighs, and another extends the foot with their hands or with a band tied around the ankle; each assistant pulls in opposite directions, while the block between the thighs holds the body steady to prevent it from being pulled down during the extension.
The physician aligns the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the healthy thigh downward, allowing the dislocation to return easily.
Once the dislocation is reduced and confirmed, apply a poultice and bandage it tightly, binding the foot to the leg.
Take care to avoid compressing the nerves behind the heel too forcefully to prevent damage.
Leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it.
Remove the bandage on the third or fourth day, and prohibit walking for 40 days. But if walking is necessary before this time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, preventing proper healing.
If an abscess occurs, treat it as previously described in another place with appropriate care and embrocation until it subsides.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocated toes.
A dislocated toe should be gently realigned without much effort; this is usually easy to do.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, have the patient sit with their foot on an even surface or table, as if they were standing.
Then stand and place your foot over the dislocated joints, pressing down firmly until they return to place, ensuring they are aligned and no swelling appears.
Then place a board under the sole of the foot to support it completely, securing it with a tight and firm bandage for three days; then remove the bandage and have the patient rest without walking for many days until it is stable and the reduction is confirmed.
Chapter 35.
On types of dislocation that occur with a wound or fracture or both together.
When any of these conditions occur, and you attempt to treat and restore it, often death ensues.
Therefore, only a skilled, experienced, merciful, and cautious practitioner, not rash or presumptuous, should attempt the treatment. Initially, use medicines that only alleviate painful abscesses and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless you have hope of recovery and alleviation of the disease, with some sign of hope. Then try to reduce the dislocation immediately at the onset, before a painful abscess develops.
If the limb returns to place as desired, administer treatment to alleviate the abscess and heal the wound with appropriate drying ointments.
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture with separated bone fragments, stabilize them and proceed as described earlier for such conditions.
Protect and avoid exposure to hazards as much as possible, as advised earlier; this is better for you before your Creator, more lasting for your glory, and healthier for your body in the long run. Thus concludes the words of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.
