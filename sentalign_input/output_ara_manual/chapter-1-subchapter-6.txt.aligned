On Cauterizing Lockjaw.	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.4377733
Lockjaw that is treated with cautery is only of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	0.6856512
Avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.	But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.67836225
When you have treated this type of lockjaw with irrigations, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, it is appropriate to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations. One at the base of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the joining of the lips.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	0.8773452
And make your cauterization on the side opposite the diseased side, because the relaxation will occur on the side that appears healthy.	Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	0.8230538
The method of cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.	The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.	0.76863253
Bring down your cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the image of the cautery, and it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has been presented previously, except that it is a little finer, as you see. The scalpel should be slightly thicker, then treat the area as mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.	The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness. Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	0.64146495
