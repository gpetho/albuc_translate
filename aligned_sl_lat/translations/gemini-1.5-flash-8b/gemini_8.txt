Having completed for you, my children, this book, which is the final treatise in medicine with its completion, and having reached its end through its explanations and its declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery, with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand is languishing in our region and in our time, entirely private, until perhaps its knowledge perished and its trace was severed, and nothing remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which changing hands have altered, and errors and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions were closed and its force withdrawn: it seemed to me that I should give it life again with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation, and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of the cautery, and of the other instruments of the work, with the addition of a declaration and the haste of what is necessary.
The reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is this: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has related, until he knows the aids of the limbs and their forms, and their joining and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, and their number, and their emergence, and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And therefore Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We, however, have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is not safe, but falls into error, by which people are killed; as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
This is because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess in the woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for his medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel; and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound an outlet.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Afterwards he dismissed him after a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage; and he remained like that until his leg and foot became suppurated, and it came to ruin.
Therefore, I was summoned to him, and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, corruption had already become established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess; and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its owner.
That is, because when the cancer is pure, from melancholy humour, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
And therefore, my children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with the hand, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have already raised up in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it and to divide it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it and dishonour it.
Therefore, receive your measurements with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy succession; and leave behind terrible illnesses of difficult healing; and remove your minds from that which causes you fear, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and your well-being. For it remains more to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your merits.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery; and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recount the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in which complexion it is to be applied.
I say therefore, that discourse on the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a matter of science and hidden secret.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; and for me, a small part of their words suffices, fearing length.
I say therefore, that the cautery benefits every complexion, whether with or without matter, except for two complexions, which are a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.
However, in a hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable in an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable for being cured of a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through cauterization benefit occurs in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I myself say through his words: because by experience it has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not appropriate for anyone to apply it to that unless they have already been proven and practiced in the final exercise of cauterization, and have known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes and accidents, and their time span.
However, there is no fear regarding the remaining complexions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have already agreed upon them, and have not disagreed on the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except for the limb that is cauterized: and it does not harm any other limb joined with it, except for a small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs, and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing, and perhaps kills, in the limb.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
However, this has now become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and our standing upon the truth of things; and because of that, I excuse myself from the length of this discourse.
And know, children, that they disagree as to the time when the cautery should be applied, and they place a better time in the spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm that is incidental to the time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn in with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness, because it is feared from them that a greater evil will occur than the slight harm that enters because of the time.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that which is feared only by the common people and foolish physicians, namely that the ailment which is cured by cautery does not always return. And they posit that as a consequence, but things are not as they think: because cautery is not, except in the place of a medicine, which alters the complexion and dries out the humidities which are the cause why pains occur.
However, cautery is superior to medicine by the swiftness of its health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its control. And it is possible that the illness may return at some hour of time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its power; and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him; and that which comes to him in his acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless it is an illness in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and humidities, like the cautery of a tooth, for pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's saying, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct statement; not to what they intend by it, because they believe that it is not a cure that compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the cautery has passed.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not the case, except that when we administer methods of treatment for some illnesses, and those medicines do not work, then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it works; then it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many unintelligent physicians.
The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless because of the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the cautery site does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so; because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you make cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the quantity you want, because of the redness of the gold; and when it rapidly approaches cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls from that occupation; and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, according to the straightness of the operation.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they will relieve the one seeking what he wants from it. On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of humidity and coldness over the brain; these two are the cause of headaches, and a multitude of discharges of humours from the head to the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally every illness that occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses to them.
The method of cauterization is, that you order the sick person: to be evacuated first with a cleansing liquid medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom demand.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger arrives, mark that place with caustic. Then the Olive Cautery, whose form is this. Then place him on the place marked with caustic, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn him.
Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones appear, which I have told you.
Then take something of salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak in it cotton, and place it on the place: and leave it three days.
Then place over it the cotton soaked in butter, and leave it over the place until the eschar of fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore, it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then that which has been burned from the bone should be scraped off, then treated.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the end with the cautery, until it makes an impression on the bone, such that the bone falls off, which occurs like the shape of a kirate; or an instrument that women use with a small infused alphabet; and they believe that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in certain individuals, according to a way of caution.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of the person.
For the head weakens from the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have observed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble. And indeed, the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, work with it for the sake of health.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head for pain throughout the whole head.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it prolongs itself in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head-cleansing, and oils, and emplastrum.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things help it, then consider.
For if the sick person's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and it finds severe cold, then cauterize it with another cautery a little beneath the first one.
Then cauterize it with a cautery on every horn of his head, so that the skin is not perforated and a quantity of bone is uncovered, as we have described.
And cauterize it with the one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the vessel; and it is a place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your cautery in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the sick person finds because of that a severe pain, and different from the pain of the other cauteries on all the head.
And I shall say this cautery is in its place: and it ought to be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery, with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, is applied, and it does not benefit entirely: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning sharp medicine, or with iron. The cautery with a burning sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then, incise the painful area with a wide lancet, until a space is made beneath the skin, in which the clove is placed.
Then introduce it into the space under the skin, until it is hidden; then bind it over it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic, and let the wound be for two or three days; afterwards place on it a compress soaked in butter, until the place forms pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written in the twelfth treatise, concerning Burning Medicines.
However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
The cautery iron, whose form is this.
And it is called a "nail" because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you should rotate the iron gradually with speed; and let the quantity burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak lint in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place lint with butter; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
And beware of incision into the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, with what we have said about the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if treatment is not helping; and you see from the illness that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it turns white, after marking the site of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or similar; and place your hand, in turn, and press it until you cut into the artery, and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the jaw, which moves during mastication, or the nerve that moves it, lest a spasm occur.
And be on guard and careful about the flow of blood from the cut artery.
For in its cutting is danger, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent nor experienced; and he abandons the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regulation of blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If, from the illness, you see that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have related, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Chapter VI. When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies and the rest of the treatment as we said in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then the points, after its ignition, with it, in a circling motion around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circling motion around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and approximately like that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture which is treated with cauterization is only from the species which arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the species that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head purgings, and gargles, and your treatment is of no avail, then you must cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower on the temporal region, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper earlobe, slightly under the horn of the head, and another on the temporal region, whose length should be equal to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from the knife, of the form mentioned previously; however, it is not a little more delicate than that, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife within it has a little excess thickness. Then treat the places, with what has gone before, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When the apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what has gone before; and the method of the cautery shall be according to what has gone before.
Also he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is more of a last resort.
Then let him be treated, with what has gone before.
Concerning the manner of cauterization in forgetfulness.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be first given to the sick person in a drink.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on his back of the head a plaster of synapis, as described in the treatise on plasters, and place it several times. For that is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order which I have stated there. If, therefore, he is healed by it, it is good.
If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery, with that which preceded it.
If, however, you wish for an addition, and the infirm one is capable of tolerating it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish for an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was previously mentioned.
On the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyerri and with that which we said.
Then shave the patient's head; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
However, if in the illness you require softening of the body with more than those, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with one cautery, until the most of its skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then care for him until he is healed: and thus is the cautery of Olive.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the remaining treatment which we have stated in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in accepting medications.
However, if it is a child, who does not tolerate medications, then a gargle and chewing motions that cleanse the brain are administered, many days before, with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has preceded in the method: and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on every horn of his head.
If however the sick person is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I spoke of in the case of paralysis, and the softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the method that has preceded. If however the sick person is a child, then place a fine cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humours and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have spoken of in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of the melancholy is an excess of the downward inclination to melancholy, and the sick person's body is moist, then give him in drink that which will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the sick person's head, and afterwards make a nicely made roll out of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sick person, sitting upright, is to be held firm on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over the fire with a moderate heat, which the finger can tolerate when it is placed inside.
Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small points on it, except that you should hold the hand with the cautery; indeed, let it be smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are shown the beginning of water in the eye by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and make the weak person drink it, with that which will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye only; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be of the same length as the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the skill that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient lachrymal diseases.
Chapter Fourteen.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, persistent, and are situated above the veins and arteries that are apparent on the outer head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I described at the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck beneath the two bones.
And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye's socket, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in nasal foulness.
Chapter Fifteen.
When you treat it, with what we said about division, and the treatment does not help, then quickly give the weak person cochlias in a drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a keyhole cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the keyhole cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side, and let them extend from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
And this is the shape of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped cautery method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the eyelashes are inverted and prick the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, first tell the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is of those who trim them, until they are lengthened and even. If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born.
When therefore they are born and are even, then place the sick person's head in your lap; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with ink a sign that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Then, apply the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the figure, which you marked gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore, raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place a compress with butter on it until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is to instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall out until they are extended and made even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, one ounce or approximately that amount of each; then grind them together with good rubbing, and do it quickly so that it does not cool down.
Then spread some of it from the mixture onto the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or two.
And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white; and let the sick person's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's bite, since its bite is found to be like fire.
While, therefore, this bite which he finds persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When, therefore, the bite subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid being lifted, as it is lifted with burning or incision, it is well; and if not, then again apply medicine to the place where the medicine does not take effect and does not darken, until your operation is equal to, and the eye is contracted.
Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphanicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during the operation, to observe the utmost care, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hairs fights in the eye, then apply medicine again to that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When treating a fistula, if your treatment, as we discussed in the divisions of diseases, is not helpful, then, you ought to cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an attendant hold his head between their hands so that it does not move or shake with his head.
Then place a heated cautery, soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye.  Next, apply the cautery, whose form is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made. And if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held thus upwardly.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand near the cautery, from the eye to the nose, for a short time, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you have reached the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Then place a compress with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine upon it, until the bone is exposed, and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Aim at the location of the fistula and split it; then place a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this, into the fissure.
And pour into it a quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good retention cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the sick person a cloth soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the fistula location, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said from the cautery, and cure, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will return to its own proper place.
On the method of cauterizing in the fissures of the lips.
Chapter XX.
Fissures, called hairs, frequently occur in the lip, especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and if treatment is ineffective, then use a small, knife-like cautery with fire, according to this shape.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cauterizing agent until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in an oral fistula.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus, and breaks open; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula is formed; then you treat it, and treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size.
Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its innermost part; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterward, with what we have said about treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is drawn out and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what appears in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens due to moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then with fire, a cautery, the form of which will come after this, so that you place the cannula on the tooth, and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire have already reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your will.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and let him hold it for one hour, and let him spit it out.
For the moving tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, either cold or a worm is in it, and treatment with medicine does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
However, the cautery with butter is to take cow's butter, and to boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan.
Then take a cotton ball, and wrap it around the tip of the tent.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place hot iron on it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to apply a bronze or iron tube. And let there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then apply the cautery, whose shape will be given, and place it upon that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another.
And it is necessary, upon the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he shall spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity you are able; and this is the form of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the Strophuls.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
When Strophuls are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and do not yield to digestion through medicines, and you want to hasten their digestion, then use a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery through the other end; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the shape of the cannula heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of the voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated primarily with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the nocrati at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last vertebra of it, and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with that which preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in illnesses of the lungs and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and illness of the lungs are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
And if your desire is cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, called Punct, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost another.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, cauterization will be alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at once.
On the method of cauterization in the titillico, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to humidity, and does not settle back into place after the dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient shall be placed on their back, or on their healthy side.
Then lift the skin, which is on the inner side of the titillico towards the upper part with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then having a cautery with two prongs. Whose shape is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of cauterization then is of six cauteries: and there are prongs according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the shape of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added over this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery bruised leeks with salt.
Then make the infirm adhere to quietude, so that the limb does not move at any time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does it happen thus, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the infirm is cured.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When there occur in the stomach cold and many moistnesses, until they draw it away from its complexion, and the phlegms multiply within it, and frequent methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the sick person lie on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoon-shaped part of the chest, the size of one finger with a nail cautery, and two cauteries below it on either side, one cautery each, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen them between each so that they do not join, when they will cause pus. And let the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery used to make this cautery be one according to the form of a circle in this way.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as if you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with ink; then cauterize it with the point cautery; then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the manner of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or to thick wind, until it emerges from its natural complexion by a superfluous discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed supine on their neck, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added; and let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If, however, he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: for the skin there is thin, therefore know this.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter XXX.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is invaded by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and you see now, that the treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then heat the cautery, which resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it a single cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the suppuration, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits, until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that one use this kind of cautery, unless someone whose study in the medical art is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come with experience many times; then indeed let him dare upon this kind of operation.
But truly, to leave it alone, is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleuresy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots should be applied to a cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is that you take from the dry long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, and which is the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and light it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery at the junction of the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downward on the part below the beard.
And with two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from behind: one on the area between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And you should not compress your hand with the cautery, rather it should be clearly visible when smelling the skin. And some ancient ones have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a rod; and they burn, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it, and pus comes out; as we have said in the case of liver abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Of the method of cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the spleen's ailment, with what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is used for it in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, by lining them along the length of the spleen in the manner of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be as we have said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the sick person be lying weak on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat a cautery having two points, as we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the sick person's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot points, until you penetrate the skin with them on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Then treat the cautery after you have let it discharge pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than any other preceding treatment.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless applied properly.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have stated in the division, and the treatment is not beneficial, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him; for two intentions should be gathered to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be pointed, according to its preceding shape; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its preceding shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When abscesses form in a hydrops patient, and they fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular [parts], and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then, make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like extremity of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and on each thigh, make two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water will sweat out from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal distension. Chapter 35.
When abdominal distension is due to cold and moisture, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated by the methods of cure, but not healed; and you see the infirm patient tolerating a cautery of exuberant strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a fine claviform cautery, and a large cautery over the alcatin, above the alhosos, or two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moistures, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower spine of the back a little triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and cauterize him on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clauile cautery; and leave the cautery open for some time; then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Then introduce it, heated, into the excised althelul; and finally, move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do it once or twice. If therefore there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Then treat them with that which you apply from the ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
When the sick person does not respond to the incision and operation we described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus flows from it, and corrupted humors.
Therefore, it is fitting that you probe it with a fine probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and the extent to which the cautery entered. And repeat the cautery over it, until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your necessary quantity.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestines, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do that, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed, and the materials are cut from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is deep within it, or something like that from those: whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or strong wind, and it lessens because of that infirmity, then it is necessary that you cauterize it above the almethen [region] above the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a clauili cautery, whose description preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidan itself.
Therefore three lines will appear.
Therefore the latter will be more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, to the point that the weakened person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin.  Cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left.  Let the length of each cauterization on the side be according to the size of a thumb's breadth.  And cauterize it with a cautery from the lower back, or with two cauteries if one is insufficient.  Let it be as the previous cautery, a closed cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter XLI.
When cold and dampness occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception by this, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back, or with two cauteries.  And let the cautery be closed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors are discharged into the anus's pouch, and cause its exit from its place: and a sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area over the anus's pouch with a similar circular cautery; after you mark with ink around the pouch, as it revolves; and so that the pouch itself falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same shape as used previously in cauterizing the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the cauterization's depth be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it is prolonged: then it is necessary to relieve the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however, the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the infirm person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery over the ankle four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the sick person indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the sick person a bad injury, or a contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in their cauterization, and the leg became swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then came a loosening of the belly, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men said regarding the cauterization of the buttock, of which this is the method of cautery.
Make a cautery iron similar to a Samian one, whose diameter is half a palm: and let there be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery, let there be a third cautery.
And let the space between each cautery be the quantity of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron, fitted well to the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then let it be placed on the box of the buttock of the sick person lying on the healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards, apply plasters with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, by this type of cautery, O children, we have used little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who will wait upon it.
However, it is from good cauteries for him who suffers, and he finds with it its place.
A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which the hinge of its door descends, of bronze or iron, the length of a wall; and whose height they should have two knots, or approximately themselves.
And let the space that is between both be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let that which contains them adhere to each other, according to this form.
Then place it upon the box of the anca, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
And press your hand heavily upon the box of the anca.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for a quantity of an hour's time; and let the sick person tolerate its burning and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the whole anca with sweet water from the hot water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter over it until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the final help.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, as you did on the anca equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, both one part, grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a small hole, according to the quantity that the radius enters: and place another glass pot under the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime with fresh water, that both are submerged by a finger: after which you press them with your hand with a good pressure: and leave the pot until the acute water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then gather all that water and pour it over more lime, and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Because it produces the action of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the anchas are cauterized, also as with tesisie, and honey of anacardi, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the ancha and sciatic vein was cured: and he magnified that it was very great.
And he said, because he did not need any other cure, and because he was healed in one instance, until he reported, because he perhaps entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragi: and if fresh is not found, take dry, fresh: and it is to be ground a great deal with a little fat, and placed on the ancha, where the pain is, or leg, or thigh: and it is to be bound, and left for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels a lessening of the burning.
Then put him into a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, put him into a couch.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not fitting for anyone to use a cautery with these remedies unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place that is between the toe and the ankle, and is closer to the ankle.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease to do this until feeling comes about by mediation to the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of superfluous matter, and similar things, from the infusion of cold, damp matter: and indeed cautery does not fall upon, except in this single kind, which is brought about by the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made upon the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself; after marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength: and let cauterization be performed with the cautery-point.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with the middle cautery-iron, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a hump.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often happens to young infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing during elevation and movement, and you find in the lowest thoracic vertebrae and their nodes that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this shape.
And let the cautery encompass the entire vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, lest you apply the cautery to the hump which arises from a nerve spasm.
Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any member of the body, then when such pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is to cauterize it after evacuation, around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
This is its shape.
And if you need to pierce on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on every side, with this same claw-shaped cautery. If, however, more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in a circular fashion around the foci, as if two lines are revolving.
If however the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every knot, and above the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person from good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, and the intestine or the zirbum descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to be near: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to abandon eating on his day.
And let him use from the lenitives, so that the excrement descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the zirbum or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pectineal arch, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then with a cautery of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or zirbum, to its concavity.
Then let the attendant place his hand on the area, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already opened between the patient's legs, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another attendant above his legs, and another above his chest holding his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, your hand with the cautery standing upright.
And hold it until with it you reach the mouth; or again with it another time, if you have not reached with it the mouth at first.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is of no avail.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide him nourishment for the duration of his treatment, that which will soothe his stomach so that his intestines do not expel during attempts at and acts of evacuation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with complete healing.
When, however, Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are incipient, and the will is that they do not add, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be from then on as one third of it.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not be added.
And already some early ones have said that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the Rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery-iron.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in certain limbs, pain from a fall or blow occurs and persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If, therefore, it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one adjacent to it.
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
And especially the species of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you intend to cauterize it, consider its nature.
If the leprosy is extensive, and you have treated it as we have described in the divisions, and it does not decrease nor disappear, and you fear that the corruption will spread throughout the entire constitution, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the noted head, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the base of the neck.
And lastly, hold your cautery for a little while, until it imprints a small mark on the area, and the layers are loosened from it: so that the expulsion of gross vapors from it may be alleviated; and also cauterize the spleen with the cautery, according to what has been said before.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the patient, and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two cauteries on the two jawbones, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the haunches near the base of the tail, and one above it, in the same region; and two on the hips; namely, one on each hip, and two on the knees; one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of the chest; and cauterize on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on each heel of his feet, and on the fleshy parts of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the last of the heels, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is applied to the bone of the breastbone, and another to the bone of the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more help and benefit there is.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size, and smallness, according to the members and joints, according to what has gone before in the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numbed limb with cauteries, according to the deserved size of the limb, or its smallness.
And let your cautery be entering into the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness, which happens to the hand and foot, in the spines of the back at the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is aged and no remedy from the arts of medicine is applied to it, then cauterize above it itself with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood; of each take one part; mix these all together, and cover a cloth with it, and apply it to the affected area until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
However, the wise men said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear it will ulcerate, and I have seen that happen several times already. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and the need to hurry the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course of purulence is relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding evil. Chapter LIII.
Corrosion is not unless it is a corruption that walks in a limb, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see corrosion in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries of fire, small and large irons, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If, therefore, you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remained of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine.
For indeed it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already said that its cauterization with corroding medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
On the method of cauterization in corns and warts. Chapter LV.
Often this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and it is a thick, filtered substance that harms the foot. And cautery in them is in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, make a concave cautery like a vulture's wing, which is made of iron, according to the size of the corn from all sides, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. For it will be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment until it heals.
If they are not cured, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery with hot water to them. And it is, that you take a cannula of bronze or iron or from a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn or whitlow.
Then introduce a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses against the root of the corn, and the hot water finds its way deep into the root of the corn.  Let the patient wait a little while on the hot water's action for an hour.
Then release it, for the corn is uprooted with its roots.
So do with them one by one, until you come upon all that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are uprooted, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremore.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor ceases with the olive-shaped cautery, and the healing of cold illness is hastened. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased; and the superfluity that makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary for this to be done after bloodletting.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often, a flow of blood occurs from an artery that has been cut in a wound, either externally, or in an incision of an abscess, or a cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is contained beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it. Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another until the blood is stopped.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the sick person. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it; especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is to be tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines of a nature to cut off blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a fitting constriction by means of a cushion.
However, he who performs its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of burning things, and the like, does not truly help it, except rarely.
If however this happens to someone, and a physician, or medicine, is not present for him, then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger upon the orifice of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and its forceful constriction, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger is not to be removed, above it continually with very cold water, until the blood has congealed, and thickened, and been cut off. And meanwhile, let him consider in it what it needs from a cautery or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Albucasis's Book of Surgery, Part II. Concerning Incisions, Perforations, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, that every illness in which it is appropriate to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and the occasions for it, the causes themselves, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker may have his question relieved. And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, my children, to learn that in this chapter is contained the terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision above an abscess, or opening of an exit, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or incision above a stone, and similar to these: from all of which tremor and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation befall you, for sometimes in this art the ways of men fall upon you along with the ways of illnesses.
For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is slight to him; because of the severity he finds in his illness and the length of his malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his instrument, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy success has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication concerning that to which health is fittingly achieved.
For in that is help for you concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not deprive you of direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter, distinguishing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the neck to the feet, so that your inquiries concerning it, and what you need, may be eased.
Concerning the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without easing it.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in anything but children, and death hastened to every one whom I saw afflicted by it; therefore, it seemed to me to omit treatment in it.
And indeed I saw one child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit on himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone on top of the sifac.
And the treatment in that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you cut a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width, and let the length of the fissure be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the spatule.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand inwards, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you cut in the middle of the head with three fissures, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Then apply a liniment of wine and oil over it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And feed the infirm person with all dry foods of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the infirm person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts occur in someone's eyes, or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the infirm person should shave his head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries become visible.
Then the infirm person should tie his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Then mark with ink each one: and cut each one with a scalpel precisely on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be done across the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it above with the incision.
And the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when a vein is cut, blood emerges with a pulsating outflow, which leaps inward with frequent jumps.
If however the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Then mark with ink, and cut until you reach the bone.
And that which it is necessary to expel from the blood, is six ounces, and perhaps you expel from it more, or less. All of that according to the amount that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains adhering to the bone from the sifac, then cut it away, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with bandages of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple's muscles, or chronic, intense, and similar afflictions: and is treated with the usual methods of medicine, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or in their cauterization, as we have recounted.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the weak man should shave the hair that is in the temples, and aim at the artery appearing in the temple.
For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by intense cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the weak man should bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or apply steam to the area with warm water, until it appears to you in a clear manifestation. Then take the spatula, which I formed a little earlier. Then scrape the skin with it, easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the coverings which are beneath it on all sides.
If however the artery is slender: then wrap it with the hook's end.
Then cut a part from it, according to the amount that its ends will be elongated, and contracted, and that a flow of blood will not occur.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk or other strong cord, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur before the wound is healed and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same operation.
And it is a better operation, unless the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot complexion.
Because cautery is from among those things that help in ending moistures.
Therefore, it is a better help.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton, and cushions properly made be placed upon it.
And after the removal, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with dressings, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, during the operation, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and tightly bind your hand, until the blood is cut off.
If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood coagulates.
And embrocate the place with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.
And that which is easier and less difficult than extracting an artery, is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to that of a date stone.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold proceeds in both of them; and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other, and easier and more easily done.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and place both of them intensely heated, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that that which is between its extremities may be stretched out.
For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the treatment of persistent acute lachrymal discharge from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from the veins on the exterior of the skull, and no medical treatment with medicines is effective, and you see the patient's face already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded; and his eyelids are heated by the intensity of the tears; then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment, and they named this treatment, with the Knife.
And it is necessary to instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, along the length of the forehead; and the length of each incision should be about two fingers; and one incision should be equidistant to the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and the space of each incision should be the width of three joined fingers; and have prepared for you a piece of sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose shape follows next.
From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision; and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the spatula, that is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then pull out this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its shape.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from clots of congealed blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place on them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basil ointment, and with the other remedies by which wounds are cured, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their gaze already impaired; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, piercing pain deep within the head, followed by sneezing; then, understand from these symptoms that those matters and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the better cure for them is this.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to shave their forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little one across, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision go as far as the bone; and draw your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; and you shall dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Then bind them from above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is now lessening, then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and bean; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a type of stone from those that do not adhere nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill some oil of violets or sesame oil into the ear.
Then administer extraction of it, and make them sneeze with incisions, and plug the nostrils at the coming of the sneeze, after you place around the ear scraps of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upward.
For it often goes out with this treatment.
If however it does not go out, then administer extraction of it with gesti, that is, with thin forceps; whose form is this.
If, therefore, it goes out with the forceps, it is good.
And if not, then administer extraction of it with a thin, single-hooked, slightly doubled instrument. If, therefore, it does not go out by that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear's opening far, and fill what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by strong suction. For many times it goes out with what we have described.
If, however, it does not go out in this way, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of glue, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of the rod after you have wrapped a suitably positioned piece of cloth around it; then introduce it into the ear canal easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If, therefore, it does not go out with all that we have described, then hasten to make an incision, before a hot abscess, or spasm, occurs.
And the method of the incision is, that a weak phlebotomist first in the cephalic vein: and draw from him from the blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of his ear near his fat in the depressed area of it: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then close the incision promptly and treat it until it is healed.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If however it does not yield to you for removal, then take a slender, thin spatula, according to this form.
And administer it with the removal of that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you have put many fragments of it; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine instrument, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thereby relieved.
However, for water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the sick person to use sneezing with condiments at first; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he lies on that ear in which the water is.
If therefore it emerges through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and warm them a little with fire, and let the sick person insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him jump on one of his feet on that side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, he should not cease to do this with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
And now the water emerges so that you take one from papyrus, or from rush, and insert one end of it into the ear, and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then again another rush, and do this many times, until all the water emerges; and remove it with a tube, in accordance with what was previously stated concerning the stone.
In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with forceps, and hooks: and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
However, in extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the weak one tolerates it: then suck with it by a strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
If, however, they do not obey you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, in which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver, or bronze, narrowed below, in which there is a small opening, wide above.
Let the impelling part, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze properly.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap a cloth around its end in a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicines you wish, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cloth from above, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the weak person feels it internally; and what is poured into the ear should be heated a little with fire; and be careful that the distilled substance is not excessively cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Chapter 7.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it also happens to some people that blockage in the ear canal occurs from a wound, or from flesh growing there.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear opening, where vision cannot reach it; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the opening, and vision can reach it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the eye cannot encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
And in that which vision can reach, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it.  Then, if you see the blockage visible, open it with a thin probe, whose shape is as follows:  Its tip should have a small width, and a pointed edge; and the rest of the probe should be smooth on both sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook, and cut it away with a forceful yet gentle hand, until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you sense a blockage with the patient's complaint of difficulty hearing, attempt to open it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a bandage on the ear, fitting the size of the opening that you prepared, and wrap it with Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a bandage, and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle crushed zegi powder on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has already become abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the bandage, and replace it with another bandage, which you will wrap in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear.  And use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding, as described in the tract on distillations.
On the treatment of the eyelid's ulcer.
Chapter VIII. These ulcers that occur on the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should grasp them with forceps or a hook, and cut them away with a scalpel from their roots.
Then apply pounded zegi to the area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something happens in the eyelids that is similar to a granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called a granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the procedure in them is, that you should consider then, if it is a granulation proceeding in that which appears on the eyelid, and it moves to every part, and its removal is easy.
Therefore make a fissure over it, in width.
Then scrape it from every part with ease, until it disappears.
Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
However, if its excision is not prepared for you unless after you have pierced the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in some way.
If the fissure is large, then collect it with a suture and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and makes it flesh.
And if the swelling is sloping inward toward the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the swelling with a hook; besides which you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is extended by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the swelling, with salt water, and treat the place with that which makes it flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the swelling of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is produced in the tissues of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children.  It burdens their eyes, and they suffer from morning catarrh, and cannot look at the sunlight, because their tears rush to them, and therefore you see them always lying on their faces, and sleeping on them.  Their eyelids, covered by the swelling, are damp under the eyebrows.  The prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare strips on it, and make a circle from that strip according to the amount that Axirnath encompasses on all sides.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions across the width, and let the incision not be larger than that made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many ways the Axirnath proceeds from the incision in the form of a white fatty fragment.
Therefore, extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed; and be careful not to press into the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and injure it.
If, however, the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should gently insert a little more into the incision until the Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we have said.
Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that the remaining moisture from it liquefies.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
Concerning the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, so that it wrinkles improperly.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow on the eyelids beyond the natural hairs, and become numerous, then they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed treated according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by canes, according to what I will say.
You should place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, with a spatula sliding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with ink, which should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it varies in humans.
For among them are those who need a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid. Then, with a spatula, find along the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be close to the natural hairs, as thick as a ray.
Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape the whole of it. Then bring together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cause that which is superfluous of the threads to adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do it; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the sutures and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with that which dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its bringing together; but it will be better.
This method of treatment the ancients taught Ataxmir.
However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good treatment, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal cutting.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal lifting; and lift the skin over which the mark is made, as we have narrated.
Then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
If however a boil occurs at your incision, or your fissure: subdue that boil with cauterization, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have described.
Then make two canes or two thin pieces of wood, whose length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of a spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then, carefully place each one upon the excess from the eyelid, and tightly bind the two canes from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days. For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls away of itself.
If, therefore, it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it heals.
When it therefore consolidates, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in it is, that you take a fine needle, and introduce into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread beneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place their head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation is revealed: because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it; or leave it until it lengthens after a period, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of operation in it is that you find that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen pad, and tie it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict, for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek, and embrocate with water in which cooked althea, linseed, and the softened dyaquilon ointment have been mixed with some oil, and wrap with it a linen pad, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is to try by all means that it does not consolidate according to the form it first had.
And this operation which we have described is indeed only a certain rectification of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs lower down is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental kind results from a wound, or fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of treatment in it is, that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and you dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a radium, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are gathered, the shape of them becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we said, of softening medicines, and with poultices, until they are healed.
And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure beneath the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a poultice, according to what we said.
And the summary of treatment for Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
For it is indeed of many varieties in form; and a prudent craftsman prepares the instrument in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the form to the natural one, or nearly so, and the afflicted person himself, according to what suits him, from the operation and instruments in various positions.
Concerning the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this adhesion occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes attached to the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the tip of the probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt; so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be such that you scrape off that adhesion easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with water; or distill upon it from a still, from dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate the eyelid and the eye with flax thread; and place on the eye wool soaked with egg white; and after three days use the still and solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of the tear flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous; and it is similar to hard, fine sifac.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture; which when it touches iron, or you attempt to grasp it with a hook, is severed, and the hook does not fix itself in it.
And both types do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses, until it covers the sight, and prevents light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the infirm person should place their head in your lap.
Then open their eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of few doublings, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse's hair, or an ox's, or a cow's: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you saw it with the hair until its last part.
Then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear-duct flesh, so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
And beware, lest the spatula touch the horny membrane, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Then after the incision, put some crushed salt, or a concoction made from ziniar, into the eye, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with whatever is necessary until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor a hook fixed to it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines and heals as I described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a thin, gentle, weakly sharpened spatula, according to this form.
And scrape the nail from above with care.
If you see that it becomes thin and breaks, and the scraping is imprinted on it, then drop from your hour glass into the eye a concoction made of ziniar, or a red sieve, or crushed salt; and cover the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation, until the entire thing is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the operation on it with the scraping, until it heals.
However, if the prominence of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great damage, it should be suspended with a hook, and a part of it should be cut out; and do not make the incision too deep, so as not to interrupt the flow of tears.
Then drop into the tear duct a red liquid, or one made from ziniari, until it heals. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh that grows in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either mixed in or piled up, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose hip.
And the operation in it also is that the infirm person should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks: and hold it with one forceps, or tweezers.
Then cut into the flesh at first, until all of it is finished with the scalpel.
And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it in the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the hoof, or with small shears, with which the asel is gathered, as will appear from its form after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines: and place upon the eye externally a bandage with the white of an egg: so that it is secured from a hot abscess.
If any alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess.
Then repeat upon it the operation, until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by a natural or accidental path, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and hinder the eye's operation of sight; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which Sebel is present is strong, and there is no illness in it besides Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with a single hook, or two, according to your judgment; and let the hook be a fine double hook, according to this shape, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this shape.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors delicately, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved; and beware of injuring the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then distil into the eye either green or red dye, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the sebum.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with what quiets the pain of the eye, and leave it for several days until its pain subsides and is safe from a hot abscess; then repeat it again according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
Concerning the reduction of the Arissati to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call Arissati a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to its preceding narrative.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you should open up the abscess near its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the opening is exposed.
When therefore the opening is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called Asperi's head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a small shield,  pointed with the file's point, or with a fine point of an aliskilfer, and place it upon the corrupted bone area. Then turn it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do that several times.
Then turn it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do that several times. Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become abscessed, and no accident occurs in it: then you shall know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to redirect the fistula into the nostril opening, according to this method.
And it is, that you uncover the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and its wood be a pyramid tapered down to the end, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and move your hand away from the eye a little.
Then revolve your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it: through this, that they find air escaping from it when they hold their hand over their nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent, drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh arises, and the place hardens, then the material that was escaping outward returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter for the sick person.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes entirely, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then you should release the patient, then bleed him, afterwards apply cupping to his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above over a plaster with many bandages.
And the manner of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the amount needed for the eye; then bind over them with a strong bandage.
And again apply cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the uvea tunic, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of the uvea, and it disfigures the appearance of the man because of it, and one wants to cut it: then the operation on it is as I describe: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle in which there is a doubled thread from the tear duct side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle; and tighten it greatly.
Then pull out the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls off.
Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the uvea is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the albuminous moisture runs, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment, called Alcomnati, is nothing but a discharge that gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of operation in it is that you make the weak person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it, until you see the discharge descend to the lower parts of his eyes.
Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is released: and the sick person sees things as he saw them before: and if it did not descend lower, know that it is water.
If however the descent of the discharge is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a thin spatula, and split with it slightly above the cornea, near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea at the limbus, until the discharge comes out.
When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you mixed honey, or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water descending in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the kinds of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining it; then take the same according to health.
Then, therefore, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tightly restrain it; then with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, press down the eyelid of his eye.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
Then place the end of the almond near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, upon the white of the eye, where the smaller tear duct appears; then press the almond with force, and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye; and you sense that the almond has now reached the empty space.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see it in that very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almond up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, apart from letting the almond emerge.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almond with ease, and you revolve your hand gradually. Then dissolve some clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Then place a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, over the eye, and bind the healthy eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
If the almond does not yield to you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from people whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Therefore, gently scrape with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand in the opening: and it is only to make a subtle way for the almond's place.
Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a suitable bedchamber be prepared for the sick person, in which they sleep on their back in a dark room; and let them be forbidden all movements, and coughing; and place their food such that it soothes their nature; and let them not move their head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its position until the third day. Then remove it in that dark room, and test his eyesight; and make him see things.
Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it should not be done at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be delayed; because water ascends quickly through intense exertion.
However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess, until it is calmed; then, restore its vision and place over its face an oral thing by which its vision is regulated for a few days, while it is in that dark room.
Then let him leave the house gradually and return to his own homes.
And know that in the zaltea a disciple is not excused from a vision sometimes; then let him dare to operate.
And now indeed one of those from Alayrach has come to us, who said that in Alayrach a perforated magdan was made, through which water is drawn.
But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that, nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made properly of air; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and the extremity sharp.
Forms of the magdan.
Concerning the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Sometimes various flesh growths arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many legs, and some cancerous, stony, and dark-colored flesh; and some that is soft, not dark-colored flesh.
Therefore, in the case of the soft, non-deceitful, non-cancerous flesh growths, you should have the patient sit between your hands, facing the ground, and open their nostrils. Insert a hook into the flesh growths; then draw them outward, and cut what you've grasped with a sharp, fine scalpel on one side, until you know the entire flesh growth has been removed.
If any part of it remains, which cannot be removed, then scrape it away with a fine instrument with ease, until no part of it remains.
If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is appropriate. Or, if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is separated and all flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be placed in the nose.
If, however, the nose opens and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that flesh has grown within the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place a finger's width, or less, between each knot.  And let the sick person, with a rod or whatever is possible for him, push one end of the thread into the nose after he has made it like a probe.  And let him pull it until it reaches the abscess and comes out above his throat.
And often children, like Attomi, do a similar thing in schools; and it is an easy task for whoever wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Then cut away the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then withdraw the thread; and after cleaning the blood, place in the nose a bandage that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the thing in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
If, however, it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze: it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell; and its passage should be similarly shaped.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula, like a reed.
And the shell-like instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; and there should be a handle at its rear end, with which you hold it when you heat oil, or whatever you wish from extracts and liquid substances, in it.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart arises at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance you should cauterize it and eradicate the whole of it.
Then place upon the site either a cautery or a burning medicine which acts in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
For I have often seen that he who incised a man's abscess, and great harm resulted from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in colour, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the pus, and incise it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the site with what dries and constricts it, until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit comes from treatment, except in some individuals.
Therefore, when something happens to one of those [parts], you must consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring together the edges of the wound with a suture; afterwards, treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to scrape away every part from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and powder over it the blood of the dragon, and crushed olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of Diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the suture is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suture of the belly; or bring together the separation with thread, as I have made you know.
Concerning the extraction of knots of the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many men indeed often suffer abscesses hard like grains of grass on the interior of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you turn the lip and cut open over each knot of it and suspend it with a hook and cut it off from every part.
Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi until the blood is cut off.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of flesh growing on the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients call a growth.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow.
Then place upon the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron instrument.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, or greenish, hard crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inner and outer, and between the gums, until corruption spreads from it to the gums, and the teeth become unsightly due to it.
Therefore, you should have the weak person sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the molar and tooth, where crusts and a substance like sand appear, until nothing of them remains, and similarly do with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
If therefore that which is on them from the initial scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until at last the desired effect is achieved.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the lower part is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, as you see them.
Of the extraction of toothache.
Chapter 30.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace its function when it is eradicated, since it is a noble substance; until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the afflicted one is compelled to eradicate it, that it be strengthened and be certified to you that the aching tooth is [now] firm.
For often the pain deceives the afflicted one, and he thinks that it is in the tooth's saha and eradicates it; afterward, the pain does not recede until the afflicted one's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletters.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatumile, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with small forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees; which you have now held firmly, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments, and introduce it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you perform the scarification around the gum on all sides very carefully.
And maintain your strength so as not to break it, and lest a part of it remain, and return upon the sick person from that malice which be greater pain to him at first.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness in eradicating it, beyond what we have described.
For many times they cause great infirmities upon men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have witnessed many times. Then it should be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then take some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved at first should be of long extremities, short handle, thick, so that they do not double when pressed upon the tooth; they should be like you see thick handles, until when you grip with them, they do not give way, nor double; of short extremities, and be of good iron, or of well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there be teeth, some of which enter others, and grip with a proper, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the eradication of a tooth, something remains, then it is necessary to apply a poultice of butter to the area for one or two days, until the area softens. Then introduce the algasti, or forceps, whose extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork.
However, this is the shape of the forceps.
Let their extremities be made like a file within, or like an aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary to cut around the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in length, somewhat thick, and not be soaked, so it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
The shape of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the end.
The shape is triangular with a slender end.
It is also assisted with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this. And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the discussion of teeth.
There is also assistance with this instrument, resembling a large hook, of this shape, a twisted triangular end, where there is some thickness so that it does not break, and let it not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth; and similarly, other instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to the operation and illnesses themselves that they signify.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots, then probe above it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and aid with a forceps, whose shape is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone is held, or it is held with it, and does not escape and depart, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with suitable medicaments for it.
If however there is small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and care for it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of prominent teeth above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those of a venal nature.
For if a tooth is born behind another tooth, and is not positioned properly, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then remove it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, whose shape is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however, it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of tempered steel, whose shape is this.
Let the whole be of tempered steel, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth does not move and fall out; then, gently, at the end, scrape it with some razors.
If it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even: and flattened, and does not hurt the tongue, nor spoil the speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite down on food lest it fall out: and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has not succeeded: then the method is to bind them with gold wire; for silver becomes green and putrefies after a few days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of a medium fineness and thickness according to the size that it will take between the teeth.
And the method of retention is to take the wire, and to pass a double length of it between two healthy teeth; then to weave the two ends of the wire between the displaced teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weave to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving until the point where you began; and tie your hand with delicacy and skill until it is completely immovable; and let your tightening of the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip out.
Then cut off the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together and turn them with forceps; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the displaced tooth, so as not to injure the tongue; then let it remain tightly bound.
If however it comes loose or is cut, tie them with another wire, and it will stay with that wire for all the time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the method of retention of two healthy teeth and two displaced teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after falling out to their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and no one can do this unless they are an artful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes a piece of bone from the gums is fitted, and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its place, from which the tooth is strengthened and tied, as we said; and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then insert a hook into it and split it in width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zegi over the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, which is appropriate for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which is beneath the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes a boil occurs beneath the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps enlarging so much that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dusky color, or black, hard, and the sick person feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place on it pounded zegi until the blood is stemmed; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate subsequent care until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is that you should consider before its operation, if its abscess has subsided, its heat having been completely calmed, or if it is diminishing with a certain reduction: then, therefore, make the infirm person sit in the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
When, therefore, you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your gaze falls upon it, then take the hook and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as far as you can, except that you pull out with it something from the coverings.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows this.
It resembles shears; however, its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other's point: hence, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or soaked in alfuled.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
One side should be sharp, the other side not sharp.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the pomegranate rinds have been boiled; or with myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped; then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut it according to what I said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing to a foul condition, few senses, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and I had already prohibited her eating and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if it had remained one day or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had exited above the two nostrils.
Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out of it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which emerged from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess; then I cut a part from it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess for a long time, and the abscess succeeded the place where I cut, until it was prolonged too much and with it.
Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stood apart; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin, then you must incise it.
And whatever is collected from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown or black color, and has no feeling, then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For in it is fear upon the infirm.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit facing the sun, and press his tongue with the instrument of which the account has preceded; then fix a hook into the grape, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after the incision, use that which we have described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, the sick person is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and terror.
And the method of the cautery in it is not, except with sharp water, and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have said.
Then take from the water that I have told you in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva runs from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall hold it on the uvula for a half-hour, until you see it blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a clot, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and pour the clot with the medicine, and insert the radius with the clot into the cannula from above, until the clot adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you achieve what you desire in terms of cauterizing the uvula.
Then leave it; for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a clot soaked in butter, and cleanse with what is around it from the medicine; and wash it with cold water.
And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore more beneficial than incision and less fearful.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than cautery and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil them.  And let the pot be properly coated with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument should be placed in this manner.
Let it be made of silver, or bronze; and let the end, on which the pomegranate is, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's onset.
For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not fitting that you do it except at the waning of its hot stage.
If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a reed and place the rind of an egg at its end, so that the patient's mouth is not burned; because the egg rind prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from a good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or fish-thorn, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract what is evident from them, upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the presence of light, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the weak vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will be expelled through vomiting.
Or the weak person will swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge; and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it departs. If therefore it does not depart with what we said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curvature, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough befall him, and propel with it the bone, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
But that the sick person introduce it is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him propel it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it departs.
Concerning the extraction of the leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When the leech is treated with what I said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument I have told you.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers.
If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow tube, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person almost up to the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the tube a heated iron with fire.
Do this repeatedly, and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls off.
If however it does not come out with what we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with fleas, or with asa with the instrument which I have narrated in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that repeatedly, because it will fall off.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle is a hole; and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then direct the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall off.
If it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it in sight.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
And its tip is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, on which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to their occurrence, namely, one, and one in this book; and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and because it comprises moisture.
And the second way is due to the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses, some must not be perforated unless after the maturation of the pus within them, and its completion; and of them some must be perforated while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration prolongs itself until the surrounding matter putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a nearer cause of contraction of that member.
Or it is an abscess on a principal limb: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that limb, or through that limb, the principal limb.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unripe; and it is not fitting to perforate a raw, not fully digested abscess, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its terminus that which is not healed. It is necessary to know the time of perforation of an abscess which has matured according to its completion: and it is by the cessation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness and throbbing, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and the other signs. And it is necessary to make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of the more vehement prominence: and let the perforation be directed in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and ultimately in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the perforation along that limb.
However, when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much pus and filth, and perhaps its lips will harden, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated in accordance with the width of the body, where necessary, or according to the limb it needs.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions in proportion to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which the skin should be hollowed out, and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and is in its final stage, that is, already dead, like that which happens in many, such as ulcers and buboes.
And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like a groin abscess.
And among them are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
However, that which does not have a head, like mild superficial abscesses, ought to be perforated with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not rush to extract all the pus at once; rather, extract only a portion of it.
Then plug the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more of the pus.
Do this repeatedly, in stages, until it is expelled; especially if the sick person is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man; for the animal spirit of the creature is often resolved with the expulsion of the pus; and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, you ought to cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply strips of linen, or old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures in the perforation, then you ought to insert a strip into every fissure, until they meet.
And if in the abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or hollowed it out in the surrounding area: then you ought to fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with linen fluff without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it is healed.
If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them; and place it repeatedly over the site of the blood flow.
If however the flow of blood persists, then you should administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in the divisions.
If however it is during winter, and the site of the abscess is one of many nerves: then you should apply cushions with warm wine and oil; and place them over the areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then you should place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make it all cold.
Until, when the third day arrives, as we said, then you must open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer the treatment that is appropriate for it, until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction, I have now spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment, section by section, individually.
Concerning the section of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the species of nodules, which the membranes containing them enclose: as if they were the sacs of hens' eggs.
And their species are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that in their incision no artery is encountered.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should probe them with an instrument, whose form follows after this, called the Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture has thus been evacuated, then scrape the cyst containing the moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For it often returns if anything is left of it. Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then repeatedly apply the dressing with Egyptian ointment a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; for then treat the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and exert your skill in removing the tissue which contains it.
If, however, an artery opposes you, then do that which I will tell you afterward.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we said. And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are in the head in some people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with whatever is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of swellings on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those that occur in the neck from them are single, and multiple: and they are generated from one another: and every swelling from them is within its own proper tunic, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the varieties of these swellings are numerous.
And from them are stony ones; and from them are those that contain humours; and from them are malignant ones, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you must excise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b, to the line, g, and scrape it from every side: and spread the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said regarding abscesses of the head, and gradually extract it.
And it is a precaution not to cut a vein or nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not cause you to injure your hand with the incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from the operation, then place pounded zegi in the wound, or some powders that cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it begins to and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is cut off then.  Therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then treat it.
If the entire Strophula is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two edges of the wound; and close it immediately, after you see that no superfluity remains at all.
If however you see that superfluity remains due to the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary that you aim to cut its root and remove it; and apply the suture which we have described.
And whatever humours the Strophulae contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see the site of its maturation; and place the puncture from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Then, after the puncture, apply lint with ointment, and similar things to it, to corrode what remains of corruption, until when you see the wound now cleansed: then treat it with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the Epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said this incision in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In those with quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; for it does not bring benefit, because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the harm that occurs from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis below three or four rings of the epiglottis, with a small incision in width, at the point between two rings, so the incision is in the soft tissue, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision, as it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should divide the skin until he reaches the canal; he should avoid the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the soft tissue as we have described: and it is signified by the incision of the canal from the phlegm that comes out of it, along with the rupture and the severance of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound, skin, and suture it alone, without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this account we have given is not to be applied except when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the throat of the sick person; and the sick person is raised above death, and his breathing is about to cease; they go to cutting the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and as much as that: then, therefore, they ordered the wound to be sutured and cared for until it is healed.
And that which I saw for myself is that a certain maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a portion of the lung's passageway with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dead.
Therefore, I discovered from the wound, and found blood which had emerged from the small wound.
Therefore, I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor a ligament; and wind was escaping from the wound.
Therefore I hastened to the wound and treated it, until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her former state of health.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
Concerning the section of the hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural or it is accidental. In the natural one, certainly there is no ingenuity.
The accidental one, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the other way is similar to the abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not appropriate to presume to cut into it with iron, unless it is small; and you must probe it, and investigate it with the [surgical] probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut; and extract it with that which contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then explore the entire thing.
Then treat the place with what is necessary from the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the cutting of tumors.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it is a source of doubt. Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor there is no heat, no fever, no pain, and it contains small cysts, which are their own sacs, and they are the same color as the body.  Their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture.
And the colors of the moisture are many, as I stated in the division. Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a tumor, you should examine it and inquire into its nature first with an instrument called an Intromissum, as its form will be described in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigating abscesses and all tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place you find in the abscess, and you should slowly rotate your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand, according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what comes out in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture of any color emerges, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is greasy. Therefore, cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I have taught you. And suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with ease. And if you can, guard the cyst over it, so that you may extract it healthy with the tumor.
If, however, the cyst breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece, until nothing remains of it.
For if any small or large part remains of it, the tumor returns for the most part.
If it defeats you, and a small part remains, then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place over it what sits as a warm abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the tumor is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with that which causes it to heal. If however there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cutting what remained of the tumor.
Concerning the external instruments for incision and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of instruments for insertion, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with squared ends, fittingly, so that they hasten the entrance into the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called *beris*, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes, from whatever is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and slender, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citron wood, or of bronze, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of citron wood.
And black lead is also made, which is suitable for examining fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness with those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Since some of them are long, some are medium, and some are short, according to the size of the fistula and its constriction. The shape of hooks, and there are many kinds. Since some of them are simple, namely those with a single curve: and there are three kinds, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And some of them are blind hooks: and there are three kinds.
And some of them are hooks having two curves, and there are three kinds: and some of them are hooks having three curves, and there are three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and excoriated: and there are three kinds: since some of them are large, medium, and small.
Their cutting edges are sharp, other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed like this, unless to help in excoriating knots for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find some relief from the burning sensation he finds in the excoriation of an abscess.
These are large, and there are three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a bellows with which alcohol is made: and on the wide end a hidden spatula point is placed: and it runs into the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The shape of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Forms of cupping vessels with which blood flow is cut off: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat elongated, as you see: and let them be of a fine delicacy.
And it is necessary that there be these kinds of cupping vessels, large and small, with you, so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and when no medicine is present for you.
However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the legs, and the thighs, and the arms, and the nipples, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to hazelnut shells, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this manner.
Concerning the treatment of male nipples resembling those of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the nipples of some men become inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be defiled in sleep) until they resemble the nipples of women, and remain foul-looking, ulcerated.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, should cut above the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g.  Then scrape off all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
However, if the nipple inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens in women, then it should be cut into two parts on its upper sides, with two similar crescent-shaped incisions, each contained within the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, what is necessary from the treatment, until it heals.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's distress, or because of the flow of blood, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then care for it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the species of hard Strophulae, some containing cysts, and some containing moistnesses.
Therefore, those of them containing moistnesses should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, following this form, from line b to line g.  When, therefore, all that is in the abscess, of pus, is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then remove the lint, and treat it with an appropriate ointment, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the species of knotted Strophulae, then cut on it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
If however the wound extends in this, so as to emit pus, then administer a cautery on it, according to what we said in what has been said before.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of the artery and vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery bursts and the skin above it consolidates, then very often an abscess occurs from this: and similarly it happens to the vein also, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body.
And cutting over this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is from them, from the swelling of the artery's opening, make a lengthwise incision in the skin.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle under it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then puncture the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood contained within it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off; afterward, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If there is an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand whatever you can from the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess itself with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the grapevine ligature, from two sides with two ends of thread. If, however, you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess near the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is within it comes out; then cut away the excess skin, and leave what is tied from it.
Then place upon it a poultice which you have steeped in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment, which is done with linens and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess which occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them through blows, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens most often in the places of the helpers, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, the sick person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not an abscess collected deep within the body, rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forwards, or before, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be lanced with iron.
For perhaps contraction will result.
However, in that which is in the head, or in the forehead, cut the skin with a lancet.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and join the wound with stitches: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Certain people often have, in their bellies and in their other bodies, tumors which are called Fungalia, because of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned inward.
And some of them are small, and some of them become very large.
And indeed I have seen a man who had two tumors in his belly, which were more like fungi than other things; there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were turned inward, and they split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Therefore, I cut them open, and found one weighing approximately ten and eight ounces, and the other approximately six ounces.  And the procedure for cutting them is, that you should observe, if the patient is moist, and the color of the tumor is white, moist, with a fine root, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries at the ready in fire.
For often a great deal of blood is expelled when it is cut; therefore, if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see the patient is fearful and timid of the incision with iron, then take a thread made from lead properly, and bind it with it to the tumor; with the method we described, and let it be for two days.
Then add to the lead dressing.
Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses upon the tumor, until it is severed, and falls away by itself without effort.
If however the tumor is large in its root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread; especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to cut a tumor that is dark-colored, with little feeling, and foul in appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a discussion of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the navel's eminence.
Chapter LII.
The navel's eminence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures in the skin above the belly; and from it comes forth wind, or an intestine, according as it happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, as was previously stated.
Or from wind constricted within it.
If however it is due to a fissure in the skin, and the exit of pus, then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is smooth, without pain; and appears in various locations.
And if it is due to the extrusion of an intestine, then its location, with that which we have described, is of a more varied nature.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps with a sound; and it greatly enlarges at the entrance of the bath, and with great exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the side.
If however it is due to formed flesh, then it is a severe, large, hard abscess, and it adheres to a certain quantity.
If however it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth. And the operation on it is that you should then consider, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or wind: then you ought to refrain from its treatment.
For there is fear and terror in it, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine or the diaphragm, then you ought to order the sick person to hold his breath and stand stretched out.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterwards, order him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel, over the place you marked with ink.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Then tie it firmly around with thread, or with a silk cord, a strong ligature; and let the knot of the ligature be tied.
Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the ligature.
If you find it already captured by the ligature, then extract the ligature, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
If, however, the artery or vein is opposed to you, then surround it extensively.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh rots; and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
If the eminence of the navel is from flesh that is there, or from moisture, then it is necessary to cauterize the abscess, as we have said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who succeeded.
And the treatment for it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and relieve the patient from black cholera sometimes.
Then, if you find it with clear fullness, a phlebotomy.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation where he is placed for the operation.
Then apply the hooks that fit it to the Cancer.
Afterwards, hollow it out completely from all sides with the skin, according to your examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with any instrument possible there.
However, if a large flow of blood from an artery or vein resists you: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already discussed in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs: and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanitis: nor to the species of hyposarcae at all; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not benefited it, then consider.
For if weakness has already followed the patient, or there is another infirmity with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the bowels, and things similar to those: then beware of treating him with iron; for there is fear of it.
If however you see the patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a helper behind him will express his belly with his hand, propelling the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a pointed spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two pointed parts, long, with pointed ends like a spatula.
However, there should be some degree of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it during the operation all the way to the intestines, and injure him.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a distance of three fingers, downwards in a direct line above the pubic bone.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the fluids do not flow to that weak place.
Then perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and do so as if you were scraping it; and let the amount scraped off be the size of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Then perforate, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty space; and it is the place of the water.
Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument of this shape.
And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; on its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other; and the tip of it is cut, according to the cutting of a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water a medium amount in an hour.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope happens to him that approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you by the virtue of his pulse and by his condition.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the opening that is above the sifac: of which I spoke, that you should pierce it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person tolerate it; and also draw out a small quantity from the water. Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains little of the water.
However, if you fear over the sick person, and you remove much from the water: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I related in what preceded.
Concerning the treatment of infants who are born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urinary passage is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in an improper place.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide assistance with its perforation immediately when it is born, using a very thin Spatumil, according to this form.
Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wishes to urinate, it is removed, and it urinates.
Then return it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine that flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in whom the opening is in an inappropriate place are harmed.
For this is why, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward, until they elevate the penis with their hand upward. Nor is there generation for him, on account of this, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight manner: and it is a very foul sickness.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick person is laid on his back.
Then extend his penis with a forceful extension of your left hand, and cut the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp blade, or a sharp spatula, as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that its middle becomes similar to the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle, as is proper.
And beware of blood flow during your operation.
For this often happens.
Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning Albucasis's descriptions of what happens to the foreskin and the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These things, described by Albucasis, often happen to the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off, until the whole of it is cleaned.
Then place upon it a poultice steeped in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with the ointment dyafinicon, until it is healed.
If it is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary to administer a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of the Albather is between the foreskin and a part of it outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather which is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the outside; for when you treat both simultaneously, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
And similar occurrences also happen in the testicles, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize all that is already blackened and that wants to corrupt, or that is already corrupted.
Then apply a line over it afterward with honey which has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and the ground and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply the cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For the cautery is helpful for two dispositions simultaneously, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
If the head of the shaft is corroded and destroyed entirely within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra, so that the sick man urinates over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the shaft, and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound, or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the shaft is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to distinguish them thoroughly, then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of the shaft, and from the foreskin.
That is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is perhaps perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the shaft with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated. On the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is an operation performed by our hand, of our own will, and its use is in boys specifically, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation and a gentler path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
This is because I have found most artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, cutting with a razor and with scissors, and the experienced using cautery and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore, perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to cut again in order to cut the other, and future pain will result.
And with cleansing performed by cautery, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with a cautery, perhaps the iron slips out and corrupts your operation.  And the skin of the boy is of short nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and ligature with thread, proved a good experiment to me; because scissors are proportional to the incision: since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression is formed in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is, that you make the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, realize that you do not do anything other than tie a thread to his penis and leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible for you, on account of what his intellect receives.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of whatever filth collects on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the area of the lower ligature with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly and remove the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and meeting; so that a nail fragment does not escape them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles taken equally.
An error occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the entire inner skin, or part of it, escapes at the incision. Therefore, you should extend it from your hour with your finger before the suppuration of the place, and cut it in equal proportions.
If you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
If however three days have passed and that which is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated, then leave it until the boil subsides, and peel it off easily, and cut it as is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders we have described in the treatise on powders, and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and escapes to the upper parts, that will not harm it either.
Therefore treat it with that which we said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or growing flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak and bent over on his knees.
Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him stretch his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man draw in his breath as much as possible.
Thus, the stone is driven by the neck of the bladder to the rear, wherefore the urine is released.
If, however, it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the sick man, then it is necessary to administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be thin, smooth, concave like a bird's feather cannula in its fineness, long in the likeness of one and a half palms, to which there shall be a thin cannula at its head.
And the way of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its extremity wool, or cotton, with a good ligature: and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if any wool projects, but introduce into the cannula with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg: and make the sick man sit upon a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Then double it upwards from the navel's part. Then drive the syringe into it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the sick person feels that it has reached the empty place: and this is not done in this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is in which is tortuousness.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urine passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the concave place, in which that which propels it is, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, humidities are drawn out: and when it is propelled, it is expelled far with it: according to how the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to project the humidities into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the humidity, and draw with that which propels it upwards, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its extremity into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Then propel the humidity with that which propels it; for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the weak person feels it. Form of a slender clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then aggregate the circle, as a vessel is aggregated: after you place in it what you wish of the humidities, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
On the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of each: and I have discussed the stone in which the operation is by hand and incision; and this is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am relating it with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most frequently in children.
And from its signs is that the urine issues forth from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs their urethra, and suffers with it, and frequently hangs down. Then it rises, and the anus discharges with it in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, up to the point when they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
However, in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those things; and the cure is easier for someone whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is conversely difficult.
Therefore, when we arrive at the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the waste that is in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination. Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or leaps from a high place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a child; or the middle finger if he is a full youth; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it stands under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place which you wish to cut; and command the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand to remove the skin which is beneath the testicles on the side of the place where the incision is.
Then insert the scalpel, the shape of which is this.
And make a cut in the space between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the cut be transverse, so that the incision be wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the amount that it is possible that the stone egress from it be not larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise something above it: either to bind upon it with a well-made instrument, whose end is like the Moon, which binds upon the stone, and does not escape from it; or to introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved end.
If however you cannot with it, then enlarge the hole a little.
If something from the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest one first towards the bladder's opening.
Then cut upon it.
Afterwards, drive the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision.
Because it happens to the infirm one of two things, either that he dies or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him:  because the place does not entirely consolidate.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or apply ingenuity in its fracture with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place upon it a cloth steeped in oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be seated.
Then lay the infirm person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with the ointment dyafinicon and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
However, if in the wound a hot abscess is added, and corrosions, and similar things: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from it; and that is known from the expulsion of blood with the urine.
Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply of every kind with what is suitable from healing, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two thighs, and the buttocks, for the sake of the medicaments which are placed on the area.
If a small stone is in the urethra, and is fixed in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I describe before you reach the stage of incision.
For many times you will be spared from incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it. And it is to take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, of triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the urethra under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and strive to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand on that which remained of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
For it indeed breaks, and it goes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
If, however, this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread beneath the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself, between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread beneath the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above it, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason you must do this when you tie the thread above, to raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
If, however, a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden because of many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary to accept a female physician, well knowing: and few are found.
If, however, you conceal it from her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a female midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who touches upon this part of the art: make her present, and especially to her, to do all that you prescribe to her from investigation of the stone. First of all, that it should be seen if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that he insert his finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore he finds it, he should confine it under his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the afflicted woman, and inquire concerning the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she move it gradually from the orifice of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it at the root of the thigh.
Then she shall cut upon it at the opposing midpoint of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whatever side it is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger shall not be removed from the stone, confining it below; and the incision shall be small at first.
Then she shall insert a rod upon that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she shall add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the species of stone are many. For from these are the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round with branches.
Know therefore its species, so that it may be signified to you through this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded zegi, and hold it one hour, until the blood is separated.
If, however, a flood of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with bandages in a suitable constriction; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone departs.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is not present unless there is a collection of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg; and it is called sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in part of the egg, until it becomes putrid; which is another egg, and there is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned; and that does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this hernia is indeed from the weakness that happens to the testicles; wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its colour inclines to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and there is also that which is more.
For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat the length of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture encompasses it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own membrane, then the abscess is round with the part of an egg, and on account of this the man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Therefore, when you seek knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the square instrument, whose shape preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the instrument, judge about that which is between it.
Therefore, when we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person that he be bled, if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back upon a slightly raised object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who should extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the abdomen.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubic bone: and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac which it contains: and scrape it and observe, or beware from this, that you cut it: and let your scraping with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the egg more: and carefully examine it with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a large hole, and extract all the water. Then separate the two edges of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upward, and do not touch the skin of the testicles which encompasses it: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its totality or in fragments, especially its thin side.
For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
If, however, the egg protrudes externally from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Then bring together the two edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then you ought to tie the vessels, which are the suspensory ligaments, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterwards, treat it as we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do it; afterwards wipe away the blood.
And insert into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are cushions; and bind them over it with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the extremities by which it is pressed be made of linen, or damp wool; and let them be joined together with a constriction in the lumbar region of the breeches; and one extremity shall take over the anus up to the back, and the second shall take to the side of the crest; and two extremities over the two thighs below, and two other extremities over the two groins, and let the entire constriction be joined in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, as we have described; until when it is revealed a white matter containing water; then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and let it be heated until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated thin cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
And be careful, from the egg, that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
If, however, it creates opposition for you at the hour of incision, or a hot abscess at the hour of cautery, or blood flow, or anything else: then it is necessary to cure that which creates opposition for you from it with the cure which suits it, as was previously stated.
If, however, the patient is fearful and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I describe it: and it is so.
When it is certified to you by that which we have said about signs, that the branch is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the wounded area, and bandage it, and allow it to run the remaining water; then treat it until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is opposition to the egress of water at the time you perforate it: and it is not unless because a white membrane causes opposition in the wound's orifice, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you introduce a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose form preceded: or add a little to the wound's operation.
And know that the water returns, and gathers again after six months, or approximately those.
When therefore it gathers again, then let it be perforated according to the same method, and the infirm person will pass their days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision on this tumor, there is fear of leading to destruction in many dispositions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its removal is salvation from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
I say therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and that happens from many causes, namely. Or from an acute, or acrid, excess that is poured onto the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and the abscess is serious.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and no sensation is in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as its previous mention has already shown, or from the inflation of veins.
Therefore, what arises from them from the inflation of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it completely.
However, that which arises from the inflation of veins does not spread from it anything upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that a section be made on this kind, and on the other flesh: and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Then raise the egg upwards, and extract it with the white sifach: and release the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the egg and cut it. And if there is adhesion between some of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free the entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Chapter LXIII.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise, and walking, for the infirm.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it, remembered.
But it is necessary, as we say, that the operation be performed in it according to what the first ones did. I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the sick person sit upon a raised seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel, making a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape it from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle, straight along the length of the body, and extract that which is collected from corrupt, putrid moisture.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force of generating pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no evil through it.
However, if it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it may waste away or dry up, and there is no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal rupture. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its dilation.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the dilation of the sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from a section of the sifach, because it causes a sudden, severe pain from the beginning; and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine through the zirbum; and this is called a 'Ramex intestinalis' and 'zirbia'; and sometimes it occurs with windiness.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and with it is the harm of the infirm person, because it causes mild pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, one must be cautious of the cases in it.
And the method of operation is, that you should command the infirm person to reduce the intestine with their own hand into the interior cavity, if it obeys the return.
Then he is to be placed supine on his back between your hands, and his legs are to be raised.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Then fasten hooks into the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape off the siphak, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is revealed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and separate with it the adhesion which is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then, with your right hand, move the skin of the testicles inwards; and with your left hand, extend the white siphak upward; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards; and you separate the adhesion that is behind, completing the separation.
And examine with your fingers, that there is nothing there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If however you find anything of it: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle with thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it near the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some, with a figure that is in the form of a cross; and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until no vessels which nourish them can send anything to them; so that no hot abscess may occur from it.
And place again a ligature second, outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures, leave from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, the incision from which blood and pus runs, as we have narrated in what was previously said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described.
And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
For it often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
If, however, its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water; and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds, until it is healed.
Of the windy rupture.
Chapter LXVI.
In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
And indeed the first ones said that it occurs as we have described in the rupture which is with the vine.
That is, tie the vessels after the incision over them with ease from below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, as we have said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if anything does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time continues with it, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
And that occurs from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we have said.
That is because the scrotum is stretched; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurated, and protrudes.
And the treatment for it is with a cautery, as its previous description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Then cut the place of the suppurated and protruding rupture, with a cut across the width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then draw the scrotum and whatever is under the skin, until when the white scrotum is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it upon the protruding place of the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding places on the extremity of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them to the other with sutures; then pull out the extremity of the rod.
And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, just as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal colic. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the scrotum contracts, and no prominence of rupture is added.
And the cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Many times the skin of the testicles softens in some men, on account of which the flesh between them softens, and its appearance is spoiled.
Therefore it is necessary for whoever is asked to treat it, that he cause the sick man to lie upon his back, and that he cut all the skin that has softened over the natural skin. Then he shall join the two lips with sutures; and if he wishes, first sew up the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care, until they heal and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is excommunicated under our law; and because of that, it would be permissible for me to not mention it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two methods.
One of which is that it should be within the physician's knowledge when questioned about it; and so that he knows the treatment for it should it happen.
And the other method is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
I say, therefore, that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the way of the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and no longer appear under the touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
One of them is that there appears in it, at the interval which follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in the space between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which are hairs; and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
However, in women, there is one kind, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis, just as very small male testicles, protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until the pressure of it escapes.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine flows, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the Tentigo, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo perhaps arises upon a natural condition, until its appearance is disfigured and ugly; and sometimes in some women, it magnifies to such an extent that it expands like in men and even reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excess Tentigo with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not proceed too deeply in the incision, especially into the deep root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it heals.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that grows within the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outward, resembling a tail; and because of this, some earlier writers call the ailment "tailed disease.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it, as we cut Tentigo, and treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, a woman's vulva that is not perforated, or has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from illness that preceded it: and indeed it arises either from added growing flesh, or from a thin sifach, or a thick one; and it occurs either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper, or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge is achieved through the obstetrician's examination, if there is an apparent nearby blockage.
If, however, it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the blockage is from a thin sifach, and is close to the two lips: then hurry, and break it.
And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sifach is broken, and the blockage is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman do this every day, so that the place does not solidify again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If, however, the blockage is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be medicines with you that stop the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not quickly solidify, hold it for a few days: and administer a linen plaster, then treat the rest with the usual treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes other flesh-births arise within the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut in this way, for as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, do not use any opposition with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood runs from them constantly.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already discussed their species and signs in the division.  Here I will state which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb, over which the senses fall, are those that are treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to put the woman into a cold room.
Then, with forceps or a rough cloth, extend the thelil and cut them from their roots.
Then, sprinkle over them, when the blood flows from the incisions, some of the powders without mordication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let her feet be pressed against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, lay her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If the blood is thus cut off, it is good; and if not, apply cupping vessels to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnogloss, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the affected area.
When the abscess therefore subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit of the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and tumors, and boils, and herpes, and carbuncles, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I have already discussed all these illnesses and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the divisions: it is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore it is necessary to consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever; and you see it reddened; if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation; and treat it with that which helps with maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that lowers two seats, and lean back, or be supported on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her belly; and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those that are behind.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with the Radio the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument be not more than the depth of the womb, and injure the weak one.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the entire instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented; and it is necessary that it place the whirling, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and that the minister hold the instrument, and that he revolve the whirling until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary that you separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a lint soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the lint, and withdraw the section into the depth of the womb.
And place externally on the womb, and on the pecten, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather, treat it with what we said in the division.
Instructions for Midwives, on how to treat living embryos that have emerged in a non-natural form.
Chapter LXX.
It is necessary for the midwife to first know the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, the signs of it are that when you see a woman pressing downward, and she desires to smell the air, and she is relieved of what is above her in childbirth, and the embryo's exit is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it: or hanging, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
But whatever is beyond this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot; or its head and hands emerge; or its belly emerges; and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar forms that are blameworthy.
Therefore, the midwife must be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and beware of error and deception; and I am showing every form from among them, and how the nature is in it, and what is signified by it, and stand upon it.
When the fetus emerges on its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and vaporize her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her fingernail until that which is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If, however, it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Then, after the enema, instruct her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with a condiment, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you must gently and gradually return them.
If, however, it does not yield at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and elevate her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and remove the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is on its feet.
When the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they emerge as far as the hips, then order him to compress it, and make it sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then reduce the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form.
For then it will emerge with easy exit.
If it is obstructed with everything that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and pound the whole in a mortar with good pounding; then smear the woman's vagina and the lower part of her belly with it.
Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches the hypochondria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make a poultice of myrrh, and apply it.
When, therefore, the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and bind her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her belly with a gentle pressure.
For the pus will immediately come out.
The exit of the fetus upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Then the woman will lie on her back, and her feet will hang down: and she will lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Then gently press upon her abdomen.
Then pull out what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Then gently press what is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends upwards.
Then let her insert her hands, and gently straighten the fetus; and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
His hand be applied in the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If truly she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment that you prepared from the mucilages.
If however she receives it from childbirth, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward her mother's back.
The midwife must hold the fetus's hand, then gently turn it around, and adjust it with ease.
When it is adjusted, then place upon her vulva what we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then command her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to her right side.
Then command her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with condiments.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cleave the afterbirth with your fingernail, until it is evacuated of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and command the woman to compress herself several times, for it will exit with ease.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not live at all: and although they multiply, they are contained by a single afterbirth; and they are separated by a membrane, distinct from each other, fastened to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit; and they emerge by that praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated. If some of them are difficult at birth, and arrive at the unnatural figures we mentioned, then treat them as we have described: and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and deliberation, and devise a method according to any figure, in conjunction with what is prepared for her by the ingenuity leading to salvation.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more, up to ten, are formed in the womb; and it has been verified by me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife. For perhaps something similar to that will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
If, therefore, the woman is of sound constitution, and is not suffering from any of the accidents from which her death is feared: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her by two parts, or be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the os uteri with moist oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the uterus with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable locations for that.
Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the locations near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand; and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we said, until it reaches the empty thing.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let not the extension be only according to straightness, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit may be alleviated; just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
If a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may turn with them what is retained.
If, therefore, a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks are to be shifted to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If, therefore, the hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and so it is necessary that you do for the other hand, and for the two feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary that the midwife insert thorny spatulas between her fingers, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similarly, she should do this if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary that she sever the head; or extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it is not complicated, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into fragments, according to what is possible for you.
If the lower belly has an abscess or contains dropsy, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture runs from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is gentle.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and to split the belly or chest until what is within them flows out.
If the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If, therefore, the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek the head with it, and pull it with her fingers until the mouth of the womb; then she should insert a single hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it out with it.
If, however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred there, then it is not necessary to work on it, rather it is necessary to administer the effusion of moist, fatty things, and apply plasters, and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it equal.  Then administer what we have said in the case of a living fetus.
If this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and removed.
And it is necessary that you leave nothing of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she conceived again above it, afterwards another fetus died also.
Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to discharge pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed upon it some strong-attracting plasters: and the bone emerged from the place.
Then several days passed, and another bone emerged.
Therefore, I was amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Then I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition: and she thus lived for a long time, and emitted a little pus from the place.
And I did not establish this as extraneous, unless because of the knowledge and assistance contained in it, which the skillful physician provides with a hand in the treatment.
On the shapes of necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a book-binder's press, to which two similar screws are attached at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this screw must be finer than the press; and to make it, either ebony or boxwood is suitable.
And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger; and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the socket, so that it opens with them when you turn the two screws.
The form of the screw with which the socket opens.
Another form similar to it, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its tip there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition from them is like a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, her feet hanging down, opening that which is between her thighs.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife achieves what she wants.
The form of another dizziness, which the ancients called the form of the impelling force by which the fetus is propelled.
The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook having a single spine.
The form of a hook having two spines.
The form of tongs with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
The form of a spatula with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, even wider ones.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker is his operation and the higher his reputation among men, on account of their quantity.
Therefore, do not disregard any instrument, so that it may be prepared for you.
For their necessity is undeniable.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundina.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundina is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with incantations, and grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid. Put in it herbs which open the mother's womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, seham, cassia wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the mother's womb. And let her hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If however, after this treatment, it remains and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
If however it is attached deep within the uterus, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the uterus does not collapse with violent traction; rather, it should be moved easily to the right and left; then, add the amount of traction.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the os uteri is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medication from a pot with herbs.
If however it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out repeatedly trying to extract it.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from the uterus through the os uteri, be tied to the woman's hip.
Then administer an enema to her with the tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will indeed cause it to putrefy after a few days, and it will dissolve and come out.
However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman in retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass, similar to a flask, or of earthenware; and let its wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed on the hot embers; let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and again another.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which the subtle sifac has already clogged.
Therefore, the midwife ought to pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula; and she should beware lest the hand touches it.
Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however you fear that it will be clogged, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and it should be removed when the child wishes to evacuate.
And blockage of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or from an abscess.
Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are swellings and enlargements that occur near the anus externally, or in a space of one part, and are either a single fistula or multiple.
When that swelling becomes chronic, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And some of those fistulas, when they are penetrating, extend to the bladder and to the urethra.
And some of them penetrate to the hip joint and to the tailbone.
However, one recognizes a fistula penetrating to the anus, even from one that does not penetrate, by inserting your index finger into the anus; and inserting a thin probe into the fistula, made of air or iron: when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then insert a thin probe of lead, or a hair from a horse's mane, into it until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor anything comes out of the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor worms as I said: then know that it is not penetrating; therefore hasten to treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus: then its sign is the passing of urine through it, and its prohibition from this, so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
If however it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting within to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that medicine does not work there, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is toil and vanity for him, by foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. However, in that which is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and what I have already proved; and it is to lay the sick person on his back between your hands, and lift his legs above his hips, and his hips be inclined towards his belly.
Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If however the sick person feels it near the anus, then it is necessary to insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel the probe already penetrated through itself, detected, besides what you feel between your finger, and between the fistula, or flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating; therefore do not work on it, because there is no healing for it, as we said.
They said, however, that in some people the flesh is healed, and that from the medication which is hoped to help it, it is that you cauterize a small cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert it hot into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice, or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered, flesh-like tissues, similar to the quill of a bird's feather, are now burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if the prolapse emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the prolapse, or if such is the case: and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting along the prolapse that is in the fistula until the incision reaches where the end of the prolapse reaches, and the prolapse is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
If, however, blood overcomes you and interferes between you and your operation so that you sever those tissues, then it is better, and more swiftly helpful, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings about good habits, burning those added tissues, and cutting off the blood, and drying the moisture.
Then treat it with linen strips soaked in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place emits pus, and those burned tissues emerge in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and such medicines possess astringency and drying properties.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. If, however, the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from bodily superfluity: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it there is a membrane of siphac or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of trust and hope.
For it is treated in one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to cut it away until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and a cure from nearby.
And do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not sever the muscle containing the anus, and bring about an involuntary expulsion of faeces upon the sick person. Then treat it with what we said. Perhaps it will be healed; or you will stretch out the membrane and cleanse it after cutting it away to near the anus, as we said, either with a tenaculum or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are in the incision, until where you can with inspection.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be less burdensome upon the sick person.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this manner: and this is when you introduce a tenaculum into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus, near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus; then take a tenaculum with a perforated extremity, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, for preparing hides, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and about it.
Then insert the tenaculum with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tighten each, and leave it for one, or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshy parts between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the ability to do that on account of the arm, lest you harm it.
Then do with it as we said, until it is healed.
Shape the sharp spatula with which the fistula is split, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not harm what is unnecessary, as you see.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either within the anus, like sacs of coal or plums, or like bunches of grapes themselves.
And from them are small ones and large ones, and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And some are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are mostly few in moisture, from which yellow water, or a little blood runs with constant flow, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to instruct the sick person to sit: and to express it, until it emerges from the anus, and the athers appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your nail.
Then cut them at their roots.
However, if the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of doubled woolen cloth, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle some hot powders upon them, so that they will act as a cautery in their place.
Or cauterize them according to what was said previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to the expulsion, then inject the sick person with an enema containing a small amount of irritant, so that it washes out what is in the anus, and it will quickly yield to expulsion when the patient strains.
If, however, the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy and simple: you may grasp them with your fingernail or a forceps, and cut them off.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever recoils from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you apply a suture to them according to this method.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the pile upward, and make it pierce with the needle at its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be latitudinal; and tighten the pile with a strong constriction.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them; and do not compress it, lest blood run from it.
Then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose or cedar oil, and place it over the anus; and command the sick person to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying up of excrement and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become chronic and medicine is of no avail, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their healing is removed.
Then treat them until they heal properly.
If however they do not heal, then scrape them again with a more forceful blade than the first, until they bleed profusely and become raw; then treat them until they are healed.
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, one is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is, that you stretch the athelil, and cut it; or bind it with a silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument that I will describe. A formica is also a small, filtered, thick elevation on the surface of the body, going deep into it: and when it encounters cold, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it, and occurs throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
And its treatment is, that you take a cannula from a goose's quill, or a strong vulture's quill; and place that cannula over the Formica, until the circle of the cannula encompasses its parts.
Then rotate your hand with the cannula, until you sever that which is around the Formica; and you place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of bronze or iron, according to this form.
Let the upper part of the cannula be at a height drawing the enclosed dumb, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself might be relieved.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the forms of instruments that are administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for loosening the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes an enema is made from silver, or from bronze, or from cast or hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too their enemas.
Large enema.
Small enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bag is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and let it have a division so that the bag can be tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very slender, drawn to thinness; and on one side of it let there be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And let the width of the opening be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be of animal bladder, or of parchment, which should be in the form of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
When therefore the bag is placed in it, it should be tied at the head of the clyster between the two separating constrictions with a strong tightening.
Then clysterize with it.
And this is the shape of the bags here depicted, and the holes. However, the quality of clysterizing with it is: to fill the bag, or bladder, with medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place under them a 'inthaan', that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant grasp the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully, until all that is in the clyster is emptied into the intestine. Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall. If the medicine compels him towards death, then let him hold on as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more useful in its assistance.
If, however, you administer clysters for diseases of loose bowels, and his death is imminent, then administer the clyster again, until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or ulcerating abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, mild, from the clysters with which children are clysterized.
And this be the form of the thin clyster above which is tight skin.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for the book, and I will here say the treatment of them with the hand and with medicines according to the complement.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things, therefore, by which wounds are frequently made are like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword or knife; or a blow with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, like a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar ones from those limbs.
And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds, so that I may set forth that reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, since the recounting of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone, then consider if it is from a thrown stone, or similar things, and has merely broken the skin; and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome from a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and draw from his blood according to the measure of his strength; if nothing is preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood issuing from the wound is small in quantity.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, anything prevents lessening, then lessen from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, place on it a poultice steeped in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are certain that it is free from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already altered it, then place certain ointments upon it, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together by means of pads, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe concerning the sutures of abdominal wounds.
If, however, the wound is already exposed to the bone, and hangs, and its retention is not possible except in a small support: then cut it.
Then treat the wound with remedies, and restore hard flesh in place of the skin, and prescribe for the sick person that they be nourished with foods containing bulk, such as heads of grain and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied area and discard it; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a spatula, or tie it.
If necessity compels it when that which we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Method of the flesh-forming powder.
Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: grind the whole thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Then bind it over with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains so that it does not fester.
For medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Of wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and a wound of the head when it is simple.
If, however, the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment be avoided with anything that causes intense astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that which is used for treatment be from medicines mild, such as lime washed with fresh water, infused sometimes with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water: and the rest of the mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with poultices.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or there occurs a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
If indeed an artery has been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity provokes it to that.
If however the windpipe's cartilages have been cut, or entirely, and the surrounding tissues are safe: then bring together the skin's edges with a suture over the windpipe's cartilage, and do not touch the windpipe, rather make it even and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable constriction, and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that possess astringency and desiccation, until it is healed.
If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound rots, and its exit is separated and alleviated.
If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
If however bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula is formed, then treat it with what is mentioned in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If therefore wind issues from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood: then do not place powder in it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick person; but put attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place an old cloth in the opening of the wound, so that it sucks what emerges from it, from the moisture; and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that what gathers in it runs out.
If, however, three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm or bad tremor of the heart or constriction in breathing occurs to the sick person, and you see the rest of their condition good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat it with bandages and other remedies until it is healed.
If, however, its healing is excused, and it constantly opens up, then know that it has already become a fistula.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the preceding sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
If, however, they are not separated, then leave them until the wound is suppurated, for the extraction of them will be easier.
However, for other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the judgment in their treatment is the judgment we have stated.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Chapter LXXXVII.
A rupture occurring in the abdomen is great, middle, and small.
From a great one therefore sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, their introduction, and their stitching is more forceful and difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore, it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, since it is inflated, opened, and enlarged; therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Because of this therefore, a better rupture of the middle disruptions occurs, since with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four methods.
Two common sutures agree in the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the remaining wounds of the body; and two other sutures are properly shared with the other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suturing of the belly; and I narrate each one to you with exposition and declaration. I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine emerges from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
When therefore this is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth, in just lukewarm water.
Or boil it in water with squinant, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it; and it is better than just water in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or marsh mallow has been boiled.
For by it the entrance of it is alleviated with small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than the incision: and there is no forcing to cut after necessity and instrument failure.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the slender extremity not be with the slenderness of a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter: and it is that which resembles a caul, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form to its own proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intent and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present between your hands, who shall hold the entire rupture with his hand, and bring together its lips.
Then, uncover from it to him who follows in the stitching something after something: and this is the common manner of one stitching.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's width.
Then, release from the extremity of the rupture a quantity equal to the ring finger, that is, of the physician's: and fasten one needle beyond that, into which you introduce thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the thread being beneath the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread: and four stitches are made.
Then tighten with the doubled thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a fitting closure.
Then release the thickness of a finger also, and fasten another needle in them: afterwards, repeat it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with whatever needles you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between thick and thin: because very thin needles pierce the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to penetrate the skin; therefore, they should be of medium thickness and thinness.
And it is not fitting that the needle be fixed in the two close ends of the skin too much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and also that it is not drawn too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the patient during his sleep, and place cushions of cloth on every side to hold the ends of the needles, and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one, or two, or about that many needles suffice in suturing them.
However, the second common suture is to join together the four ends: two ends of the skin and two ends of the si[...?] in one turn, with a needle in which a thread is wrapped equal in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, return the needle from the side from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound, so that the suture is like the suture of a cloth in which cloths are tied, and put between each suture a quantity less than the thickness of a little finger.
However, this suture is known to men.
And with this suture I treated a wound that had occurred to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound rupture was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and there was a rupture in the middle of the abdomen.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, continuing in his pursuits.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicine, could be found.
Therefore I placed an old linen cloth over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will however describe two proper kinds of suture, according to the account of the text.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end thus in the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer at the other end.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same end thus from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end thus, which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you make it penetrate in the thus end, which is on its side, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is from thus on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Then return it into that skin, and sew the end thus, which is on the other side, with this end: and draw it from the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it alternately, until you have sewn the entire exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that it should suture the skin as leatherworkers sew skins: so that you sew it alternately from one side, from one end of the skin; and that you leave it alternately from the other side, until you complete it.
The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
His speech recounts that one should sew it according to the likeness in which certain physicians sew them, so that they gather every part to its suitable counterpart by nature: and they apply the thus end to its other end, and the other end to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle into the nearby end, on the outside, and cause it to penetrate to the inside in that sole; and leave the two ends out.
Then, turn the needle, and cause it to penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of sifac, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both, also causing both to penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than common, easy suturing, and is a suturing whose remembrance preceded.
This is therefore also Galen's speech.
And some said.
The suturing of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, introduce one thread in each of them; and begin with the introduction of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suturing of those who stitch hides equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than that of the other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and you suture it, and you adapt it, then place it over the incarnating powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments which are present to you, until they cause pus; and the threads fall out, and the wound consolidates, and mirach.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if you do not have the medicines present, then place immediately upon it, from the moment it begins to emit pus, old cotton: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
However, if you fear that the wound communicates with the principal limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of tempered warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema to him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and become a penetrating exit right to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from those of the small intestine, of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that happens in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with thread above the place that has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it, so that the traction of it may be alleviated for you, and its extraction, in the event of a zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people.  Therefore, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound, and it became a fistula, and waste and wind came out of it.
Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, that a harmful accident might befall him in his belly; and no harmful accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and was exercised in his daily routines.
And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it should be bound in this manner.
And it is so that you take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those having an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it has seized upon it, and contracted its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which is cleaned from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And it is to take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is to be greatly scraped.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then introduce that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture. And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but subtlety, nor is its healing complete.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that any wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and does not close: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever it may be on a limb, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white swelling: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and for that reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And in some cases it is moist, emitting pus.
And perhaps the moisture is opened in some cases.
And sometimes this moisture is plentiful, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and sometimes thin.
And I have already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal, and flesh does not grow on it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter given to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because the corruption that falls in the region is a kind of plague, or due to a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For among them are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joined joints, such as the hand and foot, and among them are those that go towards the vicinity of the main member and similar ones.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is of this kind, is from illnesses difficult to heal, and does not receive cure, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
If, however, there is a fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and investigate it with it.
If, however, there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Because lead, with the gentleness of its body, is lightened and curves around the tortuosity.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate from its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it, goes towards other openings and flows from them.
Then, inquire meticulously in what way it is possible for you: to know whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and the cavity of the fistula is distant or close; or whether the fistula is one with many openings, and stand over the entire thing with all your strength; with your inquiry, with which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain when you press with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents of the abscess.
When therefore you have stood over all that position truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is as though you consider then, whether the fistula is a proximate apparent one, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as was previously mentioned in my narration, and remove that which is within it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, which is born within its opening from flesh, or pustules, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
If however the fistula is of distant depth, and is straight: then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as is possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines: and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron; do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If however it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is ascertained by you, then search for it, and cut it out according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb, as we said.
If therefore bone is revealed to you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its entire corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
If it does not heal, and emits pus as it did: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again, and thoroughly make a scraping and cleansing of it with all your strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a remote depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, and do not leave any of them with your strength.
If, however, something from the humors resists you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those humors and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then put over the wound something to rot it: and leave it, until what is around those bones rots from flesh and humors.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And constrict the section you cut in your operation.
Indeed, put over it, if you fear, a poultice steeped in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a poultice steeped in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointment.
For when those humors, namely, rot and are separated from the bones, the removal and extraction of them is made easier.
However, if there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you might set it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years of age, in whom pain arose in his leg, from a cause originating within the body, that is, from the internal parts, until the matter reached the leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him and with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters poured out with it.
And his treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it, which all emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skillful practitioner of the art among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters that flowed from those openings with great force; indeed, the entire body of the man was already decaying, and his complexion was yellowish.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found them connecting to each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore, I worked diligently and cut over one of those openings, until I exposed a portion of the bone; and I found it corrupted; which was already corroded, and blackened, and had rotted and was perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I removed what I had exposed, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except for that corruption, which I cut away and removed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except for the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his little tolerance, and my fear for him of death, since he was experiencing fainting spells in every hour from the excess of evacuations.
Therefore, he was healed with complete healing; and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned; and he returned to his previous condition; and no harm was caused to him by walking at all.
However, if a protruding bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: you should take a ligament and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another thicker wool ligament over the first ligament. Then tie it over the flesh that is under the bone; and stretch its end so that you pull the flesh downwards; and you expose the flesh over the area you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood or a board beneath the bone properly below, because when you do that, the saw is not prevented from cutting any corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted area for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone, and it does not appear to the senses in its appearance and necessitates sawing in another way. If the bone is corrupted and not protruding, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from all sides.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards, saw it from the first part where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short time, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except abrasion.
If the corruption is in the fingernail of the hand, or in the fingernail of the foot, then the matter is very difficult.
But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with whatever remedy rectifies it for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or a nerve.
And know that there are many knives and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rareness.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each type of operation.
And know that these operations will show you the type of instrument you need, when you have long study with them.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find within yourself that which suits it from instruments for every illness.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This saw shape depicted, let it be done properly. Let its upper arch be sharp from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be a pyramid, properly made.
Shape of the razor's joints.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, tenuous razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape also of the large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places by reason of the cutting of bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated in the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp edges.
It is made of Indian [material].
And similarly, all that we have said must be made from razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, if you have treated the putrefaction with medicinal remedies and the treatment does not help, and you see the putrefaction spreading in the limb and nothing counters it, then you must cut off that limb, up to where the putrefaction reaches, so that the afflicted person is freed from death or from the greater harm caused by the loss of the limb.
And a sign of this is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or that putrefaction follows the darkening, until that putrefaction is cut away, reaching the part immediately adjoining it, and spreading throughout the whole body.
Therefore, proceed with its excision, and similarly if the cause of the putrefaction is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, viper, and adder, and the like.
If the putrefaction or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the putrefaction so that it spreads to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the putrefaction until it reaches the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint. If, however, the putrefaction passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
And administering beyond that from treatment, is a matter of strength.
And similarly do with the foot, when putrefaction invades the toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
If, however, it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
If, however, the putrefaction has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of cutting or sawing the limb is to tie the ligament below the part you wish to cut, and to tie another ligament above the place.
And let the attendant pull one ligament downwards, and let the attendant pull the other ligament upwards.
And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad scalpel, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is to be cut or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen from all sides, and that the saw does not touch the healthy part; and that additional injury, and a hot abscess, may befall the sick person.
If, however, internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the spot quickly; or place on it certain powders that stop the blood.
Then return to your treatment, until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same happening that I tell you.
That is, because it happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning resembling the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened himself, after he saw the corruption occurring in the limb with its intensity, which he found from the pain and its burning: and it afflicted him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. He therefore came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I placed upon his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that superfluity from me: and I also feared for his death at the cutting of his hand.
Because the man's strength was above the fall.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me from him, that he hurried, and cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
And I did not bring forth this account, unless that it be an aid concerning that which falls from the kind of this sickness: and that it be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is perforated, and that which is in it, of pus, exits, and a hollow place remains, as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it, like a cloth which has already become thin: and it does not reach the ultimate in its corruption, nor does it press on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged, until the corruption reaches one of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is that you should cut that skin all around, as it is revolved: and especially when it has become thin, and is like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that final adhesion: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and consider it to be a Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it is of foul odor: then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and mixed in a vessel: and boil it over the fire, until the medicine turns red: and it reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take from it as much as you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and irrigate the Sinus with it: and tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then draw it out with pressure: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is irrigated with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you: and you should take the ash of vine wood, or ash from the holm oak wood, and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and irrigate with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed clean.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then irrigate it with water and honey, to which a little crushed ziniar has been added.
Or irrigate it with honey and wine mixed together, because the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash away, and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
When you do this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed, then irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
And take from the diafinicon plaster, dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or irrigate it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, so that the clyster tube cannot enter: then widen it slightly with iron, or place a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, on it until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring the lips of it together with sutures, and leave an amount in which the clyster can enter without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower part of it, so that the pus flows downwards; because when pus is confined in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the sinus approximately below the place you wish, then try to prepare the member in such a way that pus flows from it readily, according to your preparation.
Try to keep no pus at all in it, and take strengthening medicines suitable for the purpose you wish.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the entire sinus.
Then cut with scissors a hole in the direction of the sinus opening, a little larger than the sinus opening.
Then spread mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the first, a distance from the sinus opening, to allow the pus to escape from it.  And do not remove the large cloth, unless after some days, one at a time.
However, the one over the sinus opening, that is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may exit; and so that you may know whether that which flows from it, the matter, is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or not, and whether there is an abscess there, or not.
Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter that exits through the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion.  Then, therefore, unbind it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you unbind the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. However, if after a long time, a thin matter exits from the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are some people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act the opposite of this.
If, however, undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add to the drying medicines; but let the physicians see to it that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their virtue, such as diaphanitic ointment, when superfluity of addition of zegi is added to it.
And the most ultimate remedy for its cure is to take diaphanitic ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it equal old wine in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it does a similar action to this, when diaphanitic ointment is not present to you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and pulverize it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus; and line with the honey that you boiled until it thickened: and pulverize spices over it, and put over it the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and is lily, and the flour of herb, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sift them: and pulverize them over the honey which I mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of Fistulas, according to what has been mentioned before. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a worn nail, and the incision of a swollen finger, and the section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
When, therefore, its condition prolongs itself and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it is corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor from it: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut with an iron the entire excess that remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the superfluous nail additions now press the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary to place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If however corruption is already pressing on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it: for it will never be healed as long as corrupted bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the remembrance of its previous description.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, a nail suffers attrition or a blow, and severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from above to below.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient thereby, and it will be the cause of the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pain.
The extra finger, which is born in some human hands, is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some have bone in them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the knots of the finger.
Therefore, the one born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one born near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in the one that is born on the finger at the last knot, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
However, the consolidation that occurs in the fingers next to each other often happens either from the birth of the person, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place strips of cloth, or bandages soaked in rose oil, between them, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the area is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-two.
Ulcers are swollen, thick veins filled with melancholic humors that occur in many parts of the body; and their effect is most often seen in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, work, and carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with a strong purge.
Then phlebotomize the patient's basilica vein.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood extracted.
And the other method is that the vein should be raised and the entire vein extracted.
However, the incision of it is according to this method.
First, soak the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail further down until an amount of blood sufficient and tolerated by the patient's strength emerges.
Then tie it; and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
However, its elevation is according to this method.
Shave the patient's leg if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse it in a bath; or embrocate it on his leg with warm water until it turns red and the veins bulge; or exercise it with vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a direct vein incision along its length: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from every side until it appears to the senses; and at its appearance, you see it sloping from red to black.
When it therefore emerges from the skin, you see it white like a string.
Then introduce a probe underneath it until, when it is raised and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, by three fingers' breadth.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then raise it with the probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Then raise it, and cut it at the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do that until you pull it out from the incision that is higher, or from all the higher incisions, until the whole thing comes out; then cut it.
If, however, it does not yield to you for pulling and raising, then introduce a needle with a strong doubled thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or introduce a probe under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And beware, lest it be cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to raise it greatly, and it enters into a harmful injury from it.
When therefore you have pulled it out completely, then place on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose-oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting in which it is wrapped around in parts, and is not, as we said, according to straightness, then it is necessary to cut along its entire twisting and its wrapping locations.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you have raised it completely: and beware at your cutting on it that you do not cut a vein, or wound it; for it will be difficult for you to raise or extract it.
Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Form of the injury by which the vine is healed.
Form of the blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is its end sharp so as not to wound a vein; and it is of thick, gentle flexibility, because if it were subtle, it would cut a vein with its subtlety; indeed, it has unnecessary thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Andalus, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as happen within the bodies of serpents and worms ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this Vein is that a violent inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the Vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachma keil to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever, therefore, something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
If it extends too far, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
For if you cut it, it will contract, and enter into the flesh, and cause an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be gently handled and pulled out gradually, until the last part of it emerges and nothing of it remains in the body.  And from this vein, in some people, there emerges what is five palms and ten in its length.
And it has already come to me, that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
If, however, it is incised during your treatment time, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all the material within is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was previously stated.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
This disease is called in a certain land among us "Cattle Disease," because it often occurs in cattle, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and its passage is noticeable to the senses from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
As worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and threadworms, happen in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it travels through the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and that happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to tie that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the place with fire until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. If however you see it having already reached the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary for the infirm person to use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humours.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the ailment Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have indeed seen it, as I relate to you.
I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained an hour, I saw one swelling move with a wriggling motion, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible, so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it revolved throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
I was therefore amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in this way, in this manner.
However, I have seen many who find pain changing from limb to limb, and I have not seen it with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is otherwise than because the woman was one of those whose bodies are dry, whose veins are detected; hence, that windiness appears to the senses, changed.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and whose bodies are moist, whose veins are hidden.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then, if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then grasp above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
If however you do not see it with your own eyes, then cure it with shaking the body, and with what expels windiness, and soothes it with foul pills, and pills of seraphim, and similar things.
Of the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Their diversity is, indeed, because some of them have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
And some of them have three angles.
And some of them have tongues.
And some of them have stars.
Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways.
For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar to them.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I shall relate to you later, then you ought to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and exits the membrane covering the brain, are: because there arise from it a violent headache, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And white moisture like gruel emerges from the wound site.
And from it exits something like the watery part of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood flows from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Therefore know that death descends undoubtedly.
And the sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck, become suppurated, and the color of the sick person changes.
And he exhales a large, deep breath; and he seeks the attraction of cold air.
If the arrow strikes the covering that is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs; and a large breath occurs with severe pain, with sighing; and all the arm muscles move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly and is fixed in it, something of the excrement, or zirb, or the already ruptured intestine, comes out of the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope of its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness, then know that it is fatal.
However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, arm, backbones, collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved according to many conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery, or nerve and is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may understand through that about your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already concealed, and I obtained only a small extremity of it, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one that has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore, I worked with it until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man, which had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I worked on it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no evil accident befell him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had closed.
After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had closed, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed, and it remained, finding him little pain; and many similar things to these.
And I extracted an arrow from the king's chief man, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined somewhat to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to treat him after the arrow's fall up to three days.
Therefore I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and did not feel it; and indeed he was finding a prick and pain under his right ear.
Therefore I hoped that that prick was from the end of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster in which there was attractive and digestive virtue, trusting in myself that the place would become an abscess and that the arrowhead would appear to me so that I could cut it out; and it did not happen in the place that an accident signified that the arrow had struck the place.
Therefore I persisted with the plaster over it for many days; and no accident happened, and the wound healed in the meantime; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a slender arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared to us visibly; and I spent approximately four months with him during this time.
Then, after the wound had enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield to removal; then I did not cease to refine and devise ways about it, until I began one day, with forceps properly made, in the form that their shape will take in the conclusion of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm person was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the nature of the extraction of certain arrows: that you may set it as a rule and a meaning upon that which I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed with the narrative, nor does the book encompass it, and the skillful craftsman compares the little with the much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and discovers a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of extraneous things of this art when they happen.
I say therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two methods. Or by pulling them out from the place from which they entered.
Or by the contrary of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled out, and emerges.
If it does not yield to emergence at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for several days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its extraction is eased, and its emergence.
And similarly, if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for emergence, then leave it also for several days: and repeatedly remove it with traction and motion every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for emergence after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's attachments are enlarged.
Then pull it, and remove it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents that I mentioned appear from the weak person: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equal after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except only in the body of the bone, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the weak person remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then proceed in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
However, if it is firmly fixed, and does not yield to you for pulling: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then seek it with probes.
If however you feel it, then pull it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
If however you cannot get at it, because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge over it, until the wound is widened and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If however there are ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by every means that you can, and by means, if it is not possible to free the flesh in the breaking of the ears and their twisting, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape: and with the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction and pulling become difficult for you.
If you cannot get at it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until that which is around it rots.
Then try again: for it will then be easier.  But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said concerning treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And apply every means possible to the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease and tranquility, or with slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull the arrow, that it be weak in the form in which the arrow was in the injury.
Because it is more helpful.
If, however, it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
However, if an arrow exits from the opposite side, either something already protrudes from it outwardly, or the tip of the arrow creates a bump on the skin near the surface, and you see it protruding; therefore, cut over it, and the incision should be according to the size that forceps can grasp.
Then pull it out; for it becomes easy to remove.
If, however, it remains in the bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed into the bone and enlarges its own space; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again, until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
If however the shaft has broken, and you wish to administer an impulsion, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is hollow, then push it out with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is eased out by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh where the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close enough to what you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And from them are made many forms, large, and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the breadth of the wound, and its constriction.
The form of the pusher is concave.
And the form of the blunt pusher.
This is a blunt extremity like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and pushed with it.
The extremity of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entry into it and its impulsion may be eased.
Of the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter XCVII. The veins to be opened, of which custom runs in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Looking ones; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the extremity of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side; and the common people call it the head vein.
And Fusca.
And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; and the common people call it the body vein.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side; and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the belly vein.
And the arm cord, and it is situated above the fold; and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Salvatella; and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger; and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
And the second is the Saphena; and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse; and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and sahafati, and old, bad head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe.
And it is that the patient's head is shaved, and his nape is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, with good friction.
Then the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with ink there.
Then take the phlebotomist's knife, and it is that which is called the Incidens.
Then introduce it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomist reaches the opening.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or roughly that: and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of those things, and the cauterization of them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is of benefit for old-time hemicrania; and for crooked swelling, and constant ophthalmia; and for the discharge of excessive acute effusions to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the sick man hold his neck tightly, until two veins appear distinctly to the senses; and let their pulse be demonstrated beneath your finger.
Then mark the spots with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
And cut it, as you did in the other two veins; and cause blood to flow according to your need. Then release the sick person's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Afterwards, place a bandage and pads on it, and tighten it firmly over the constriction; and release it until it heals.
And already the remembering of them, and their incision, and their extraction were previously in the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the frontal vein after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for ancient diseases of the face; and for hemicrania, and redness; and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is as I tell you.
The infirm man tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called a Fossorium.
Its form is this.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike it with a comb, or with something else in its manner; and let the blood run according to the quantity you wish.
Then loosen the wound of the infirm person, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotom.
However, it should not be a phlebotom with a sharp end, like the other phlebotoms, but rather with a broad end.
And phlebotomize it across; because the bone is nearby; and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness; and for a boil in the eye, and ailments of the face.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is that it constricts the weak neck with a bandage.
Then phlebotomize them; and you stand over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transverse to the length slightly, with a small phlebotome, a little wide, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of slender extremity, perhaps it breaks.
Then make the blood flow out as much as is necessary for you.
And place a compress upon them, and bind them for one night, and loosen them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and ailments of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak man binds his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and cause the blood to run according to your need.
Then tie it with one bandage.
For it is restored quickly.
On the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
Indeed, the benefit of Guidegi's phlebotomy is for the constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that gnaw, that is, blistering herpes.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is that the weak man should be tied under both his neck with a bandage, and the craftsman should stand over the head of the sick person, and the sick person should sit on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should incise the vein to a length of ample phlebotomy for a short while.
Then draw out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see to be necessary for it.
Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the sick person is not overly choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the opening of veins by Algeberich.
The veins, according to Algeberich, are helpful in phlebotomy, because they contribute to the cure of sores in the mouth, and gum decay; and bad ulcers; and lip fissures, and bad ulcers, even those found on the nose and its surroundings.
And the method of phlebotomy of them is that you make the sick person sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage.
Then, roll back their lip, and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left; and the appearance of both is by the blackness of both.
And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each with a suitable incision. However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then direct yourself to the incision of the larger and more obvious of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are on the upper lip; and custom runs very much with it; and cut the two veins which are on the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sit between your hands before the sun; and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue at one side of it a vein, and at the other side of it a vein; and the colour of each of them slopes towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each of them; and beware lest you extend your hand too far when phlebotomizing them.
For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those whose phlebotomy has become customary among all people.
And their phlebotomy is performed according to two methods.
Either by piercing with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive-shaped one, as narrow as a slope, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, that which is suitable for cutting.
And from them are broad and narrow types, according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of smaller width and finer extremities.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help in phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses located under the throat and neck, from what follows the chest, and the belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on it, to be cautious and be aware of the fear from it, for an artery is beneath it.
Therefore, if he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Therefore, it is necessary not to puncture it with the phlebotomist's lancet: rather, let it be incised with a lancet.
If the Basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another vein, and to switch to another, or to seek a branch of it; or to perform phlebotomy on the brachial vein instead.
For it is indeed apparent, and cut it with the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
If, however, you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, then it is necessary before constriction of the arm, to touch the place, until you recognize the location of the pulse.
Then mark the spot with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
And be careful that the incision does not fall upon the artery's space.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then quickly place your finger over it, a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore blood is severed (for it is often severed), then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and let it be over his fear.
And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If however the blood is not severed, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present at your moment, then cut into the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities contract, and the blood is severed.
Or take a piece of fig bark, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the site of the vein's constriction with a decent ligature, with bandages and dressings until the next day.
Then if the blood is severed, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with that whose previous mention was of the place of powders for severing the flow of blood: and the severing of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
The Fusca vein's phlebotomy is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that she be cautious of her phlebotomy, for a nerve is under it.
Therefore, if during the phlebotomist's puncture, a nerve is encountered, there occurs numbness in the patient and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not heal completely.
And this nerve often appears to the senses.
However, if in some people it is hidden, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, so as to avoid it with phlebotomy, with sectioning it with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for ailments of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein, properly, if you wish, that you should puncture it with a phlebotom of olive, or with a phlebotom of myrtle, since it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery or nerve below it. However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid injuring the head of the muscle with the phlebotom and to seek a gentler place; and it does not harm it if it is not found on the first stroke, so that it should be repeatedly punctured with the phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it becomes suppurative in some people when not punctured on the first stroke, but that suppuration does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of Phlebotomy, and its consequences arising from it, on which you ought to reflect.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution against the approach of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital.
And that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the first, or third day, after three hours have passed of the day.
However, phlebotomy given in illnesses does not have a determined time; but when expediency and necessity call for it, in the night, or day, and in any hour, and in any time.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool in them, so that the veins during the phlebotomy do not draw putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members from the intestines.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, that is, satiety-induced nausea; nor one suffering from indigestion, nor one recovering from drunkenness, be bled until that is removed from them.
Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and anything that dissolves the strength from the body or the animal.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines, if it is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, about the third day, as we said: and try that his chest be emptied that day from all the bad animal accidents, such as anguish, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive discharge, and those similar to them.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs through aromatics, and scents, and dancing, and things like them, in as great a quantity as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterward, let him pull out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Then he should tie the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal or excessive in the constriction, it then hinders the flow of blood; or in its loosening, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil.
Then he should place his left index finger gently over the vein itself, under the spot where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so the vein does not flee and the incision is not missed.
Because some veins are like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy; and some are full of airiness; and when you place the lancet on them, they contract under the lancet, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should lay down the lancet.
And if not, then repeat it another time under that spot a little, or above it with haste, if the place does not become inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient grows weak, then leave him for a day or two days; and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps it will draw the hot inflammation.
Nor let him enter the bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not be released, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening according to the correct direction, and add a small amount in the procedure.
And do it quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place occurs in many people with a small operation.
If, therefore, you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you. And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies are made on veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and they do it with alfarach and sagzenea tyriacs, when one of them is placed on the place.
For blood is refined and resolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess occurs at the site of phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little, upon the place; and bind it for one hour, for it will be resolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often abscesses and prominences occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon your compression upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Therefore, beware that you place upon it something of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster on it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place is hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from his blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better than what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom it is accustomed to come upon phlebotomy syncope, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy with moderate bread soaked in pomegranate juice water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from him from the blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold temperament, then he should take before phlebotomy bread soaked in rose syrup, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in fragrant aromatized syrup.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a delicate fragrant syrup; and he should use aromatics with almug, and his chest should be lined with it; and he should use the rest which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and discharge their blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he discharge the blood gradually in proportion to his strength over consecutive days.
Whoever, however, wants to evacuate their arm and discharge their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first phlebotomy.
Whoever wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that it be evacuated for them on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever to occur, it is necessary that blood depart from it at once and a large quantity be drawn out; and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on their pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
For often that happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not appropriate when you want to release the arm and discharge blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed and the exit of blood is difficult, to press upon it forcefully and quickly extend or flex it.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it, until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with sharpness of the phlebotomist that which has clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water.
And place upon it something from the tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and apply it with gentle pressure, until the blood exits.
If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it, and do not touch it, until the abscess subsides.
If, however, necessity compels the release of blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
However, the arm's vein is phlebotomized in the place of the Fusca and Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the infirm person should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens easily, and the vein appears clearly.
Then, a slight constriction is applied over it with a ligature.
Then phlebotomize across it gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be over the joint of the hand for a short time.
And indeed, the flow of blood is greatly facilitated in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulse vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should grasp the mahason of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible.
Then phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you cut it completely, that will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to injure your hand with the phlebotom.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bare of flesh.
Then again place the hand in warm water, and let the blood run into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening, and its flow is prevented.
When therefore you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not solidify quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
However, the benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and ailments of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should place their foot in warm water: and make friction upon it, until the veins overflow: and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the vein's location is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and from it branch many branches on the sole of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
If one phlebotomizes it on the sole of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the sole of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
If, however, the flow of blood is hindered, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for that place is safe, and you have no fear of harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
The sciatic vein's location, as we have said, is at the heel on the wild side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for it is, for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of phlebotomy for it is that the patient should enter a warm bath and hurry; and he should bind his leg from the side of the hip up to above the heel by four fingers, with a long thin bandage: for it is not apparent except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist should lance it according to whatever method is possible for you, or by cross-cutting; and it is better to either cut it with an incision or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If you do not find it, and it is not at all apparent to the senses, then the phlebotomist should lance some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and toward the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood flow in the quantity you wish.
Then loosen the bandage, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
On Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done in two ways.
One with scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
For it is either with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And the cuppings that are administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places on the body.
Of which one is, the Alnocrati cupping, and it is at the back of the head; and the Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and the Alhagdahim cuppings, and they are two sheets of the neck at two sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of the Alachosos at the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with venesection.
Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness resulting from fullness, until the whole body has been evacuated.
If necessity prompts cupping due to illness or custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and whenever it may be.
This is because some people, when blood multiplies in them to the point where it needs extraction by cupping, experience heaviness and throbbing in their head.
And some of them experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And some of them experience itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the site of their cupping. And some of them have increased laughter.
And some of them experience a taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
And some of them have increased sleep.
And some of them see in their dreams blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we then order the application of cupping, after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is because it contributes to heaviness in the head and that which flows to the eyes.
