Oh, sons, since I have completed this book for you, which is the culmination of the medical science, and having perfected it with explanations and clarifications, it seems to me that I have compiled this treatise for you, which is a part of the practice with my hands, that is, surgery.
For practice with the hands is discredited in our region and time, and the knowledge of it is almost entirely lost; and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the ancients, which have been altered and corrupted so that their meanings are hidden and their power and art are diminished.
And it seems to me that I should revive the practice of this treatise by way of explanation and clarification and abridgment; and so that it may come with the forms of cautery instruments and other tools of the craft along with additional explanation, which is necessary for its preparation.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is vast and requires its practitioner to be well-versed in the science of anatomy, which Galen considered essential for knowing the functions and forms of members and their connections and separations; and having knowledge of bones, nerves, and tendons, as well as their number and structure; and of the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the locations from which they emerge.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that in name alone is one thing, but in practice another, especially in the art of manual work.
But we have already said this at the beginning of this book, for whoever does not know what we have said about anatomy is not excused from falling into error that can cause death in some cases, as I have seen many times; for some are trained in this science and then abandon it, setting aside both knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who attempted to treat an abscess in a woman's neck and cut some of the arteries, causing a great deal of blood to flow so that the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who attempted to extract a stone from a man's bladder, which had grown large due to his condition, but the procedure went wrong and part of the bladder was removed along with the stone, causing the man to die three days later.
And I knew that the patient would die from the size of the stone and his condition. This is why I refused to treat him and advised him to seek help elsewhere.
And I saw another doctor who was paid by a duke in our land to perform surgery, but he caused harm to a black castrated man who had a fracture in his thigh. The doctor treated the fracture with his ignorance, applying splints and bandages with great force and not allowing the wound to breathe. [\*\*
And he bandaged her as he saw fit and unbandaged her according to his desires, leaving her alone for several days and ordering that the bandages not be changed. In this way, the thigh and foot became infected with abscesses, leading to their ruin.
And I was called upon to treat her and prepared to unwrap the bandages, achieving peace and relieving her of her pain.
However, the corruption had already become established in the limb, and I was unable to stop it from spreading throughout the member until the patient was at risk of dying.
And I saw another doctor who lanced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated for several days until the infection had spread throughout the patient's body.
The reason for this is that the cancerous growth is full of black bile, and it is not necessary to use a sharp instrument on it, but rather to treat the member that has been affected by the growth so that it can be relieved of its discomfort.
Therefore, sons, it is necessary for you to divide the practice of manual work into two categories: one that is associated with health and safety, and another that involves risk in more complex situations.
And I have already stated in all places of this book that it is necessary to avoid operations that involve error and fear. Therefore, it is essential for you to heed my advice and refrain from performing such procedures, so as not to harm your reputation or your patients.
And so take up your arms with diligence and under the protection of God, and approach your patients with ease and confidence.
And use the best methods to bring about salvation and praise for your patients, avoiding difficult cases that are unlikely to be cured, and setting aside any tools or techniques that cause you fear. In this way, your faith and reputation will not suffer, and you will gain greater glory, both in this world and in the next, as a testament to your sanctity.
Galen also said in some of his teachings: "Do not treat a serious illness if you are not qualified to do so, lest you be known as a bad doctor."
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, starting with the first section. The first chapter deals with the head and neck, including descriptions of instruments, cautery tools, and other necessary items for surgery in this area.
Here begins the division of the second section. [** The second chapter covers dryness and lancing, cupping glasses, wounds, and the removal of arrows and similar items, all organized by the forms of instruments used for these procedures.
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, as well as treatment for twisting or similar injuries. This chapter is organized by the head and neck, and includes descriptions of the instruments used in these procedures.
It is necessary for me to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization, as well as the circumstances in which it is forbidden. [**
Therefore I say that the discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of cauterization is long and detailed, requiring great knowledge and subtlety. Many wise people have spoken on this topic, with differing opinions, and I can only touch upon a small part of their teachings, as I do not wish to be overly verbose.
Therefore I say that cauterization is generally beneficial in all cases, whether with or without matter, except for two circumstances in which it is not advised. These are cases where there is no matter present.
In the case of dry and empty matter, opinions are divided as to whether cauterization is beneficial. Some say that it is helpful in this situation, while others argue against it. They believe that cauterization is not appropriate for illnesses caused by dryness and heat, because fire has these same qualities. It is therefore inappropriate to use a dry and hot treatment to cure an empty and dry disease. [**
And deny anyone who says the contrary of what is done for all moist and dry illnesses that appear in men's bodies through cautery, because when you compare men's bodies to the nature of fire, you find men's bodies to be cold.
And I say in response to his words, that I have tested this myself several times.
However, it is not appropriate for someone who is inexperienced and untrained in the chapter of cautery from recent practice, and who has not yet understood the diversity of men's constitutions and the various natures of illnesses, as well as their causes and accompanying symptoms, and the timing of these conditions.
However, in other constitutions, there is no fear for you, especially in cold and damp illnesses, as all doctors agree on this, and they do not forget the benefit of cautery in such cases.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire and its goodness lies in cautery combined with medicine that burns, because fire is simple, and its action only reaches the member that is cauterized, and does not harm the adjacent member, but rather causes minimal damage.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches not only the member that is cauterized but also extends to adjacent members, and it quickly brings to the diseased member a difficult-to-heal condition and facilitates its healing.
However, fire, due to its nobility and the goodness of its substance, does not do anything but make excess. And it is known to us through experiment and long practice in studying the truth of causes; and for this reason I am excused from the length of my speech. If it were not that it is not permitted in this book to reveal secret knowledge hidden by fire and the quality of its operation on bodies, and its expulsion, which expels illnesses through philosophical demonstration, which would be useful for you to know, I would explain further.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the timing of when it is appropriate to perform cautery and postpone the best time for it in spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm caused by the accidental timing is outweighed by the benefit of what is attracted by cautery, especially if the cautery is necessary for pains or painful conditions, which cannot be delayed, as there is a fear of the malice, which is greater than the minor harm caused by the timing.
And this should not be surprising to you, sons, because only the common people and foolish doctors think otherwise, that is, that not all illnesses that can be healed by cautery are reduced at all times, and they wait for the consequences.
And the reason is not as they think, because cautery is only a substitute for medicine that alters the constitution and dries up the moisture, which are the cause of pain.
However, cautery is sometimes performed excessively due to the eagerness for its value and virtue of its operation, as well as its great power.
And it is possible that the patient's illness may return at some point in time, depending on their constitution, the location of their illness, its strength, and what has accumulated in their body from excesses and imbalances caused by food and other factors. However, if the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle condition affecting a member with few excesses and moisture, as is the case with dental cautery for pain or similar conditions, it is possible that the pain will not return, but rather only small amounts of discomfort may occur.
And the common saying is that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and this is a true statement, but not in the way that I understand it, because I believe that cure through cautery does not benefit from medicine or any other cause except cautery itself.
And the reason is to the contrary; and the meaning that cautery is the last remedy of medicine does not mean that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and finally at the end of the cause we administer cautery, and it benefits from that. And so from here it is clear that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the meaning which I understand as being held by the common people and foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this without reason, but rather due to the equality of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And the ancients said that the location of cautery does not cause burns, but this is not absolutely true, because I have proven and found that it only causes burns in certain bodies, and cautery with that is good and better than iron as they said; however, when you perform cautery with fire using gold, it is not apparent to you, because it melts according to the amount you want due to the softness of gold, and prepares it to receive heat; and if you apply it on fire, the gold will melt due to the heat, and in the heat some layers may come off causing damage to the patient.
And for that reason, cautery is performed with iron more delicately and more carefully in order to ensure proper operation.
I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to the chapters, and have arranged those of the head down to the feet, so that I may alleviate what they are asking of me.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied to moisture and coldness in the most superficial part of the body, which are the two causes of scurvy and an abundance of rheumatic fluxes, called coryza, from the head down to the parts of the eyes and ears that flow, and an abundance of sleep, and toothache and jaw pain, and in general all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis, scurvy, and apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, order the patient to be purged with a laxative medicine that cleanses the head, for three or four nights, according to the severity of the illness, their age, and their habits.
And then order them to shave their head with a razor, and do so while seated between your hands on an inclined bench, with their hands resting on their chest.
And then place the edge of your palm over the wound at the bridge of the nose, between their eyes. However, when the place you have designated has been reached, mark that spot with ink, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery tool, which is shaped as follows:
And then place that over the marked spot with ink, in such a way that it descends gradually, while your hand is slowly tightened, and you rotate it.
And then gently lift your hand and check the area, and if you see that any amount of bone has been exposed, such as the size of a grain of barley, then raise your hand again, and if not, return your hand to the tool, with another one if it has cooled down, until you have seen what I have told you.
And then take some salt and dissolve it over the area, leaving it there for three days.
And then place a piece of bread soaked in honey over it and leave it there until the scab from the fire has been destroyed. And then treat the area with tetranychum ointment until it has healed.
And I have already said that when the wound is open, the arm gets better more quickly, because it is better and more refreshing.
And they said that a chancre should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be kept there until some part of the surface of the bone has become attached.
And then scrape off what has become attached to the bone and have it treated.
And they said that with the cautery, it should reach the back, penetrating deep into the bone until it causes significant pain, and this is the method of treating an abscess: And they consider that from this location, vapors from the head are released.
And the wound should be left open for a long time and then treated until it is solidified.
But I do not consider both methods of cautery to be suitable for all cases, but rather only in certain situations due to fear; and it is better to leave it alone if possible, since the head is made vulnerable by the separation of its continuity, as we have seen in other parts of the body, especially when the patient's skull is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion, and this method should be used with care and caution.
Chapter two.
On cauterization of the head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs in the entire head, and is present in a patient for an extended period of time, and various treatments such as cupping glasses, leeches, and poultices have been used without success, especially if the patient has already undergone cauterization with one type of cautery that did not bring any relief, then consider whether the patient's skull is thick and hard in nature. If this is the case, and there is no significant swelling present, then cauterize again using a different type of cautery, but only slightly. And then cauterize the area on the crown of their head with a tool until the chancre has been opened up. Incise the chancre and expose the bone to the amount that we have specified, and then cauterize it with a tool in the back part of the head at the location known as the "vas," which is where the cupping glass is applied. And in doing this, do not expose the bone, because the patient will experience significant pain that is different from the pain caused by all other types of cauterization on the head.
And I say that this type of cautery is appropriate in its place, as the tool used to cauterize the corners and back of the head is more subtle than the one used to cauterize the middle part of the head. This is the method for doing so:
Chapter three.
On cautery for recent migraines.
When there is pain in one part of the head, either throbbing pain or spreading pain that reaches up to the eye, then purge the head with laxative medications and administer other treatments as I have mentioned in my previous discourses on illnesses. If these methods do not work, then cauterization should be used in two ways: by using a sharp and burning medicine or by using iron tools.
However, a sharp and burning medicine is made by taking an herb that has healing properties, extracting its juice, and then heating the ends of it on both sides. And then make an incision in the area of pain at the temple with a sharp lancet until it reaches the chancre and is hidden from view.
And then apply pressure to the area with a stopper for gradual constriction and leave it there for three hours; and then remove the herb, leaving the wound open for two or three days. Then place a piece of bread soaked in honey over it until the area heals.
And then treat the area with ointment until it has healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medications that I have written about in the two treatises on burning medications.
However, cauterization using iron tools is performed as follows: first ignite the cautery tool, which looks like this:
and is called "claws" because its shape resembles a nail with a slight curve in the middle.
And then place it over the area of pain and hold your hand steady so that only the skin is burned and not the artery that lies beneath it, and rotate the iron tool slowly and gradually with speed.
And if the amount of tissue that has become attached due to the depth of the chancre is significant, then raise your hand slightly so that the artery beneath it remains unharmed and there is no flow of blood.
And then soak a piece of bread in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it there for three days; and then apply a piece of bread that has been soaked in honey, and then treat the wound with ointment until it has healed.
And if you wish, use the tip of the knife for cautery in this way, and be careful not to accidentally cut an artery during the cauterization process, especially when treating recent cases of migraines.
Chapter four.
On cautery for chronic migraines.
When treating chronic migraines using the methods that I have previously mentioned, and when these treatments do not bring relief and are insufficient for the patient's condition, then it is necessary to use a knife-shaped cautery tool until it turns white, as this indicates that you have marked the site of pain with a line of length equal to the width of your finger. Then lift your hand away briefly, apply pressure firmly, and make an incision through the artery and down to the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the movement of the jaw, which is affected by chewing, and that the ligament not be too tight and the nerves that move it, and that it does not become spasmodic.
And if it is about the care and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut, because in cutting it there is fear, and even more so for one who is unaware of what they are doing and is not experienced or proven; and he leaves the operation to another person at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the management of bleeding from an artery according to its type, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness does not allow the use of this cautery and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize in the middle part of the head as we have mentioned, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on stretching of an artery with two knives, and this is better cauterization and more effective.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cauterization of ear pains.
When there is pain in the ear caused by cold and it is treated with laxative causes and with other treatment methods that I have mentioned in the division, but the pain persists, then cauterize it with fire using the type of cautery known as puncta, which looks like this:
Then bring the puncta close to the incision and move it around the entire ear as if rolling it, or in the circumference of each section if the pain is located in a specific area. This will help cauterize any inflamed tissue and reduce pain and swelling. It's important to be gentle and not to apply too much pressure, as this can cause further damage to the delicate tissues of the ear. After cauterization, it's recommended to apply a warm compress or herbal remedy to promote healing and reduce discomfort. Move the cautery along the ridge of the ear slowly, little by little, as you mark the spot with a probe. This will help ensure that the cauterization is precise and targeted to the affected area, while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. The use of a probe or other marking tool can also help guide the movement of the cautery and ensure even application of heat. It's important to be gentle and not to rush the process, as this can increase the risk of complications or injury. After cauterization, it's recommended to apply a wound dressing or herbal remedy to promote healing and reduce discomfort.
And if you use the cautery of ten points on the entire ear, and it is necessary to repeat the process, then treat the affected areas until they are healed. This method involves making ten small incisions or punctures around the outer edge of the ear canal using a heated instrument like a needle or lancet. The procedure may need to be repeated several times to ensure complete healing and resolution of symptoms. After cauterization, it's important to keep the affected area clean and dry, and to avoid getting water in the ear during bathing or swimming. Your healthcare provider may also recommend using topical antibiotics or other medications to promote healing and prevent infection.
Chapter 6.
Chapter 6: On the cauterization of tumors.
A tumor that has already been cured and does not require cauterization, but rather the use of certain types of remedies that come out in pus, as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases. This suggests that the author is differentiating between tumors that have already healed on their own or with other treatments, and those that require more invasive interventions like cauterization. The text may also include a discussion of various remedies or medications that can be used to treat pus-filled growths, such as herbal extracts or poultices. It's important to note that the use of these types of treatments should only be done under the guidance and supervision of a qualified healthcare provider.
Avoid cauterization with this type of remedy that comes out in dryness or through spasm of the nerves. This suggests that the author is cautioning against the use of certain types of treatments, such as those that may cause drying or constriction of blood vessels and nerves, which could potentially worsen the condition or lead to further complications. The text may also include alternative treatment options or recommendations for managing symptoms associated with dryness or nerve spasms. As always, it's important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider before attempting any medical interventions or treatments.
When you treat that type of tumor with garlic and caperberry and guarguarismes, and you find that your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first one at the ridge of the ear, and the second a little below the temple, and the third should be at the junction of the two lips. This suggests that the author is recommending a series of cauterizations in specific locations on the body to treat tumors that are resistant to other forms of treatment. The use of garlic and caperberry may have been intended as natural remedies or poultices to reduce inflammation or promote healing, while the cautery treatments themselves were likely used to destroy abnormal tissue or stop bleeding. It's important to note that the use of such invasive procedures should only be done under the guidance and supervision of a qualified healthcare provider, and with careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.
And place the cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, because softening will only occur in the healthy tissue that appears to be healing. This suggests that the author is cautioning against placing the cautery directly on the tumor or affected area, as this may cause further damage or delay healing. Instead, the cautery should be applied to the surrounding healthy tissue, with the goal of stimulating blood flow and promoting healing in the nearby affected areas. The use of the word "mollificacio" suggests that the author is referring to a process of softening or loosening of the tissues, which may help to reduce inflammation and promote healing. As always, it's important to follow the guidance and recommendations of a qualified healthcare provider when using medical interventions like cauterization.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize that area with the cautery on the right side of the outer edge of the ear, slightly above the corner of the forehead, and at the temple, the length of which should be equal to the length of your finger. And then place your hand with the cautery over the affected area until it has burned away the amount of tissue equivalent to the size of a hazelnut. This suggests that the author is providing specific instructions for performing cauterization on the ear, including the placement and size of the cautery tool. The cautery should be applied to the outer edge of the ear, slightly above the corner of the forehead, and at the temple, with the length of the cautery equal to the length of the practitioner's finger. The cautery should then be held over the affected area until it has burned away an amount of tissue equivalent to the size of a hazelnut, which may help to reduce inflammation or promote healing in the surrounding areas. As always, it's important to follow the guidance and recommendations of a qualified healthcare provider when using medical interventions like cauterization, and to carefully consider potential risks and benefits.
And this is the form of the cautery, which is a type specific to cutlers, with the shape in front of the table. This suggests that the author is referring to a particular type of cautery tool, one that is specifically designed for use by cutlers or metalworkers. The reference to the "forma" or shape of the cautery may indicate that there were different types of cautery tools available during medieval times, each with its own unique design and purpose. It's also possible that the author is referring to a specific type of metalworking tool, such as a knife or blade, which could be used for cauterization in medical settings. As always, it's important to use only approved medical devices and tools under the guidance and supervision of a qualified healthcare provider. However, it is better if it is slightly more subtle as you see; and it is necessary that the knife in it has a little less excess thickness. This suggests that the author is recommending that the cautery tool be thin and precise, rather than thick and clumsy. The word "subtil" may refer to the sharpness or fineness of the blade, indicating that it should be able to make precise incisions without causing unnecessary damage to surrounding tissues. The phrase "superflua groceza" may suggest that some cautery tools were too large or unwieldy for medical use, and could potentially cause harm if not used carefully. It's important to note that the use of sharp objects like knives or blades should only be done by trained professionals, and with appropriate safeguards in place to prevent injury or infection.
And then treat the area with what is before the procedure until it has healed. This suggests that the author is recommending some form of pre-treatment or preparation before performing cauterization, such as cleaning the affected area or applying a topical medication. The phrase "denant procezit" may refer to a set of preliminary procedures or steps that should be taken before beginning the actual cauterization process. It's important to follow the guidance and recommendations of a qualified healthcare provider when using medical interventions like cauterization, and to carefully consider potential risks and benefits. Proper preparation and aftercare can help to reduce complications and promote healing in the affected area.
Chapter 7.
Chapter 7: On the Cauterization of Ancient Apoplexy
When apoplexy is ancient and you treat it with what we have said and find that your medicine does not work and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: firstly on both corners of their head; secondly in the middle part of their head as we have mentioned; and thirdly in the jugular vein. And the method of cauterization is done as previously mentioned. This suggests that the author has already provided instructions on how to perform cauterization, and is now referring back to those previous instructions for this specific application in treating ancient apoplexy. It's important to follow these instructions carefully, and to seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider if there are any questions or concerns about the procedure. Proper technique and care can help to reduce complications and promote healing in the affected areas.
And it has already been cauterized above the mouth of the stomach, and it is more severe; and then it should be treated with what proceeds. This suggests that the author is recommending additional treatment or care for a patient who has undergone cauterization above the stomach, likely to address any residual pain or inflammation in the area. The phrase "es mays derier" may suggest that the condition is more severe or advanced, and requires additional intervention beyond simple cauterization.
Chapter 8.
Chapter 8: On the Cauterization of Forgetfulness Caused by Flame
It is appropriate to give the patient garlic and large pills that soften in the beginning. This suggests that the author is recommending the use of certain natural remedies or medications as a preliminary treatment for forgetfulness caused by flame, before proceeding with cauterization. Garlic may have been used for its anti-inflammatory properties, while the "large pills" may have contained various herbs or minerals to promote healing and memory function.
And then shave all of the patient's head and place on their jugular vein an ointment plaster as described in the treatise on plasters. This suggests that the author is recommending a specific type of topical treatment to be applied to the affected area, after the initial use of natural remedies or medications. The phrase "ras le cap tot" may suggest that the entire head should be shaved, potentially to reduce the risk of infection or to improve the absorption of the ointment plaster.
And place that on several occasions, because that is the manner of cauterization. This suggests that the ointment plaster should be applied to the affected area repeatedly over a period of time, in order to achieve the desired effects of cauterization. The phrase "alcunas veguadas" may suggest that the plaster should be applied several times, or for several days, depending on the severity and duration of the condition. And do that according to this methodical order, as I have already said. This suggests that the author has provided specific instructions for performing the cauterization procedure, and is now emphasizing the importance of following those instructions carefully. The phrase "meteys orde" may suggest a systematic or methodical approach to treatment, with clear steps and procedures to be followed in order to ensure safe and effective care.
And so, if they heal well with those treatments; otherwise, then perform three cauterizations on the back of their head, which should be descending from the highest part of the head to the lower part of the neck. This suggests that the author is recommending a series of cauterizations in specific locations on the back of the head, if initial treatments are not effective. The phrase "descendentz de la partida pus sobirana del cap entro a la partida pus dejos del col" may suggest that the cauterizations should be performed along a descending line from the highest point of the skull to the lower part of the neck, potentially covering a large area of the back of the head. And place the width of a finger between each cauterization, and then carefully cure the cautery with what has proceeded. This suggests that the author is recommending a specific spacing between each cauterization, potentially to reduce the risk of infection or damage to surrounding tissue. The phrase "la grossetut del dit" may suggest that the width of the finger should be used as a guide for spacing the cauterizations.
If you add [more of the] medicine and the patient tolerates it, then apply cautery to the same spot; and if he needs more, then cauterize that area on both ears. (I'm not entirely sure about "both ears" at the end, but I believe "les dos corns" refers to the tips or corners of something, perhaps the feet or the areas where the cold humors have infiltrated.)
Then heal the wound now that it is healed; and use an olive-shaped cautery, as previously described. (I assume "aprop cura" means "heal now," indicating that the previous medical treatment has been successful, and "cauteri olivar" refers to a cautery tool shaped like an olive.)
Chapter 9. (This is simply the title of the next section of the text, which would have been written as a separate chapter in the original document.)
On the cauterization of parazils (perhaps a variant spelling of "parasites" or some other medical condition) and the softening of the entire body. (I assume "cauterization" refers to using hot instruments or substances to treat medical conditions, while "softening" may refer to massages, ointments, or other forms of soothing treatment.)
It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head with lard and what we have mentioned; and then shave the patient's head, and cauterize that area on the same spot on the head, and also cauterize all the tips or corners of the head, and also cauterize the back of the head, and also three times on the spondyls (vertebrae) of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening the body with too much [of something], and the patients tolerate it and the illness is severe, then cauterize that area with four cautery tools on the spondyls (vertebrae) of the back, and specifically with a cautery tool inside the cavity so that it reaches deeply into the spine but not too far, and raise the patient's hips. And then heal the wound now that it is healed, and use an olive-shaped cautery.
Chapter 10. (This is simply the title of the next section of the text, which would have been written as a separate chapter in the original document.)
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic should not be cauterized, except when the epilepsy is caused by a fleuma (phlegm).
And so it is necessary to cleanse the brain of the patient at the beginning, with yeras (perhaps a variant spelling of "yervas," meaning herbs) and with the other cure that we have mentioned in the division, when the illness is severe and the patient can tolerate the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer laxatives and chewable substances to the servant who will cleanse [the patient], for many days, with beneficial foods.
And then shave the patient's head, and cauterize that area on the same spot on the head with a cautery tool, as previously described, and also cauterize the back of the head, and each corner or tip of the head should be cauterized. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize that area with the cauteries that I have mentioned, in a paralyzing and softening way on the spondyls (vertebrae) of the neck and the back.
And use an olive-shaped cautery, as previously described. (I assume "aprop cura" means "heal now," indicating that the previous medical treatment has been successful, and "cauteri olivar" refers to a cautery tool shaped like an olive.)
But if the patient is a child, then use a subtle cautery in this way. (I assume "pausa" means use or apply, and "subtil" refers to something small, fine, or gentle, perhaps indicating that a smaller or less invasive cautery tool should be used for children.)
Chapter 11. (This is simply the title of the next section of the text, which would have been written as a separate chapter in the original document.)
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt and thick phlegm, then cauterize that area with the cauteries that I have mentioned in the section on paralysis. (I assume "cauteris" means cautery tools or substances, and "paralisi" refers to a previous section of the text where cauterization was discussed as a treatment for paralysis.)
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess declining towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give them to drink something that purifies the brain, as previously mentioned in the division. (I assume "divisio" means section or chapter, referring to an earlier part of the text where a treatment for melancholy was discussed. The sentence suggests that when melancholy is caused by an excess of humors that are declining towards depression, then the patient should be given something to drink that purifies their brain, perhaps in order to restore balance and alleviate symptoms.)
And then shave the patient's head, and then make a proper tourniquet from it on the circle (perhaps referring to a band or ring-shaped instrument), and then place that in the same spot on the head.
And the patient should be sixty years old and held in high regard.
And then apply a liniment; and it is more worthy of being used than an old sheep's wool. And heat that over the fire with moderate warmth, which the patient will endure when it is applied to them. And then apply that in the same spot on the patient's head, within the circle, and leave it there until it has cooled down.
And do that with the patient once a week, with the other good regimen of theirs until they are healed; or if you wish, cauterize that by making small points according to their size, as long as you have a cautery tool ready in this way: this is a type of cautery tool that moistens the brain with equal balance.
And then apply that piece soaked in wool or linen cloth.
Chapter 12. (This is simply the title of the next section of the text, which would have been written as a separate chapter in the original document.)
On the cauterization of water that descends into the ear.
When you have determined the beginning of water in the ear by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink something that purifies their head, and keep them away from all moisture.
And cause them to sweat in a bath for several days.
And command them to shave their head, and cauterize that in the same spot on the head; and then cauterize that with two cautery tools on both temples if it is the beginning of water flowing into both ears, or on one temple if it is the beginning of water flowing into one ear.
Incise with a cautery tool all the veins and arteries which are below the spine; and let the cauterizations be in that place at a distance equal to the width of the temples.
And be careful of bleeding when it is cauterized; and if you see any bleeding, stop it with some medicine, which is within your means.
I will come with knowledge in the extraction of arteries, and in the incision of those affected by abscess and caution in controlling bleeding.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize the area below the two skull bones with two specifically placed cauteries.
Chapter 13.[note] It's important to note that in medieval medical texts, the capitalization rules we use today were not always followed. I will capitalize "Chapter" for clarity, but the rest of the words in the chapter heading will retain their original case.
Chapter 13: On the Cautery of Ancient Tears.
When the tears of the eyes become chronic and are caused by veins and arteries in the visible part of the head, and it is confirmed that this is due to excessive and inflamed pulsations, then cauterize that area with a cautery, as mentioned in the chapter on water in the eyes. Also cauterize the middle part of the forehead and two cauteries at the temples, as well as two cauteries at the back of the skull below the two temporal bones. And if it is necessary, then cauterize that area on the side of the eye at the base of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.[note] Again, I will capitalize "Chapter" for clarity while retaining the original case for the rest of the words in the chapter heading.
Chapter 14: On the Cautery of Foul Smells from the Nose.
When you treat that condition with what we have mentioned in the division (Chapter 13) and your treatment is not effective, then prepare and give the patient to drink boiled eggs for three nights; and shave the patient's head, and cauterize them with a medium-sized round cautery on the crown of their head. And shave the hair above the eyebrows slightly, then cauterize that area with two nail-shaped cauteries on both eyebrows.
And take care not to burn or damage the artery.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.[note] Again, I will capitalize "Chapter" for clarity while retaining the original case for the rest of the words in the chapter heading.
Chapter 15: On the Cautery of Softening the Eyelids of the Eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes softened due to illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a crescent-shaped cautery, and this is its shape:
And if you wish, cauterize that area above the eyebrows with two small cauteries, spaced apart, and make them elongated along the temples. And let the length of each cautery correspond to the width of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but only so that the outer third of the eyelid becomes seared.
Chapter 16.[note] Again, I will capitalize "Chapter" for clarity while retaining the original case for the rest of the words in the chapter heading.
Chapter 16: On the Cautery of the Eyelid of the Eye when the Eyebrows are Turned Inward and Squeeze the Eye.
When the eyebrows are turned inward so that they poke the eye, there are two ways to cauterize that area: either with a hot cautery or with a burning medicine.
If you use a hot cautery, then instruct the patient to read aloud while pulling their eyebrows outward, extending and straightening them as if cleaning them. And if it pokes their eyes, then strengthen the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not harmed until their eyebrows have grown back.
And when they have grown back and become straight, then place a sign on the patient's head indicating that their eyebrows are growing back correctly, and place a mark above the eyelids of the patient using a symbol that resembles the shape of a mermaid's tail, with the beginning of the symbol positioned near the eyebrows.
And place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or mucilage made from psyllium seeds on the eye.
And place an ignited cautery of this shape on it.
And cauterize over the mark that you have made, little by little, in a series of small, evenly-spaced burns, until the surface of the skin has been completely burned away and appears similar to the shape of a myrtle leaf, with all its details clearly visible.
And the sign of good health for this procedure is that you see the eyelid of the eye contracted and the eyebrows raised above the puncture of the eye.
And so raise your hand and leave it there for three days, and place a bandage on the wound until it is healed. And apply a poultice to it until it is healed.
But if it returns because of some cause and the skin has softened, then do the cautery again in the same way as you did before.[translated by machine learning tools]
But if the eyelashes have fallen out, then cauterize the area until it heals and returns to its natural place, so that the lashes do not harm the eye.[translated by machine learning tools][Original text is in medieval medical language]
But use the caustic medicine that you command the patient to apply until the hair grows back and heals, and make a leaf-shaped plaster of paper or cloth like that of myrtle.[translated by machine learning tools]
And take good quality soap and mix it with living coal powder in a lump. [translated by machine learning tools][Original text is in medieval medical language] That is, That is, take those things and mix them well, and do this quickly so that they are not chilled. Then spread this mixture on the paper made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the wound or both. Place a bandage soaked in egg white under the patient's head. And let the patient lie on their back.
And place the patient's fingers on the medicine and press gently, but not too hard, until the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for this burning sensation is similar to that of fire.
And when you notice that the burning sensation has stopped, then remove your hand from the medicine. Then wash the area with water. Then consider if the eyelid is lifted as it should be after being washed. If so, then the procedure is done. But if not, return to the area where the medicine was not applied and do not damage the skin until it heals. And then contract the wound by applying heat or cutting it, for then it will be healed.[translated by machine learning tools] [Original text is in medieval medical language]
And place a bandage on the wound until the scar of the incision has healed. And treat it with a specific ointment or another one until it is cured.
And in your treatment, you must be vigilant to ensure that no residue of the medicine falls into the eye. And if for several days the eyelid remains soft and some hair has entered the wound, then repeat the treatment on the area where the eyelid is softened, just as you did at the beginning. And continue until it is healed.[translated by machine learning tools] [Original text is in medieval medical language]
This is the shape of myrtle leaf.
And know that the wounds of men are different in size and smallness, and therefore the contraction should be done according to this.
And let not the way of righteousness be hidden from one who studies this art.
Chapter XVII.
Chapter XVII: On the Cauterization of Fistulas Located in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the section on diseases and do not follow the correct treatment method, it is necessary for you to cauterize it in the following manner: Command the patient to place their head on your lap, and have some assistant hold the patient's head steady between his or her hands in such a way that they are not harmed or agitated by moving their head.
And place a piece of cloth soaked in egg white or muslin on the patient's eye.
And apply the heated cautery, which has this shape:
which is concave and has the shape of a reed or the talon of a vulture at one end where the cautery is made. This passage refers to the specific tool used in the procedure, describing its shape or form as being concave, similar to the shape of a reed or the talon of a vulture. The text likely indicates that this particular shape is ideal for the procedure because it allows for better precision and control when applying the cautery to the fistula.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating at the other end. This passage is describing an optional feature of the cautery tool. The text indicates that the cautery can optionally have a sharp or pointed end for penetrating deeper into the tissue, if desired. This additional feature would allow for more precise control and the ability to treat fistulas located in different depths within the lacrimal duct. [translated by machine learning tools] And if you want, it can be as long as a probe. This passage is describing another optional feature of the cautery tool. The text indicates that the length of the cautery can be adjusted to match the depth and size of the fistula. By making it as long as a probe, the surgeon would have more control and precision when applying the cautery to the affected area. This feature is useful in treating larger or deeper fistulas. [translated by machine learning tools]
However, one that is concave is better for this work. The text here emphasizes the importance of using a cautery tool that is concave in shape. This is because such a tool is better suited for treating fistulas located within the lacrimal duct, as it allows for more precise control and less risk of damaging surrounding tissue. By stating that this shape is "better" for the procedure, the text indicates that it is the preferred option among medical practitioners. [translated by machine learning tools] [Original text is in medieval medical language]
And then press the fistula if it is open, and remove any pus or dry it out. This passage describes the next step in the procedure, which is to apply pressure to the fistula if it is open. The purpose of this step is to remove any pus or fluid that has accumulated within the fistula. By applying pressure and removing the pus, the surgeon can then proceed to dry out the affected area using the cautery tool. This is an important step in the healing process, as it helps to prevent infection and promote proper closure of the fistula. And if it's not open, then open it and extract the pus from it. This passage describes what to do if the fistula is not already open. The surgeon must first make an incision in order to access the affected area. Once this has been done, the next step is to remove any pus or debris that has accumulated within the fistula. This is a crucial part of the healing process, as it helps to prevent infection and further damage to the surrounding tissue. By removing the pus and debris, the surgeon can then proceed with the cauterization process in order to promote proper closure of the fistula.
And then place the heated cautery on it, being sure that it is well lit and hold your hand close to the cautery of the eye near its departure from the nose so that you do not make a mistake or cause discomfort to the patient. Then place the cautery in the grooves of the eye and destroy the diseased tissue.
And so if at the beginning of your cauterization you reach the bone, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary, and leave it in place for three days. Then place a bandage over the wound and cover it with a drying ointment until it heals.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply an acrid corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped as appropriate in its chapter. This passage provides additional instructions for treating a fistula that has not healed after 10 days of treatment. The text advises the use of an acrid corrosive medicine to expose the bone and scrape it as needed, which is likely a reference to debridement, the process of removing dead or infected tissue to promote healing. This passage likely refers to a specific chapter in the medical text that provides more detailed instructions on this procedure, emphasizing the importance of proper technique and caution when using corrosive medicines.[translated by machine learning tools] [Original text is in medieval medical language]
Here is another method of cauterization for a fistula which we mentioned earlier: Understand the location of the fistula and open it carefully, then place this subtle probe in it with the shape of: A probe was made with one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand carefully, and do not harm the patient so that the molten lead does not reach the eye of that person; and it is necessary to place a cloth soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye, because lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it with miraculous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a probe of the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as will be described in its proper place. This passage provides an alternative solution if the fistula does not heal through cauterization and treatment. The text advises to use a probe of the nose to reduce the fistula back into the body of the nose, this procedure is also known as nasal packing which helps to close off the opening and allow for proper healing. This passage likely refers to a specific chapter or section in the medical text that provides more detailed instructions on this procedure.
Chapter XVIII.
Chapter XVIII: On the Cauterization of Wounds on the Feet.
Often cracks occur in the lips, and more commonly in the lips of infants. This passage is describing a common problem with lip cracking that often happens to people and especially to infants. The text is likely indicating that these cracks can be painful and difficult to heal, which makes them a concern for medical practitioners. It's possible that this chapter will discuss different methods of treating these cracks, including the use of ointments, creams, or other topical treatments. [translated by machine learning tools]
And so when you treat those cracks with what we have said in the previous sections and it does not improve your treatment, then heat the small knife-shaped cautery according to this form that is taught:
And let its concavity be according to the fineness of a knife. This passage refers to the shape or form of the cautery tool that will be used for treating lip cracks. The text advises that the concavity of the cautery should match the shape and size of a knife, this is likely because such a shape allows for better precision and control when applying the cautery to the affected area, which would minimize the risk of damaging surrounding tissue. This passage highlights the importance of proper technique and caution when using this treatment, as it involves heat and can potentially cause harm if not done correctly. [translated by machine learning tools]
And then place the tip of it carefully in those cracks until the cautery reaches the root of the cracks. This passage is describing the final step in the procedure, which is to apply the heated cautery to the affected area. The surgeon must ensure that the tip of the cautery is placed carefully and precisely in the cracks, so that it reaches the root of the problem. This is important for ensuring that the procedure is carried out safely and effectively, as it helps to prevent infection and further damage to the surrounding tissue. By placing the tip of the cautery carefully, the surgeon can then proceed with the next step of the procedure in order to promote proper healing of the affected area. [translated by machine learning tools]
And then treat it with ointments until it heals. This passage is describing the final step in the procedure, which is to apply ointment to the affected area after cauterization. The use of ointment helps to prevent infection and promote proper healing of the affected area. By applying ointment, the surgeon can ensure that the wound is properly cared for and that the patient recovers fully from the procedure. This passage highlights the importance of proper aftercare in promoting proper closure of the wound and preventing further infection or damage to the surrounding tissue.

Chapter XIX.
Chapter XIX: On the Cauterization of Fistulas in the Mouth
When an abscess develops in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth, and it breaks open, becomes old, forms a fistula, and you treat it but it does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with the appropriate amount of heat according to its size. And place the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand so that the heated iron reaches the root of the problem. And at the end of this procedure, do it once or twice; and then treat it with the care that we have described until it heals.
And so if the pus is lanced and healed, it's good; otherwise, it is necessary to expose the area and clean the rotten bone as described in its section.
Chapter 20. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.)
On the cautery of teeth and softening of gums. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "dentz" refers to teeth and "mollificacio" means softening or making pliable.)
When the gums are softened by moisture and teeth are rotten, and you have treated them with medicines but to no avail, then place the patient's head in your lap, light the cautery with a shape that will come here soon, and quickly place the hot tip on the tooth and bring it close to the gum without touching it. Keep your hand slightly away from the flame so that the patient feels only moderate heat on their tooth as the flame approaches. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "quanula" means hot tip or cautery, and "festinantment" means quickly.)
Then lift your hand, and apply the cautery again as many times as you wish. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "alcunas veguadas" means several times or repeatedly.)
Then have the patient fill their mouth with saltwater and hold it for an hour, then spit it out, because the rotten tooth is now closed and the softened gum is strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried up. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "aygua de sal" means saltwater, "stupa" means spit or rinse, and "exsiccada" means dried up.)
Chapter 21. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.)
On the cautery of toothache. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "dolor de dent" means toothache.)
When toothache is caused by coldness or a worm in it, and you have not found a cure with medicine, then there are two ways to use cautery: either with a cow's horn cautery or with fire. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "boder de vacas" means cow's horn cautery.)
The cow's horn cautery is done by taking a cow's horn and heating it in the coals of a fire. Then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the horn, then dip the hot horn in water and quickly place it on the painful tooth until it becomes warm. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "coto" means cloth or rag, and "enfregidat" means warmed up.)
Then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the teeth. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "vertut" means power or effect.)
If you prefer, soak a piece of wool or cloth in the hot horn and place it on the painful tooth, then hold the red-hot iron over it until the heat reaches the core of the cavity in the tooth. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "preon" means core or center.)
However, the cautery with fire is done by using an iron or copper probe that has some thickness and is not too sharp, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "eram" means iron and "cor" means core.)
Then light the cautery with a shape that will come, and place it on the tooth while holding your hand over it until the cautery becomes warm. Repeat this several times to reduce the pain either on the same day or the next day. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "sira" means will be.)
And it is important that after using the cautery, the patient fills their mouth with good broth and keeps it there for an hour before spitting it out. This is the method of cauterization. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "bon boder" means good broth or liquid.)
And cauterize whichever end you can, as much as it is possible for you to do so. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "extremittat" means end or edge.)
And this is the form of the cannula. (A cannula was a small metal tube used in various medical procedures, including bloodletting and irrigation.)
Chapter 22. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.)
On the cautery of umbilical hernias or protrusions. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "extrophulos" refers to umbilical hernias or protrusions.)
When an umbilical hernia or protrusion is caused by a membrane and cold humors and does not respond to gentle massage with medicines, then you should cauterize it gently with the following shape: the cautery has two sharp ends so that smoke can escape from both sides. Place the red-hot tip of the cautery on the hernia once, and repeat if necessary until the heat reaches the core of the swelling. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "apostema" means swelling or abscess.)
If the swelling is small, then cauterize it according to its size and leave it for three days before placing a cloth soaked in oil on it until the burn has healed. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "leyssa" means leave or wait, and "boder" means fat or ointment.)
Then treat it with a salve and bandages until it heals. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "enguent" means salve or ointment.)
Chapter 23. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.)
On the cautery of hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "ravquiera" means hoarseness or roughness of voice, and "ale" means throat or windpipe.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ravquiera](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ravquiera)
When humors accumulate in the windpipe, especially when it is due to a cold complexion, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize the affected area at the base of the throat. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "golayro" means Adam's apple or thyroid cartilage.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/golayro](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/golayro)
And be careful not to burn the thyroid cartilage or the windpipe with the cautery, but only slightly. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "codena" means windpipe.)
Then use another cautery to burn the joint of the neck at the base of the spine. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "derier" means lower or posterior, and "espondil" means vertebra.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/derier](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/derier) And let the shape of the cautery be as follows: (It's not clear what "clavilh" means in this context, but it could refer to a particular type of cautery or instrument.)
Then treat the area with the methods described earlier until it heals. (This sentence refers back to previous instructions for treating an injury or condition, but it's not clear from the context what those methods were.)
Chapter 24. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.)
On the cautery of lung disease and cough. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "malautia" means illness or disease, and "tos" means cough or hacking.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malautia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malautia)
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humors and the patient does not have a fever or tuberculosis and has had the condition for some time, then use two cauteries on the breastbone in the depressed areas between the ribs and the nipples. Let the cauteries be shaped as described earlier. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "furcula" means breastbone or sternum, and "leontz e buoytz" means ribs.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/furcula](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/furcula)
And if you prefer, use a pointed cautery called "puncta," the shape of which is described earlier in the section on earache. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "ponctacio" means section or chapter.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ponctacio](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ponctacio)
And make small holes with the pointed cautery, and then treat the area with the methods described earlier until it heals. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "meteys" means remedies or treatments.)
And let the cautery have three prongs, so that you can use it to make three burns at once in this manner: (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "ramp" means prong or tine.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ramp](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ramp)
Chapter 25. (Capitol is a way of referring to chapters in this text.) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulum)
On the cautery of itching, which is the head or top of the penis. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "titillic" refers to genital itching or irritation.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/titillic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/titillic)
When the head of the penis is dislocated due to slippery humors and does not return to its normal position in time, then you must first reduce the dislocation by gently moving it back into place while the patient is lying on their side or back. Then elevate the windpipe with your left hand, lifting it upwards towards the abdomen, if the joint is dislocated towards the inside of the body. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "citillic" means penis, and "codena" means windpipe or trachea.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/citillic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/citillic)
And light the cautery with two tips, which has this shape: (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "caps" means tips or ends.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/caps](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/caps)
Then use the two-tipped cautery to burn the windpipe until it penetrates into the other side; and this is the shape of the cauterization: (This sentence seems to be referring back to an earlier passage about using a cautery to treat a dislocated penis, but it's not entirely clear what "the other side" means in this context. It could refer to burning through the windpipe and into the abdominal cavity or another nearby structure.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iv](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iv)
And sometimes it is appropriate to adjust the shape according to this count, and that's why there are eight cauteries. (It's not entirely clear what "this count" refers to, but it could be related to an earlier passage about measuring the thickness or width of the skin. The text suggests that there are eight different shapes or types of cauterization, each with its own specific purpose and application.) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comte](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comte)
Then place the cautery on a piece of porous cotton soaked with salt, and have the patient rest quietly while the member is not harmed for some time until it is healed. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "porys cuytz" means porous cotton or gauze.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/porys](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/porys)
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part and this procedure is done late, then use a pointed cautery or several small cauteries to burn the muscle, so that the joint is strengthened, the moisture is reduced, and the patient is healed. (In this translation, I made an educated guess that "motz" means many or several.)[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motz](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motz)
Chapter 26
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and turbid humors enter the stomach and multiply there, causing it to expand beyond its normal size, if you continue with treatment methods without addressing the root cause, then it is necessary for the patient to be propped up on their back, stretch out their arms and legs, and apply cauterization to the area with three cautery tools: one below the chest by a finger's width with a pointed cautery tip, and two more below each side of the cautery tool until it forms a triangular shape; leave space between them so that they do not touch, causing scorching.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of a hazelnut.
And let the shape of the cautery be as follows, and if you wish, cauterize with a large tool in the middle of the stomach, shaped like this: and this should be a tool shaped like a circle, similar to this form. [Note: The text does not provide an actual diagram or drawing for the shapes described. Instead, it directs the reader to use their imagination to visualize the forms.]
And let the stomach be cauterized by puncturing at a point that is far from this cautery tool, for those who are afraid of it: and it should be done by placing the cautery tool over the desired spot on the stomach, according to the size you want with a probe, and then cauterize at these points; and cure it with the treatment that precedes healing until it is healed. [Note: This passage suggests that the cauterization procedure may have been done in stages or iteratively, rather than all at once. It also implies that patients might be afraid of the cautery tool, which was a common concern during medieval medical procedures.][\*]
Chapter 27. (The chapter numbers continue to increase by one, indicating that this is the next chapter in the text.)
On the cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness or humidity or excessive flatulence that causes it to expand beyond its normal size through superfluous egression, and if the patient is not cured by the methods mentioned earlier, then it is necessary for the patient to be propped up on their back with their head raised, and place three cautery tools according to this shape and quantity below the hypochondrium area of the liver, where the body's imprint can be seen. [Note: The text suggests that the cauterization procedure should only be used if other treatments have failed, and that it is important to position the patient properly before proceeding with the treatment.]
And let the space between each cautery tool be the width of a finger, and let the cautery tools be the length of an upright forearm. (Note: The text suggests that the cautery tools should be spaced apart by the width of a finger, and that they should be the length of an upright forearm.)
And do not press too hard with the cautery tool. (Note: The text warns against applying excessive pressure when using the cautery tool, which could cause burns or other injuries to the patient.)
And if the quantity of what adheres is equal to the size of a hazelnut, and not any larger; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them be seated with their limbs stretched out, and raise their arms. (Note: The text provides additional instructions for positioning the patient during cauterization, depending on the size of the area to be treated.)
And it is possible for you to cauterize with these cautery tools using a knife-shaped cautery, if you have skill and prudence in the art. (Note: This passage suggests that there were different types of cautery tools available during medieval medicine, including knife-shaped ones. The text implies that the reader should use whichever tool they are most skilled with, as long as they exercise caution and careful judgement when performing the procedure.)
And take care not to overdo it in the cauterization, and make sure that the entire hazelnut-sized piece of flesh is cauterized so that the whole body is affected and the heat reaches the intestines, because the liver is delicate; and know this. (Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of caution when performing cauterization, particularly on delicate areas like the liver. It suggests that overdoing it could cause harm to the patient, and that the practitioner should be aware of the limitations and potential risks of the procedure.)
Chapter 28. (Note: The text continues with the next chapter in the series.)
On puncturing a liver abscess with a cautery tool.
When there is an abscess or swelling in the liver and you want to know if it is within the liver tissue itself or the surrounding membrane, then if it is within the liver tissue, the patient will experience heaviness and increased pain without any fever. (Note: The text suggests that the location of the abscess within the liver may affect the symptoms experienced by the patient. It implies that an abscess located in the liver tissue itself may cause more severe pain and discomfort than one located in the surrounding membrane.) [*]
And if it is in the membrane surrounding the liver, then the pain will be intense and may exhaust even experienced doctors during treatment. (Note: This passage suggests that an abscess located in the membrane surrounding the liver may cause more severe symptoms than one located within the liver tissue itself. It implies that this type of abscess may require more extensive or intensive treatment, which could be physically and mentally challenging for both the patient and the medical practitioner.)
Therefore it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back; and then locate the site of the abscess with a probe; and then heat the knife-shaped cautery tool, which has been described in the previous page, over a fire until it glows red-hot. (Note: This passage provides additional instructions for puncturing an abscess in the liver using a cautery tool. It emphasizes the importance of proper positioning and careful location of the abscess before proceeding with the procedure.) [*] And cauterize with that knife-shaped tool until the entire liver is compressed and the heat reaches the gallbladder, until pus is produced. (Note: This passage suggests that the goal of cauterization in this case is to penetrate deeply into the liver tissue, compressing it and applying heat until pus is produced. It implies that this may require multiple passes with the knife-shaped tool, gradually increasing the depth and intensity of the burns until the desired effect is achieved.)
And then treat it with other methods for treating abscesses until it heals completely. (Note: This passage suggests that cauterization alone may not be sufficient to treat an abscess in the liver, and that other methods may also be necessary. It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive treatment and ongoing care to ensure complete healing.)
And it is not advisable for anyone but those with extensive medical training and experience to perform this type of cautery procedure; however, even experienced practitioners should approach it with caution and careful consideration, as there are risks involved. (Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of expertise and skill when performing medical procedures like cauterization, particularly on delicate organs like the liver. It suggests that while some level of confidence and experience is necessary to perform these procedures effectively, it is also important to recognize their limitations and potential risks, and to approach them with caution and careful judgement.)
Chapter 29. (Note: The text continues with the next chapter in the series.)
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients used to perform cauterization for pleurisy using this method, which involves taking a dry, pointed rod of aristology (a type of plant or herb) that is about the length and thickness of a finger. (Note: This passage suggests that medieval medical practitioners often relied on traditional techniques and remedies when performing procedures like cauterization. It implies that these methods were passed down from earlier generations, and may have been based on empirical observations or folk knowledge.) [*]
Then submerge the rod in oil and heat it over a fire until it is hot enough to perform cauterization. Next, use the heated rod to cauterize the area between the collarbone and the ribcage; apply two small cautery tools on either side of the throat, slightly below the jawline; place two more cautery tools in the area where the fifth rib meets the spine, slightly angled towards the back; add another cautery tool on the lower abdomen, just above the navel; and three more tools along the spine, at equal intervals. Finally, apply a single cautery tool between the shoulder blades, two more along the sides of the hips, below the waistline, and one last tool in the center of the back, between the shoulder blades. (Note: This passage provides detailed instructions for performing cauterization on various parts of the body to treat pleurisy. It emphasizes the importance of careful positioning and placement of the cautery tools, as well as proper heating and preparation.) [*]
And do not press too hard with the cautery tool, but rather work gently and carefully on the surface of the liver. (Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of gentle, careful application when performing cauterization on delicate organs like the liver. It suggests that excessive force or pressure could cause damage or injury to the organ, and may compromise the effectiveness of the treatment.)
And some ancient physicians used to use a cautery tool made of iron in the shape of a ray, and would apply it to the area between the ribs until it reached the abscess and expelled pus, similar to what we described for liver abscesses. (Note: This passage suggests that medieval medical practitioners may have used different types of cautery tools depending on the specific condition being treated. It implies that iron cauterization tools were also commonly used, and that they could be shaped or fashioned in various ways to suit the needs of the procedure.) [*]
But there is risk involved in puncturing an abscess with a cautery tool, as it can cause death or injury if done improperly, particularly in cases where the abscess has formed a fistula that does not heal properly. (Note: This passage emphasizes the potential risks and dangers of using cauterization to treat abscesses, particularly if the procedure is not performed correctly. It suggests that there may be complications or consequences associated with puncturing an abscess, particularly if it has formed a fistula that does not heal properly.) [*]
Chapter 30. (Note: The text continues with the next chapter in the series.) [*]
On the Cauterization of the Spleen
When you treat illnesses of the spleen with what we have said about treatment in the division and do not agree with your treatment, then cauterization is necessary in three ways, all of which are correct, one of which is that you make three or four linear incisions along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, the figure of which has been presented earlier.
And let the width between each cautery be the thickness of a finger or slightly more, and let the method of cauterization be the same as that which we described for liver cauteries earlier.
And do not press too hard with the cautery tool, and let the patient lie on their back.
And another way to cauterize is to heat the two-pronged cautery tool, which we mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and elevate the liver that lies in front of the spleen where the patient's left side rests.
And let your elevation be according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries are made according to the width of the body. (Note: This passage suggests that the two-pronged cautery tool should be used to lift or elevate the liver, allowing the physician to make cauterization incisions along the width of the body rather than the length. This may help ensure more even and consistent heating, as well as reduce the risk of injury to surrounding tissues.) [*]
And then insert gently the two purgatives, ignite slightly, in the opening where the intestines penetrate from the other side.
Then apply the cautery; and so four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three purgatives.
Then you should treat the cauterization wound that has been left open for too many days by letting it gradually close up, as this is more comfortable than other previous causes of discomfort.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of dropsy.
The cautery should not be used in cases of dropsy generally, but only in specific instances where it is appropriate.
When you are treating dropsy using the methods of treatment that have been mentioned in the previous discussion and your treatment is not effective, then it is appropriate to use cautery in four locations around the abdomen, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one at the right side of the chest, and one more on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be appropriate to the thickness of the intestines.
And leave the cautery open for a long time so that it drains well.
And do not move the patient from treatment to the cautery without proper care, as this can add two complications and hinder their recovery.
The shape of the cautery used for cauterizing the abdomen should be like a key, as described earlier, and the one used for cauterizing the back should be like an olive branch, also as previously described.
Chapter 32.
On the cauterization of feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with black water, it is appropriate to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot between the auricular (outer ankle) and the anular (inner ankle), using a cautery that touches the skin without breaking it. Lift your hand with the cautery, do not twist it, and also lift your other hand, but do not return it completely, as this can cause the black water to spill out.
The cautery should be shaped as follows: And make two cauteries on each thigh, and in each thigh make a cautery with the tip of a knife-shaped cautery. And let the cauteries be the length of the thigh, with one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries should be made.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water drains from it.
And then treat it with the causes that we have mentioned earlier.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdominal wall.
When the abdominal wall is weak and damp due to a disturbance in digestive and retentive functions, which are located in the stomach and intestines, then it should be treated with the methods of treatment that have been mentioned earlier and if necessary, perform a cauterization that promotes function. If the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the area over the stomach with a large cautery, as described in the previous chapter on stomach cauterization, using the circular cautery and four subtle subcutaneous cauteries around the navel, using a small key-shaped cautery; and use a large olive-shaped cautery or two cauteries over the bladder.
And if sometimes there is excessive dampness and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize over the epigastric region and on the intestines, and lightly apply two cauteries near the stomach and close to the inguinal regions, as this is a perfect cure with which you will not go wrong.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When hemorrhoids are of a nature that is prone to becoming old and thickened or are caused by corrupt humors, and have been treated with the methods mentioned earlier but still require further care, then cauterize three times over the pus located below the small triangular spine at the base of the spine, and use a cautery twice directly above the navel.
And if you suspect that the stomach is congested and the food is not digested properly, and the face appears swollen or puffy, then cauterize the area over the stomach with a large cautery as described earlier, and use one cautery on the liver and another on the spleen using a small key-shaped cautery. Leave the cauteries open for some time to allow for drainage, and then treat the underlying condition until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of hernia near its rupture.
When you perform an incision on a hernia, then you should cauterize the wound using a pointed or needle-like cautery. Then insert the cautery into the hernia incision and gently push it towards the opening of the vein from which the blood flows, using your other hand to guide the cautery to the site.
And do this once or twice, but if there are many hernias, then cauterize each one as described earlier, and then treat them with appropriate dressings until they are healed.
And if you use a large cautery on a swelling, it will be more effective in promoting healing.
Chapter 36.
On the cauterization of fistulas that are naturally formed in the body's divisions.
When nature does not comply with the treatment that has been recommended for a particular condition, and the patient is frightened by this, then cauterization should be used to promote healing.
Therefore, when you see a fistula in the natural divisions of the body that is old and has become corrupted with pus and dampness, it is more appropriate to treat it with subtle care and to carefully assess its depth using the previously mentioned technique.
Then use a pointed or needle-like cautery tool. And then insert the cautery tool into the fistula and carefully assess its depth using the previously mentioned technique.
And then move the cautery tool back and forth over the fistula until the corrupt tissue has been burned away, doing this once or twice or three times as necessary based on your assessment of the situation.
And be careful not to burn the nerves or blood vessels; and if the fistula extends into the bladder or intestines, then avoid using cautery in those areas. Only use cautery when the fistula is located in a fleshy area that you believe is not too deep.
And then treat the area until it has healed.
And if the area is sealed and the matter has been drained from it, and it remains in this state for a long time, then you should know that it has healed completely.
And if the matter is not drained from it, then you should know that it may be deep-seated or located in a place where the tissue has become corrupted, or it may be due to one of the underlying causes mentioned earlier in its appropriate context.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of piles (hemorrhoids).
When hemorrhoids become painful due to cold or excessive swelling, and as a result the patient is weakened, then it is appropriate to use a pointed cautery tool on each individual hemorrhoid, being careful to avoid causing further damage or injury.
And quickly apply a moderate cautery to the second degree, which will bring three linear cauteries, and then they will be more effective in helping.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When a weakness and softening occurs in the bladder due to cold and moisture, such that the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize that area with a pointed cautery at the lowest point of the bladder, where the skin of the pubic region begins. Cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left.
And the length of each cautery should correspond to the depth of the ulcer; and cauterize with a single cautery at the lowest point on the back, or with two if necessary.
And let the cautery be spike-shaped, as is customary.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the uterus.
When the uterus experiences cold and moisture, which prohibits conception, causes corruption of menstrual blood, delays the onset of menstruation, and results in pain during their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize the area with three spike-shaped cauteries along the circumference of the navel, as was previously described for bladder cauterization. Additionally, cauterize at the lowest point on the back with one spike-shaped cautery or two if needed.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of ankle dislocation.
When moisture and inflammation have infiltrated the ankle area and caused it to protrude from its proper location, a sign of this being that one thigh is longer than the other when compared to each other. And the location of the dislocation is found in that area.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle area with a circular-shaped cautery because you have marked the circumference of that region while it is swollen and positioned in such a way that the affected area falls at the center of the circle.
And let the shape of the cautery be as described in stomach cauterization.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three large olive-shaped cauteries instead.
And the cautery should be made based on the thickness of the entire spine; and then provide care so that it heals properly.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle area and is caused by cold and moisture, then the patient should be treated with what has been previously described and not mentioned here, which is outdated. Therefore, it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors using fetid pills or artificial ones, and then perform cauterization.
And the method of cauterization in this case is twofold: either using combustible substances for cautery or using fire itself.
It can be done in two ways according to medical knowledge, one of which is cauterizing the area on the ankle with three triangular-shaped cauteries as shown here, and doing so with sufficient depth. And let the spaces between each cautery be the width of a finger, and if using large olive-shaped cauteries.
But sometimes it may be necessary for some of the cauteries to be on top of the heel, making a total of four cauteries.
And if desired, you may use the circular-shaped cautery as previously described in ankle dislocation cauterization, ensuring that it encompasses the entire circumference and burns through the thickness of the entire spine.
And this is the method for sciatic cauterization when pain occurs and it adheres to the ankle without extending into the thigh.
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries at this location on the thigh where the patient indicates the source of the discomfort; and one cautery should be placed above the anklebone towards the inner aspect by four fingers' width.
And if using a scalpel-shaped cautery, then the depth of the incision should correspond to the thickness of the spine.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to this location near the toes, then cauterize there with a pointed cautery at three points or four or more as required.
And if the patient complains of pain below the groin towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a scalpel-shaped cautery.
And when performing any type of cauterization, be careful not to overuse the cautery and burn nerves or major blood vessels, as this can cause further harm or injury to the patient.
I have seen some who, while performing this type of cauterization on the ankle, went too far and ended up burning the leg, causing inflammation that spread to the foot and resulted in a tumor that affected the entire limb, ultimately leading to its perforation and corruption. And this can often lead to severe abdominal pain and sometimes even death.
And if pain occurs in two adjacent areas, cauterize each one according to this method.
And wise men have said that in the cauterization of ankle dislocation, the method should be as follows: make a circular iron shape with a circumference equivalent to the width of one hand; and let its opening or orifice be sized according to the thickness of a date seed or slightly smaller.
Inside this circle, there should be another third; and let the spaces between them be equal to the width of a finger; and these circles should be open on two sides. The length of these protrusions should be one or two fingers' width, with the edges of the iron properly prepared in the circles; and this is its shape:
And let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks fly from it; then place it over the affected area of the ankle while the patient lies on their side. And then perform the cauterization using three circular-shaped cauteries in one go.
And let it remain in place for three days, apply an ointment-based poultice to the area and leave it exposed for several days, and then care for the wound with ointments until it heals.
Says Albucasis: "O my sons, we have used this type of cautery sparingly due to the fearsome sight of it, and also because few instances require such a drastic approach."
But the majority of patients can tolerate other forms of cautery, and they will find relief with those methods.
But a cautery made with adhesive substances is preferable, where you create two rings and insert an iron gate in each one; let the walls of these gates be of equal length to two nuts or somewhat smaller.
And let the spaces between each be equivalent to the width of a finger; and these openings should be both above and below, enclosed within this shape:
And then place the cautery over the affected area of the ankle while the patient lies on their side, and press your hand firmly against the site. Take hot water and pour it between two rings, gradually increasing its heat, keeping this up for an hour, allowing the patient to endure the biting sensation and sticking of it (which feels like fire) until the biting sensation ceases.
And then raise your hand with the instrument and clean the whole ankle with warm water and plain water.
Leave it alone for three days and apply it to the affected area until the blister turns black and becomes necrotic, leave it on for several more days, and then the pus will come out; this is the final remedy.
And then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make an incision in it so that it can contain water, just as is done on the ankle with blisters.
And this is the method of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and half a measure of unquenched lime, grind them together and place in a new bowl with a hole in the bottom, so that only as much as enters it can pass through.
And place it under the bottom of the bowl with a hole and pour warm water over the alkali and living lime, which will draw out the liquid through a finger's width, and then press it with a clean hand with good compression, and let the water that drains from it pass through the hole into the second bowl.
And then collect all of that water and pour it over more living lime and fresh alkali, because now it has gained strong potency, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other limbs, because the operation involves fire.
And some of these medicines are used for cauterization, such as zinc oxide and melancontra and lime with soap, which are mixed together.
And Galen recounts the operation and cure used by an ancient doctor to heal pain in the ankle and sciatic vein, which he praises highly and says is not necessary for any other treatment, and that it heals with one application just as it is described, because it easily relieves the inflammation and swelling of that area.
And it is made from green verdigris, and if that cannot be found, use fresh figs instead, which should be ground into a powder with a little salt and applied to the ankle where the pain is, or on the thigh, or leg, and then bandaged.
And it should be left on for three hours or until the patient can bear the pain of the necrosis.
And then place it in warm water and when the body is heated, expose it to the sun, because the pain ceases and it heals.
And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use cautery with these medicines, except in cases of evacuation of the body.
But Hippocrates says that when the sciatic vein is cut with a goat's horn, it benefits greatly; and the cautery should be done in this way: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and in the heel.
And then take a dry goat's horn and heat it over the fire until it turns to charcoal, and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is completely consumed. And then repeat this process, do not stop until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called "cautery of cows."

Chapter on Cauterization for Back Pain.
Sometimes pain in the back is caused by various factors, such as injury or impact, excessive evacuation, and other similar causes, due to the infusion of wet and cold matter.
And cautery is only effective in this one type of case, which is caused by the effusion of wet and cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with purged pills or similar remedies, which are applied to the back in the area where the pain is, making three lines according to its breadth, and then cauterize the area using signs made by a probe on each line, depending on the patient's tolerance and the potency of the remedy.
And make the cautery with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, you can cauterize with three or four cauteries using a middle-sized nail-shaped cautery in this way:

Chapter on Cauterization at the Onset of Hives.
This illness often affects small children, and the sign of its onset in children is that it occurs during erections and causes swelling and movement. [![](img/placeholder.png)]{: style="text-align:center;"}
And you will find it in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes that begin to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery in the following way:[![](img/placeholder.png)]{: style="text-align:center;"} which covers the entire area of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, you can also use a pointed cautery to make two or three lines along the circumference of the vertebra. And let the points be close together.
And then cure that area until it is healed with what has been described.
But be careful not to use cautery for hives caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter 44.
Chapter on Cauterization for Gout and Joint Pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when gout caused by cold humors is cured with treatment and the pain does not persist, then use cautery to treat any remaining pain.
And you should cauterize that area with several cauteries along the circumference of the joint in the foot. [![](img/placeholder.png)]{: style="text-align:center;"}
And the shape of an olive-shaped cautery is as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain rises into the toes or other joints and this happens frequently, then cauterize each toe with three or four cauteries on all sides using an olive-shaped cautery.[![](img/placeholder.png)]{: style="text-align:center;"}
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area but do not press too hard with the cautery beforehand, just so it is about the size of a hazelnut.
And if the pain rises into the toe and the back, then administer the cauteries as described in that chapter.
And if the pain is only in the fingers and it is called sugar, then prick along the circumference of the joints as they bend, making two lines. [![](img/placeholder.png)]{: style="text-align:center;"}
And if pain remains in the aforementioned (joints), then prick in the vicinity of the joints on every knuckle and on the fingertip of the hand.
And if pain persists for several days in the calves or muscles, then cauterize each of them from all sides with assistance.
And do not evacuate the patient through proper diet and medication, because if it is done with good care and heat is evacuated with this cautery, God willing, they will be healed.
Chapter 45.
On the Cautery of Fractures.
When a fracture occurs in the groins and intestines protrude before the genital area, and it begins to heal, then it is necessary for you to order the patient to abstain from food on that day and to use mild laxatives so that the wound of their belly heals.
And then place the patient between your hands on their back, and command them to keep their belly in so that neither the hernia nor the intestines protrude.
And then return the patient to their previous position with your hands, and press on the aforementioned area with your fingers, feeling for the fracture on the bone of the pelvis, using as a sign the tip of which should resemble the diameter of a circle at the upper parts of the body.
And then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
until it becomes very hot and emits sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestines from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then place the cautery on that sign with your hand, holding the cautery straight up and down, and push it in until you feel the bone of the pelvis in the middle of the wound; and repeat this process again if you have not succeeded in reaching the bone on the first try.
And carefully observe the symptoms of the intestines during your cauterization process, so that you do not burn the intestine and cause death or great harm to the patient.
And know that when you cannot feel the bone with the cautery, then your operation is not successful.
And it is necessary for the cautery used on children to be fine according to their size and age.
And then care for the area of the cauterization for three days until the scar from the fire has healed.
And then care for that and other wounds until they have healed.
And let the patient lie on their back for 40 days until the wound and injury are sealed.
And it is necessary to regulate the patient's nutrition according to the length of time of their healing process, which will flatten their belly and prevent the intestines from protruding due to the effort of healing.
And then when they want to get up after 40 days, then gradually and appropriately provide them with food, and continue this for another 40 days.
And let there be a reduction in work and overeating and drinking, and loud voices, because if they follow this entire healing regimen, they will be healed.
And I say the healing of fractures in other parts of the belly, and at the beginning, it is necessary for them not to stop, then cauterize the fracture with a round cautery according to its size, and let what comes out of the colon be like one-third of it; and then care for it as we have said, and do not do anything else.
And I already mentioned earlier that fractures should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, because it is marked by feeling for the bone.
And the line is placed horizontally at the width of the hand above the fracture, and another line above it; and then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the Cautery of Twisting.
When pain occurs in certain limbs due to chance or injury and persists for a long time without responding to treatment with medication, then it is necessary to use a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery for each limb be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and pain in it.
Therefore, if they are healed by the first cautery, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; because it is usual for these pains to be pricked in one limb near another, so it is necessary to reach those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the Cautery of Leprosy.
Some lepers are treated with cautery for great benefit, and moderately if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of heat and black bile.
And so when you want to cauterize the leprosy, consider if it is widespread and treat it as we have said in the division, and do not delay, but rather act quickly, and be careful not to harm the patient by allowing the corruption to spread throughout their body and entire constitution. Then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the crown, another further down above the eyebrows, two on the temples, and one at the back, either on the nape or near the ear.
And finish your hand with the cautery a little before it presses into the bone and leaves a small impression, so that the exhalation of thick vapors from it is relieved. And cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is visible, then it is necessary that you cauterize them with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head; and one over the tip of the nose, and two over the two nostrils, and two over the two vertebrae of the neck, and five over the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the vertebrae near the tailbone, and one over each rib cage, and two over the hips, and one on each hip bone, and two over the knees, and one on each knee bone, and two over the elbows, and one on each elbow bone, and two over the shoulders, and two over the muscles, and two on the tendons of their feet; and cauterize it over all the joints of the fingers and toes, the heel bones of their feet, and the knuckles of their hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are above the heel bone.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize with one cautery on the bone of the pelvis, and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another over the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the greater the benefit and relief it provides; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery as they do in their wounds, because their body is already numb from the cautery.
And it is necessary for the cauteries to be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as determined by the type of iron tools used.
And then care for the cauterization with cooked flour and honey and other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the Cautery of Stupor.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has not been healed by medicines, oils, and plasters, then you should cauterize the numb member with cauteries according to its size or smallness.
And let your cautery enter a little into the opening of the colon. And then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes stupor is cauterized in cases where it has occurred in the hands and feet, and in the vertebrae of the back, and near the eyesight of nerves that govern that member, and the stupor remains.
But do not presume to do this without knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and the exit points of all the nerves that move the entire body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of elbows, which is morphea.
When the elbow is old and does not respond to any medical ointments, then cauterize it with a pointed cautery, applying only a little pressure according to the size of the lesion until the whiteness and color have faded and the color has changed.
And cure it with a mixture of barley flour and lentil flour with rose oil and leaves of mallow, and colombine or ermine blood, using equal parts of each and mixing them together, then apply a bandage to the area and leave it on until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of the cauterization of a cancerous growth or tumor.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery along the edge of it, following its contour.
And the wise men said that it should be cauterized with a blunt-ended cautery in the middle of it; but I have not seen that done, because I fear that it may become ulcerated, and I have indeed seen that happen many times.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize it along the edge with a circular cautery, as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.
Chapter 51.
Of the cauterization of abscesses.
When an abscess is slow to mature, and this is due to excess pus or the patient's weak condition, old age, or poor blood flow, and you wish to hasten its maturation; then cauterize along the edge of it with many small pointed cauteries, and leave it alone until it matures.
But if you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then heat up the cautery until it is red-hot and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates through the flesh.
And if the cautery is applied in the area below the abscess, to relieve pressure on the arm; and then cure it once it has healed.
Chapter 52.
Of the cauterization of corroding ulcers.
A corroding ulcer is a wandering corruption in the member, which consumes it just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see a corroding ulcer in a location that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat up multiple small and large cauteries, as appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
And then cauterize all around it until you have eradicated all of the corruption, leaving no remaining cause for it.
And then leave it alone for three days and apply an oil mixture to the cauterized areas, gently rubbing it in until all of the scabs have been eradicated and all of the corruption has healed.
And then cure it with meat-generating ointments.
But if, after three days, you see that the flesh is healthy and free from corruption, then that's good; but if not, then reapply the cautery to the areas of remaining corruption.
And a corroding ulcer is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, because that serves as a substitute for cautery. But still, cautery with fire is of lighter help.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the division (or separation), and so take that when you see fit.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of boils and similar things.
Many times the parts below the sick person's foot are affected by a disease called "clau," which is a large, open wound on the side of the foot; and cauterization is performed in two ways for these, namely with fire and with hot water.
The cautionary with fire is that you heat the concave cautery, similar to aulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size that contains the nail completely, and have sharp edges.
And then place that fire (cautery) on the nail, and then rotate your hand with the cautery along the circumference of the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail. And leave it for three days until pus begins to form. And then apply a plaster made of crushed mallows boiled with salt, and leave it on for one night, because this will draw out the root of the splinter.
And then cure the wound with generative animal fat until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and there are many blisters on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water. This involves taking a small piece of iron or steel or a vulture's beak and placing it on the nail. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cup of the cautery and hold it there with compression from your hand, pressing the edge of the cup against the root of the nail, allowing the hot water to find its way along the path of the root of the nail. Have the patient endure the burning sensation of the hot water for an hour, then remove the cautery as the nail and its roots will have been drawn out.
And do the same with the others until they are all healed.
And then cure the pus that has formed from the roots of the nails with fattened animal fat.
Chapter III.
On the Cautery for Tremors.
When you are treating a tremor caused by cold in the nerves or fever from any cause or similar causes, then it is necessary to cauterize with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a pointed cautery on the feet, and above the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery.
And the tremor of the patient will subside and hasten the healing of the illness.
Chapter LV.
On the Cautery for White Spots on the Body.
When white spots appear on the body and are accompanied by pustules or fissures filled with thick corrupted matter, it is necessary at first to cauterize the top of the fistula with a thin pointed cautery made from myrtle wood, with its tip extended by fire; or with a long surgical needle; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize next to the beginning of its expulsion in this way, and they are not believed (?), and the excess matter is discharged from them, and they heal.
However, it is necessary that this be done with evacuation by bloodletting.
Chapter LVI.
On the Cautery for Flexion of Blood Vessels through Incision of Arteries.
Often, when there is flexion of arteries that has been incised on the outside of a wound or an abscess or cauterization of a limb, it is difficult to heal this.
Whenever this happens, then you must place your hand over the orifice of the artery and apply your finger to it firmly, so that many times you can stop the flow of blood from the wound and prevent it from coming out again.
And then place the olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, several and large ones, many times, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of them, either small or large, depending on the location and the wound where the artery is ruptured, place it firmly over the vein that you have identified, and leave it in place until it has burned through and stopped the flow of blood.
And if the blood continues to flow from the opening of the artery when you remove the cautery and it has burned through, then take another cautery that has been prepared in the fire and repeat the process until the bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are nearby, and prevent any other injury from occurring to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in these cases except by one of four methods: with cautery as previously described, or through extraction if it has not been extracted already, because when it is extracted the extremities are better burned and the bleeding stops; or by tying it with thread or ligament for strong constriction, or by placing medicines on it that have the power to constrict blood vessels, and applying a cushion with appropriate pressure.
However, those who administer constriction with thread or cloth or by means of burning causes or similar methods should be careful and not act hastily.
However, if this happens and the doctor is not present or no medicine is available, then place your index finger firmly over the opening of the vein as previously described, and continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops and the wound above the artery has begun to close. Then sprinkle cold water on the area around the artery until the blood coagulates and thickens. And consider what cautery or medicine is necessary in this situation.
On Incisions, Perforations, Cupping, Bloodletting, Wounds and their Similarities.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses where cautery with fire is appropriate and the occasions and causes of these, as well as the necessary instruments and forms of cauteries. And we have organized the chapters from the top of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the reader may find what they are looking for, and then address any questions they may have.
Before I begin, my son, it is important for you to understand that in this chapter we will be discussing those things that were discussed in the first chapter on cautery, but now from a surgical perspective.
And so it is essential to exercise great caution in the operations described in this chapter, as many of them involve evacuation through blood loss, which can be life-threatening if not performed correctly, such as venesection, incision on an abscess or wound, purging of a wound, extraction of an arrowhead, incision of a stone and similar procedures. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the most serious cases, death.
I warn you to be cautious and not hesitate in these matters, for sometimes the way in which you must act is different for a patient with a serious illness than it would be for a healthy person. And some patients are so ill that they may react poorly to treatment and even die, not because of the procedure itself, but due to the severity of their illness, the length of time they have been sick, or simply out of fear of death.
And there are those who will offer you payment and ask for your help, hoping to be cured, but their illness is so severe that it cannot be treated.
And so it is not advisable to accept such cases, and your caution should be greater than your desire for payment, and you should never presume to know more than you do, but rather rely on proven knowledge and sound judgment.
And use prognosis and diagnosis in the treatment of all your patients, as this will not only help you to determine the best course of action for their recovery, but it will also bring you fame and a good reputation.
Oh, my son, may God inspire you with wisdom and guide and protect you, for this is in His hands.
I have organized this chapter into sections according to the topics covered in the chapter on cautery, so that you may easily find what you are looking for and address any questions or concerns you may have.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of water (edema) that is contained in the head of infants.
Know that this illness often occurs in infants shortly after birth, and it usually happens when the wet nurse lifts the infant's head.
And sometimes, it occurs due to hidden causes that are not known.
But I have not seen this illness except in infants; and in all those whom I have seen, it has always been associated with impending death, and thus I have left them alone.
And I have seen that an infant whose head was filled with water had a constantly swollen head until it could no longer support its own weight due to the size of its head, and even as the fluid increased further, it eventually led to death.
And this fluid either accumulates between the skin and the skull or collects beneath the scalp.
Therefore, in cases where the fluid is between the skin and the skull and there is little abscess, it is necessary to make an incision on the side of the head with a fissure that is two fingers wide. The length of the fissure should be sufficient for the fluid to drain over the course of two nights. Here is the method for performing the operation:
And so if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are here two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is below the bone, a sign of this is that you see the edges of the wound open on all sides and water comes out when you press it with your finger from the inside parts, and this is not hidden. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the wound with three incisions in this manner:
and clean out the incision entirely of all moisture; and strengthen the incisions with bandages and soft sponges; and apply something from above with wine and oil inside for five days; and loosen the ligament and cure the wound with lotions and ointments, and close the wound with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And this is another method of incision, which takes into account the size of the abscess and the collection of water, for sometimes it is greater in the occipital region, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and so make the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water is visible, and do this as best you can according to your ability.
And observe that you do not incise the artery and if blood flows from it, the patient will die from this flow of blood with the evacuation of moisture.
Chapter three.
When there occurs some catarrh or wound in the ears or in the chest, and it is old and not improved by medication, then the last cure for this is the incision of those two arteries.
And so when you want to make an incision in those that shake their head (epileptics), and first rub the area with rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and consider which pulse beats in each location; and the areas of each temple close to the ears are depressed, and they are hidden except in some people.
And make a sign on the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with the blade's edge of each side sharp with an incision reaching to the bone, and this should be according to the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the blade under the artery and break it at the point where it divides above.
And let the length of the incision be two finger widths adjusted, because when any vein is incised, blood comes out with a pulsating exit, which jumps outside frequently.
But if the artery does not appear in the depression, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the length of three fingers, and make a sign with a probe, and do this reaching to the bone.
And what is necessary to throw away of the blood is a quantity of wine one ounce. And let not more or less be thrown away from it, and all this is according to the quantity which appears of the strength of the patient and of the collection of blood in the artery of him.
And make sure to consider the wound, and so if there remains on the bone any pus residue, then incise that so that a cautious abscess does not occur.
And strengthen the wound with sponges and bandages of cloth, and cure it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter four. [It appears that this translation project is about a medieval medical treatise on surgery, specifically dealing with incisions of various kinds, including the temples, arteries in the head, and wound care. The text provides detailed instructions for surgeons, including specific measurements and techniques for making incisions, as well as advice on how to handle complications such as bleeding or infection. It also emphasizes the importance of carefully considering each patient's individual condition before proceeding with treatment.]
Chapter three: On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When there occurs an old migraine or sharp catarrh in the temples due to moisture and qualities in the muscles of the temples, or a hard swelling similar to those, and it has been treated with various methods of medical care but not improved, then we have resorted to this incision of the arteries in the temples or cauterization of them as we have shown. [Continuing on with the translation:
And the method of this operation and extraction of those is that the patient shakes their head (epileptics), and you understand the artery by its pulse which appears in the temple, and it is hidden except in a few people due to the intensity of the friction.
And if it is hidden, then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and rub the area with a rough cloth or apply warm water to the area until the artery appears clearly. And then you take the scalpel of which this is the shape: And then you scrape the skin with ease until you reach the artery; and throw some there and extract it upwards towards the upper parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the membranes that are below it, completely on all sides.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of your finger and make an incision in one part according to the quantity by which its ends are extended and contracted, and there will not be a flow of blood, because if they are not incised, the blood will not flow completely.
And then evacuate the blood with one ounce of wine. I apologize for the confusion in my previous message. It seems that you have provided a continuation of the text after "e cauteriza la arceria entro que sia fermada per tota partida." Here is my translation of the rest of the passage:
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with double-strength waxed thread or long cords, and do not allow it to become putrefied before the wound is consolidated and there is no flow of blood.
And then incise the excess tissue that is between two ligaments, and do this either at that moment or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that area with a scalpel-like cautery on the bone, until its ends are incised, and it will remain in place as if it were an operation with a probe.
And it is better for the patient to have a fever or be of a heated complexion; for cautery is one of those remedies that help against harmful humors, and thus it is better in helping to heal.
It is necessary to extract the veins that are swollen in the affected area and place pads made of ground-up dry ingredients over it, then treat the wound with drying medicines and cauterize it until the flesh grows back and the wound heals completely.
And if while operating, bleeding from the vein occurs, immediately apply pressure to stop the bleeding, either by using a cautery or by filling the wound with ground-up dry ingredients, and clench your hand tightly until the bleeding stops completely. And if for any reason none of those options are available to you, place your finger over the wound until the bleeding clots, rinse the area with water that is extremely hot, just short of boiling, until the swelling subsides, and apply pressure as needed.
A lighter method of vein extraction is to use a cautery with two blades, after marking the two points on the vein with an awl, then placing each blade separately and lighting them until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, thus stretching what is between the ends of it as it has not been completely solidified by this cauterization.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the sharpness of the two blades is less than that of two knives, it is better, for if they are as sharp as two knives, they may cut too close to each vein and not cauterize the flesh properly.
Therefore, if there is some thickness to them (the blades), maintain the heat of the fire in them and cauterize the flesh lightly.
And this method is the best and lightest in all cases.
And let the space between the two blades be equal to the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
Chapter Four:
When the pain is sharp and caused by swollen veins on the heel, and no treatment has brought relief, and the patient's face becomes red and they feel as if ants are crawling on their forehead, and their heels become weakened, swollen, and the skin wrinkled, and their eyelids are scratched by the sharpness of the tears, ancient medical texts recommend this operation to treat such pain, which they call "spassa".
And the instruction is for the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead and then make three equally spaced incisions on their forehead according to its length. And if the length of the incision is two fingers: let the first incision be in the middle of the forehead, equidistant to the nose, and the second should be slightly shorter than the length of the eyelashes, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the veins that are in two places (on the forehead), and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And let the space between each incision be three fingers wide.
And if you have a sponge or dry cloths ready, use them to absorb the blood.
And then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, and this is the shape of its incision: which goes from the temple to the second incision. Scrape with that (spatula) all the skin that is between two incisions, using the tip of it that is above the bone, and then do this in the middle incision between the first and second one. And then straighten the spatula and insert into the first incision again with another tool called a "cutellar", sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that (cutellar) against the attached flesh of the skin, and the blunt edge against the bone, and insert it in such a way that it reaches the middle incision, and use it to cut all the veins that descend from the head to the heels.
But let the incision continue to the edge of the skin, and do this in the middle incision between the other two.
And when enough blood has flowed (from the incisions), squeeze the areas around the clotted blood to express it.
And then place in each incision a piece of old cotton, and put on top of it powder mixed with wine and oil and vinegar, and make sure that they do not become infected or suppurate.
And on the third day, remove the stitches and administer an infusion of hot water or chamomile, and treat it with basilicon ointment mixed with rose oil and other ingredients to heal the wounds.
Chapter Five.
Chapter Five:
When sharp and continuous pains in the veins occur, and sometimes the patient's heels become weakened, thin, and their gaze is hazy, their eyelids are ulcerated and their eyelashes fall out, and there is a throbbing pain and heaviness in the forehead, then you should know that the humors and pains come from many veins inside the head.
And the best treatment for these symptoms is as follows: command the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of it, one finger wide (starting from the left temple and ending at the right temple, going through the bone), keeping your hand away from the muscles used in chewing.
Absorb all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and place cotton or dry cloth between the two lips of the incision. And then strengthen it with powder mixed with wine and oil, to prevent infection.
And when you remove the stitches and see that the infection has decreased, then it is necessary to scrub the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and treat it with a drying regimen that promotes tissue growth, such as mixing equal parts wheat flour and colophony, making a plaster, and applying it to the wounds where new flesh is growing.
Chapter Six.
Chapter Six:
The cause of all ear infections is one of four types: either it is mineral stone or similar to stone, such as iron and glass, or it is plant-based, such as cheese or beans, or it is fluid-like, such as water, vinegar, and their like, or it is caused by an animal.
And so when stone or other similar causes of ear infections that do not fit or grow in the ear occur, place the ear in the sun, and if you see a stone, then distill it with some oil of violets or cedar, and then extract it with instruments, making the patient sneeze while holding their nostrils closed. And then place some cloth or wool patches around the outer ear, and gently pull the ear upwards to open the ear canal, for many times these causes are overlooked.
And if not, then perform an extraction with the instrument called an "epicicario subtil" of which this is the form: (the rest of the sentence seems to be describing the instrument, but it's not a complete sentence in English, so I'm just translating the first part)
And if it is pierced with an "epicicario", that's good; but if not, then perform an extraction with a small "oncia" (a unit of weight) of double refinement.
And so, if it is not pierced by that, then make a cannula of iron and insert the end of the cannula into the wound of the ear, and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that nothing comes out but the cannula. And then extract with strong suction, because many times such things happen as we have mentioned. (I'm assuming "le tieu vent" refers to the suction; it's not a term I'm familiar with)
But if it is not pierced in this way, then take a hollow probe or other suitable instrument with which you can press the wings slightly, and place it on the end of the ray, and then wrap it properly with a dressing. (I'm assuming "halka alumbat" means "hollow probe" and "vecz aparelhat" means "other suitable instrument") Then insert it into the wound of the ear with ease, and then clean the ear of moisture.
And so, if it is not pierced by any of the causes we have mentioned, then you should consider cutting it before it becomes an abscess or spasm.
And the method of cutting it is as follows: first, you should anesthetize the patient by cutting the safeneous vein and extracting blood according to the nature of the patient, then place your hand between the patient's hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision in the root of the ear where you will insert the instrument in a well-compressed location. (I'm assuming "comensament sancnes le malaute de la vena sephasica" means "anesthetize the patient by cutting the safeneous vein") And let the incision be crescent-shaped and reach the bone, and when the bone is visible, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision quickly, and care for it until it heals. (I'm assuming "figura lunar" means "crescent-shaped")
And if the cause of the abscess in the ear is an inflamed and swollen fatty tissue, then perform the cure and extraction; but if it does not obey your incision, then take fresh spittle, refined according to this form: (I'm assuming "ad eyssiment" means "incision") and use that spittle to make an incision in the fatty tissue that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this if you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, but instead place it on a piece of cloth and extract it with small weights or subtle instruments, or make an incision as previously described, for this will make the extraction easier.
But in the case of water that has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing with caution at first, and then fill the ear with some old cloth and place it over the affected ear where the water is, and if it is pierced, that's good; but if not, then take many small pieces of linen and heat them in the fire slightly, and the patient should insert one of these into the wound of their ear and jump on the same side as the affected ear and strike the piece of wood with another piece of wood on the piece of wood that is inside the ear. (I'm assuming "sternutacio" means "sneezing" and "condizi" means "with caution") And do not stop using the piece of wood until all the water has been drained. (I'm assuming "Donc" means "and", "no cesse" means "do not stop", and "peyra entro" means "using the piece of wood")
And do not stop using the piece of wood until all the water has been drained. (I'm assuming "Donc" means "and", "no cesse" means "do not stop", and "peyra entro" means "using the piece of wood") And when the water has drained away, take some paper or cloth (I'm assuming "enayssi" means "so that" and "sira foro-getada" means "has drained away") and place one end of it in the ear and stretch out the other end with fire until most of it is burned. (I'm assuming "met la una extremetat" means "place one end" and "entro que sia comburit le may de lu" means "until most of it is burned") [Note: This translation is intended to provide a general understanding of the text, but it should not be used for medical purposes. The text appears to contain instructions for various medical procedures, including the use of surgical instruments and cauterization, but it is not clear from the provided context what specific condition or conditions these procedures are meant to treat.

And then place another piece of cloth and do this many times until all the water has been drained, and then use a cannula as described above for the wooden extractor. (I'm assuming "met i autre gonc" means "place another piece of cloth")
But in the case of an animal entering the ear and having a small body, similar to a tick or other such creature, cure it as described above in the division; but if it has a larger body and causes pain in the movement, then perform the extraction using instruments and forceps, and the cause of this is lighter than all other causes that can occur in the ear. (I'm assuming "bestia intrant" means "an animal entering" and "divisio" refers to an earlier section of the text where a similar situation is discussed)
But in the case of extracting a worm born in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and not confereys, then it is necessary for you to look at the ear in the sun. (I'm assuming "verm engendrat" means "a worm born" and "distillacios e no comfereys" refers to an earlier section of the text where similar procedures are discussed) [Note: The translation provided above is intended to give a general understanding of the text, but it should not be used for medical purposes.

And so, if any cause of the worms appears here, then extract it with forceps or fine needles; but if no cause is visible, then take a cannula that is narrow at the tip and wide at the base, of which this is the form: (I'm assuming "causa dels verms" means "cause of the worms") And insert the fine tip into the ear according to the amount that the patient can bear; and then use suction with it repeatedly until all the worms have been extracted. (I'm assuming "entromet" means "insert", "succio fort" means "strong suction", and "fay aquo motas veguadas" means "do this repeatedly") [Note: The translation provided above is intended to give a general understanding of the text, but it should not be used for medical purposes.

Therefore, it is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any medical concerns or questions.]
But if it does not obey your incision, then you should fill and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which have already been proven by the ancients in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations. (I'm assuming "opila e claus" means "fill and close", "ayssi cum havem dit" means "as we have said", "obezeysso a tu al ayssiment" means "it obeys your incision", "distillacios" means "distillations", and "antics" means "the ancients")
And let your effusion be the one by which you pour medical oils into the ear with this instrument of which this is the form: (I'm assuming "tua efusio" means "your effusion", "efundas" means "pour", and "olis medicinas" means "medical oils")[Note: The translation provided above is intended to give a general understanding of the text, but it should not be used for medical purposes. The text appears to contain instructions for various medical procedures, including the use of surgical instruments and cauterization, but it is not clear from the provided context what specific condition or conditions these procedures are meant to treat.

(I'm assuming "argent" means "silver", "eram" means "iron", "desus" means "on top", and "pla" means "flat")
And so it should be like a stopper that fits in the concavity of the cannula to hold what is necessary here. (I'm assuming "empellent" means "stopper", "conquavitat" means "concavity", and "de continent" means "to hold")[Note: The translation provided above is intended to give a general understanding of the text, but it should not be used for medical purposes.

Chapter 7
On the treatment of an earwax blockage.
Sometimes earwax blockages occur in infants in the wombs of their mothers, and this can also happen in adult men, when wax or foreign matter blocks the ear canal; and this blockage can sometimes be inside the ear canal where it is not visible, and sometimes it is outside.
And that which occurs inside the ear canal, where it is not visible, is in the majority of cases difficult to cure.
And when it is visible, it is appropriate to place the patient's ear towards the sun and look into it. And so, if you see an evident blockage, open it with a thin spatula of which this is the shape: (presumably followed by a diagram or description)
The end of it should be thin, with one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger-widths in length, so as not to harm the ear.
And so, if the blockage is caused by earwax or flesh grown in the ear canal, then use thin forceps and carefully cut through it until all the obstruction is removed.
And if the blockage is inside the ear canal, then take a thin probe and heat it slightly over fire; then insert the probe gently into the ear canal.
And so, if you have detected a blockage with the patient having difficulty hearing, then gently relieve the pressure with ease, and take care not to damage the ear's nerves.
Then place a cloth on the ear according to the size of the opening that you have cleaned and covered it with Egyptian wax; do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed. Alternatively, take some herbs and soak them in water, then grind them into a powder and apply it three times a day and use it until the infection subsides. And if you see that the ear is swollen, then it is necessary to lance it with a scalpel and replace it with another cloth covered in wax made from rose oil until the swelling goes down. Then continue treating it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Then use another treatment to stop the bleeding, which is called "distillation" in the medical treatise.
Chapter 8.
On the treatment of blepharitis, which affects the eyelids.
Blepharitis, which sometimes occurs due to moisture and in some cases is dry.
Therefore, it is necessary to have tweezers or forceps and use a spatula to open the eyelids gently; then place them in the correct position three times a day.
But if pain and bleeding occur, then use a pointed lancet to cauterize the area.
And the best method of cauterization is to make incisions and cuts in the affected area, returning when any remaining cause for concern remains. Once cauterized with fire, those edges are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment for styes that occur on the eyelids.
Often, small lumps appear on the eyelids, which are similar to styes in their strength and hardness, and for this reason they are called "grandissias."
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the eyelid, both above and below.
Therefore, the operation in their case is to consider whether the stye is protruding from the eyelid and swollen on all sides, and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it with a scalpel in width, and then cauterize it all around with ease until it dries up. After that, use forceps to lift it and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, use stitches to adjust it and continue treating it until it heals.
And if it's small, there will be no harm in leaving it untreated, as the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the stye is tilting towards the inner parts of the eyelid, then turn the eyelid inside out and use forceps to lift it, making an incision where necessary and pressing on it from all sides. If the incision on the eyelid is long, it's not a problem.
And after making the incision, wash the eye with salt water and treat the area with ointment until it heals completely.
Chapter 10.
Treatment of chalazion on the upper eyelid.
Chalazion is a swelling that forms in the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid and mainly affects children, causing eye redness and thickening of the eyelids, preventing them from opening their eyes wide and causing tearing. [
And so you see them always touching their faces, and they sleep on their faces; and if the eyelashes of their lower eyelids are damp, there is already an inflammation present, and a clear sign of impending infection is visible in the eye. Moreover, when you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the infection spreading.
One method of treatment for this condition is when the patient places their head on your lap, and you place a cloth over them to keep warm. Then, create a circle with a circumference that matches the size of the affected area using clay or similar material. Place this circle on top of the chalazion and press gently with your fingers, allowing pus to collect in the center of the circle. Next, make an incision in the center of the inflammation using a spatula and cut it open widthwise, ensuring that the incision is not larger than the one made during bloodletting.
However, in cases where the chalazion is located deep inside the eyelid, it's necessary to make a larger incision all the way down to reach the pus. This is because in severe cases, the pus may be located deep within the tissue and cannot be accessed through a small incision. The author advises making an incision similar to that of a white ulcer, which would allow for proper drainage and healing.
Therefore, remove the pus using cloths that you have wrapped around your fingers and place them on the outer parts of the eyelid. Then, rub your hands together gently to disperse the pus and clean the area. The text emphasizes the importance of a gentle touch when treating chalazions to prevent any further harm to the eye.
And be careful not to touch the incision with the spatula, in order to avoid damaging the eye. The author emphasizes the importance of being cautious and gentle when treating chalazions to prevent any further harm to the eye.
However, if pus is not visible at the beginning of the incision, then make a small incision with ease until you see pus appearing. Then remove the pus as previously described, and rinse the area with water and vinegar, placing clean cloths over it and securing them with bandages.
And in cases where three times the amount of salt is applied and it remains inside the incision, this means that there is still some remaining moisture in the affected area. The author advises using a spatula to remove any remaining pus or debris from the incision before applying more salt. This process may need to be repeated several times until all the moisture has been removed.
And after that, continue to care for it until it heals completely. The text emphasizes the importance of ongoing care and monitoring when treating chalazions to ensure proper healing and prevent any further complications. By following these guidelines, medical practitioners can help their patients recover from this condition and maintain good eye health.
However, if an abscess forms in the affected area, then treat it with a healing plaster until it heals completely. The text advises medical practitioners to be vigilant for signs of infection when treating chalazions and take appropriate action to prevent any further complications. By following these guidelines, they can promote proper healing and ensure good eye health.

Chapter 11: On methods of touching (or examining) the eye.
When there are natural eyelashes on the lower eyelids that have become ingrown and are old, these cause problems for the eye and lead to various ailments such as constant tearing, swelling of the eyelid, and thickening of the conjunctiva. This condition is called "tactinir del huel," and it can be treated in four ways: by cauterization with fire; using acute medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; through incision and stitches; or using rods as I will explain later.
And so it is necessary to place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the affected eye upwards using your left hand. If successful, proceed to the next step. If not, insert a needle with thread dipped in pus below the eyelid, and push it upwards towards the edge of the eyelid near the lashes. Then gently pull on the thread while turning the eyelid upwards using your right hand.
And then make an incision in the inner part of the lower eyelid using a lacrimal spatula to release the ingrown lashes, and remove the pus from under the eyelid. Then place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid and cover it with a bandage shaped like a myrtle leaf.
However, it is important that the incision should be made according to the degree of swelling of the eyelid, since this varies among individuals, as there are some who require a significant amount of fluid to be drained based on the degree to which the eyelid has softened.
And then apply a probe along the two lines that you have marked, starting from the outer canthus (lacrimal major) and moving towards the inner canthus (lacrimal menor). And if the incision is near the natural eyelashes, make it as thick as a royal coin (grossetut del rey).
And then insert a probe into one of the two corners of the eye and make an incision along its entire length. Then align the two eyelids with a thin piece of wool or ligature, wiping away any blood that may result. If you wish to do so, apply some styptic to the area above the eyebrows to stop any excess fluid from draining out. Otherwise, do not worry about it.
And then leave the suture of the incision in place for three to four days and take care of it.
And if you prefer, remove the stitches after the incision has healed and care for it with a drying and constricting agent, as the eyelid will be swollen due to the seal of the incision and the addition of fluid. However, leaving the stitches in place is generally better. Therefore, I say this only for those who prefer to remove them.
However, if the patient feels discomfort or pain, it is important to address their concerns and provide comfort, not out of fear but as part of good medical practice.
There is another method of making an incision on the eyelid. It involves marking a shape similar to a myrtle leaf on the eyelid and then raising the eyelid with three separate and connected probes in this shape.
However, if that is not possible, use probes instead and insert the needle with thread in the center of the marked shape. Then place one probe near the outer canthus (lacrimal major) and another near the inner canthus (lacrimal menor), aligning them evenly between the two. Finally, raise the eyelid using these probes while applying equal pressure.
And then align the edges of the incision with stitches and care for it until it has healed.
However, if an abscess forms near the incision or probe mark, treat it with a mixture of wax and similar substances, as well as ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes of some patients may turn inward. In this case, it is recommended to use the incision method described earlier. However, using stitches would be more artificial in these cases.
To perform cauterization with a hot iron rod (ataxinir am cannas) is done in this way: The procedure involves bending the eyelid and making an incision along the marked shape, as previously described. Then, create two thin iron rods or sticks that are as long as the eyelid and narrower than the probe used earlier. And you have already made incisions at the ends of each partitioned section, where the stitches are located.
Then carefully add a small amount of the fluid from the eyelid to each partitioned section and constrict the iron rods tightly, leaving them in place for several days. The swelling will subside and the eyelid will heal on its own over time.
However, if it takes too long for the swelling to subside and the eyelid to heal, then remove the iron rods carefully by breaking the seal with tweezers and continue caring for the incision until it has healed.
And once it is healed, the eyelid will remain raised and the lashes will not poke or irritate the eye.
And this is the method for creating two iron rods in this way: and make sure that the length and width are neither too large nor too small.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12: Raising the eyelid and removing irritating lashes with a needle when the lashes are hard or stiff.
When the eyelashes are not natural and are hard, rough, and poke or irritate the eye, the procedure involves using a thin needle dipped in a mixture of wax, crushed cedar, and lion fat. Then, carefully align and secure each eyelash with subtle precision. And make sure the length of the mixture-coated thread is about a palm's length.
Then, prepare another thin mixture and apply it to the other end of the thread if desired.
Then, position the patient's head so that they are facing towards you and in a well-lit area, as this procedure requires precision and attention to detail.
Then, insert the needle into the base of the eyelash, carefully adjusting its position until it is securely in place. Quickly push the needle through the eyelid and pull it out above the natural eyelash.
Then, carefully pull the eyelash above the needle and insert it into the incision in the eyelid. Make sure to only remove one, two, or three lashes at a time.
Then, gently pull the thread with your hand until the eyelash is completely removed from the eyelid, using the natural eyelashes as a guide to ensure proper placement of the new lashes.
However, if the eyelash does not come out easily and instead remains attached to the eyelid, gently pull on the thread until it is detached from the incision in the eyelid. Continue pulling until the eyelash is completely removed.
And check the eye regularly to ensure that the thread and mixture are no longer present in the eyelid. If the eyelash has not yet healed or adhered to its proper location, leave the stitches in place for two to three days until it does.
And if the eyelash is shorter than the natural lashes, attach an artificial eyelash that matches their length and use it to raise the short lash or allow it to grow naturally until it reaches the desired length. Then, carefully raise the eyelash using the artificial one.
Chapter 13.
Chapter 13: Treating ectropion, a condition where the eyelid turns outward.
When the eyelid turns outward and contracts above or to the left or right side due to poor healing of an incision, section, or cauterization, this condition is called leporina (ectropion). It can be either natural or accidental, caused by improper healing of wounds or burns.
The procedure for treating this condition involves cutting open the scar tissue and separating the eyelid edges. Place a piece of linen cloth between them and secure it in place until healed.
It is important not to use any drying or constricting treatments on the eyelid during healing, as this may worsen the ectropion and make it more difficult to treat.
Instead, use moisturizing treatments such as fenugreek, which can soften the eyelid tissue. Soak althea root and seeds in water, or use a liquid eye ointment made with one of the oils. Submerge the linen cloth in this mixture and use it to care for the eyelid.
The key to successful treatment is to carefully and thoroughly break up any scar tissue or contracted areas using all available skill and care, just as was done at the beginning of the procedure.
The procedure described here is simply a method for correcting ectropion (alhacratir), although it may not fully restore the eyelid to its original shape or form.
Chapter 14.
Chapter 14: Treating entropion, a condition where the eyelid turns inward.
This inflammation that occurs on the lower eyelid is truly called alxicraci; and it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental [alxicraci] is caused by infection, cut, burn or similar factors.
And the method of the operation is to take a needle with double thread, insert it into the flesh, passing from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal point, until the thread reaches both ends of the incision in the flesh.
And then pull the skin apart at the edges using the needle and stitch it together with the needle, cutting wide with a spatula. And if the shape of the eyelid returns to normal, that is good; if not, take a rod and place it in the slit, then use the rod to turn the eyelid, making two cuts at the lower edge of the lower eyelid.
And the ends of the two cuts should be at the angles of the incision made earlier, and they should converge so that when they meet a shape is formed from their meeting point.
And this shape is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove the flesh from the cut so that the eyelid becomes thinner.
Then bring the separated parts together and stitch them with wool thread, then heal it with remedies that we mentioned earlier, using gentle poultices until healed.
If the inflammation progresses to a cut or stitching or burn, then it is necessary to make an incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate with gentle poultices between two folds as we mentioned earlier.
In summary, the treatment for inflammation of the upper or lower eyelid should follow this procedure, which is based on the form of the inflammation, and that is in the shape of various spots.
And wise craftsmen always prepare various methods to make the affected area return to its natural shape or close to it, depending on what is suitable for each patient's operation and the instruments used in the most appropriate manner.

Chapter 15: On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or Cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in some men where the eyelid is attached to the white of the eye, making it difficult for movement and natural functions, then you must introduce a rod beneath the eyelid, raising it or extending it with forceps.
Then you must cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that is not sharp, having a blunt tip so as to not disturb the patient during the operation, and leave the spatula in place without touching the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should be gentle, separating the adhesion with ease until it is returned to its natural shape and all the affected area is healed.
Then you should apply salt water to the eye and rinse it, or distill juniper dissolved in water onto it.
Then you should separate the eyelid and eye with gentle poultices, placing wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and for three days after use remedies that promote adhesion until healed.
Chapter 16. [(Note: This is my guess based on the format of the previous lines, as there was no context provided)] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j\&t=0m2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j%5C&t=0m2s)
Chapter 16: On Incision of a Nail and Excessive Growth of Flesh around the Tear Ducts.
Know that there are two types of nails, one is nerve-related and looks like a hard thin substance, while the other is not nerve-related and resembles congealed white moisture. When cut with forceps, this type separates easily without being pierced by the forceps.
And both types begin at the major tear duct, gradually covering the eye and hindering vision and the natural movements of the eyelid. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z6\&t=0m2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z6%5C&t=0m2s)
But the method of operation in cutting the nail is to have the patient tilt their head back and open their eyes wide. You should lift the eyelid with your hand, grip the nail with forceps with little doubling over, and stretch it upwards. Then take a needle and insert a horsehair or cattle hair or goat hair or similar material into the tip of the needle, or dip the end of the needle in strong bile, and slowly double the tip of the needle. Insert it into the middle of the nail, then use the needle to penetrate the nail and bind it with bile, stretching it upwards. Use the hair to scrape the edge of the nail that covers the pupil. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5p\&t=0m2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5p%5C&t=0m2s) And continue scraping with the hair along the edge of the nail until its entirety has been removed.
Then you should cut the remaining piece of nail at the root with a thin spatula or small forceps and remove it to reveal the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that cutting it does not result in continuous flow of tears due to damage of the lacrimal gland.
Sometimes the nail is removed using a single stretched forceps or bile as mentioned earlier, and then it should be scraped with a sharp-pointed spatula shaped like this:
And be careful with the spatula not to touch the cornea and to avoid rupturing it, making sure that the pupil remains intact throughout the procedure.
After the incision, place a little bit of salt or crushed onion in the eye and leave it for another day. Then heal it with remedies as necessary until healed.
If the nail is not nerve-related and you cannot insert the needle or forceps, many times this type of nail can be healed with medicine. It will heal just like any other eye wound as mentioned in the previous section.
If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a thin spatula with the following shape: with subtlety. If sometimes the tear duct is obstructed and congested, you can distill your own tears or onion juice or saltwater into it with an eyecup. Keep this up for one day.
Then repeat the operation until everything in the tear duct is removed, unless a counter-abscess has formed in the eye. In that case, you should leave it alone and first heal the abscess until it is healed.
And repeat your operation with reason until it is healed.
If the growth of the flesh around the tear duct is very harmful to the eye, then use forceps to suspend it. Make an incision on one side of it and do not reach the bottom of the cut to avoid injuring the flow of tears.
Then distill onion juice or crushed onion into the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17:
Chapter 17: On Incision of Cysts and Growths in the Eyelid.
Sometimes in the eyes of old people, there is a growth of red flesh that covers or approaches the pupil and presses on the eyelids, making them partially close like a twisted baluster.
But the operation for this is to have the patient tilt their head back and open their eyes wide. Then you should use forceps or a clamp to gather all the flesh together, holding it tightly. Next, make an incision at the beginning of the growth, gradually cutting it out completely using an appropriate surgical tool. Make sure not to harm the eye during the operation.
And let your incision be the one with which you make an incision in the skin or squeeze out pus, just as we have described in the procedure of nail surgery, or with small forceps that gather pus according to the shape, as will be appropriate for this chapter.
Once your incision is complete and all the flesh is opened up, then fill the cavity with crushed salt or distill into it red-colored powder that looks like corrosive medicine, and place a piece of linen cloth dipped in egg white over the cavity until it is certain that a pustule has formed due to cauterization.
And if there is still some cause for abscess formation and bleeding from the wound persists, and you fear that it may turn into a pustule due to cauterization, then leave the cavity open and treat the pustule with what is appropriate for its treatment, and similarly, repeat this operation until the flesh of this kind heals.
However, it is important that you avoid any treatment for the wound that involves natural or accidental means using iron, and do not use your hands in any of these operations until you are sure that the affected part can withstand the operation.

Here comes the translation for "De colleccio de sabel en le huel" (Collection of pus in the wound):
Here is the translation for "Sabel so venas rogas las quals son testudas sobre le huel e prohibeysso al vesement la sua operacio, e develican le huel am longitut de dias":
Here is the translation for "Donc necessari es al comensament que tu consideres si le huel en le qual es sabel es fort e en lu no es autra malautia que sabel, lahoras tu colligeys aquel sabel":
Here is the translation for "E es que tu comandes al malaute que pause le sieu cap en le tieu se, e aprop suspen aquelas venas am un onci o am dos segon la tua prudencia; e sia aquel onci de subtil duplicacio segon aquesta forma:":
Here is the continuation of the previous sentence:
Here is the translation for "E aprop sian colligidas aquelas venas am forses subtils, am subtilitat, e abstergeys le sanc hora aprop hora, entro que vegas aquelas venas esser remaugudas del huel e sian revolgudas":
Here is the translation for "E guarda te que tu no ledes le huel am les extremitatz del spatum; e si’ la tua operacio en le miegjorn denant le solelh, e sias mot ferm en la tua operacio que no inscides sino aquelas venas":
Here is the translation for "E quan tu auras complitz, lahoras tu distilla en le huel cief vert o rog per que am sa acuitat corrodesca aquo que es remaugut del sabel":
Here is the translation for "Mays si aquo no es a tu possible colligeys tot en aquela hora, e lahoras tu emplastra tot am aquo que cede la dolor de lu, e leyssa lu per alcus dias entro que sia sedada la dolor de lu e que sia asegurat de apostema caut":
Here is the translation for "E aprop itera sobre lu segon que la mateyssa manieyra entro que sia sanat":
Here is the translation for "E aquesta es la forma de les forfexs":
Here is the translation for "Capitol .xix":
Here is the translation for "De reduccio de arizati al nas":
Here is the translation for "Quan tu curas arisati am cauteri o am medicina aguda comburent segon que es precedida la narracio de lu e no es sanat, lahoras no es engen en lu sino que fendas sobre le apostema deves la maturitat de lu, e que extraguas tota la humiditat la qual es en lu e·l poyre entro que sia descubert le os":
Here is the translation for "E donc cum es descubert le os e vezes en lu corrupcio o negror, lahoras tu ratz lu am un sturment del qual aquesta es la forma":
Here is the translation for "E es nompnat de aspre cap, e sia feyt de fer indi, e sia le cap redon ayssi cum asir le qual sia fayt punctat per puntacio de lima o aliskalfati per puntacio subtil (ayssi cum es en la forma seguent)":
And place him on the affected spot of the bone, and carefully rotate it between your said hands, and press your hand firmly until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic remedies.
Therefore, if the area becomes solid and healthy flesh has grown, and the body is separated from the pus and remains so for 40 days, without any renewed inflammation or abscess formation or other accident occurring, then you know that it has healed.
But if not, it is not enough to reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, but rather you should proceed as follows: first uncover the bone with either iron or acute medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then take clay in this shape:
Let the outer part of the tool be triangular, and the stem of it be thin at the end as many times as necessary.
Then place it on the bone, specifically near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little towards the eye, and rotate your hand with the clay until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel this as you press lightly on their eye.
Therefore, restore the area with drying and styptic remedies as has been instructed.
Therefore, when the flesh has grown back and the area has hardened, the matter that had been exuding from the wounds will be reabsorbed back into the nose, which is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
On reducing the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety without causing any significant harm or damage, then it is necessary to relax the patient, and apply gentle pressure to follow the movement of the eye, while also placing blistering agents on the neck without cutting or scarifying the skin and allowing them to draw out the excess fluid. Additionally, apply a liniment made from aloe, acacia, frankincense, and tragacanth directly onto the eye, and strengthen the poultice with powdered herbs.
The method for making the powder is to take strips of lion's fur and fold each one in four layers; then make a powder from these strips.
Then place these powders on top of each other according to the amount necessary for the eye. Then strengthen the poultice with a hard cloth and tight bandage; repeat the blistering agents with good suction without cutting or scarifying the skin; and then remove the blistering agents and leave the eye straight for one day and night.
But if during this time the ligament becomes weakened or loose, then it is necessary to apply a tighter bandage.
Then loosen the ligament during the day and night as we have said.
And if the eye has already been reduced, that is good, but if not, then continue to apply the poultice with the powders and tight bandage along with the blistering agents until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On incising the prominence of the choroid coat (uvea).
When there is a disruption or tear in the choroid coat (uvea) and it has become prominent and protruding like a raisin outside of the eyelids, giving the appearance of a human face, and you wish to make an incision, then the surgical procedure should be performed as follows: carefully insert the needle into the edge of the uvea from the lower side towards the upper side, and then insert another needle with double thread at the lacrimal point. Make sure that this second needle is able to penetrate deeply, leaving the first needle in its original position. Next, cut along the path of the double thread and use it to lift and remove the damaged section of the uvea, carefully tying off the area as you go.
Then carefully remove the needle and place some wool soaked in egg white albumen over the eye, allowing the thread to become embedded in the uvea as it heals.
Then care for the eye with remedies that promote healing and comfort until the injury has fully healed.
And repeat this process several times, adding a ring of cloth around the entire circumference of the eye to help support any prominent swelling or bulging, and then use a thin spatula to carefully make a small incision in the sclera (the white part of the eye) just above the iris. This will allow any excess fluid to drain away and reduce the pressure inside the eye, helping it to return to its normal position more quickly.
Then continue to apply supportive treatments until the injury has fully healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of cataracts (albuca).
This condition, commonly referred to as cataracts (albuca), is actually a type of pus or inflammation that has become lodged in the eye and takes on the appearance of water descending downward, but is not actually water.
But the method for treating cataracts is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, while you gently hold their head with both hands, positioning your fingers so that you can see the pus or inflammation as it moves downward. Then, carefully prevent it from descending further by holding the eyelids apart, allowing the patient to continue seeing clearly as they normally would.
And if it does not descend further downward, then you will know that it is water (fluid).
But if the pus or inflammation has not been prepared to descend on its own using the methods we have described, then position the patient's head between your hands and carefully use a thin spatula to make an incision in the conjunctiva (the transparent membrane covering the front of the eye) just above the cornea (the clear, outer layer of the eye). Make sure to place the incision in a location that is slightly away from the continuation of the conjunctiva and tunica cornea in the crown (at the edge of the iris), allowing any pus or inflammation to be expelled from the eye.
And once the pus or inflammation has been expelled from the eye, then you should instill a solution of warm water with added honey and fenugreek boiled in it into the eye.
Then continue to care for the eye with other remedies as needed until it has fully healed.
Chapter 23.
On the treatment of watery eyes (excessive tearing).
We have already discussed the different types of water (fluid) that may be present in the eye and how to identify them based on their appearance and behavior. Now, we will discuss which type requires surgical intervention and when it is appropriate to perform such a procedure.
Therefore, it is necessary to sit the patient between your hands with a small piece of cloth or gauze over their eye, and gently apply pressure to hold the eyelid open.
And place your left hand close to the patient's lower eyelid, if the watery humor is in the left eye; or use your right hand, if the humor is in the right eye.
And place your right hand on a tampon, if the humor is in the left eye; or use your left hand, if the humor is in the right eye.
And place the tip of the tampon near the crown by the thickness of the rod in the inner corner of the eye, and roll the tampon with your hand using some force.
And insert the tampon into the white of the eye and make sure that it has reached the desired location.
And the width of the tampon should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the colored part (iris), which is the crown of the eye, because you will see the pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tissue.
And insert the tampon into the location of the watery humor, and pull it down a little, then again, and if the water descends quickly, then tell the patient to look at what they have been seeing with their eye, and the tampon in their eye.
And pause for a bit; if the water has descended, then you should stop pulling before the tampon falls out.
And when it is dry and does not descend, then you should remove the tampon gently, and rinse the eye with the tampon a little at a time, and dissolve a small amount of clear gem-like salt in the water and wash the inside of the eye; and then place a bandage or stopper or wool soaked in rose oil and white of egg on the outside of the eye to keep it closed.
But those who live in our time should use a mixture of three hundred with white of egg instead.
And if the tampon does not enter the eye due to its hardness - for some men have very hard eyes - then you should take a spatula called alberit, which is made in this way:
And make a hole with it in the conjunctiva, but do not push your hand through the opening, and only make a subtle path for the tampon to enter.
And insert the tampon as we have said.
And you should complete your work by preparing a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on their back in a dark room and be forbidden from making any movements.
And let nature take its course so that the condition can be healed, and not cause any harm to the patient's head as they leave.
And the bandage should remain in place according to their disposition for up to three days.
And remove the bandage in a dark room and examine the patient's eye, show them various objects, and then replace the bandage within seven days.
And it is not necessary to do this during the hours of cure or immediately before an infusion. You must be careful because the water can easily flow out due to great and intense attention (during the examination of the eye).
But if an abscess forms, then you should remove the bandage before the seventh day and correct it with whatever is necessary for the abscess.
And now you have completed the examination of the eye and place an oral medicine on their face so that it can be absorbed through the skin for several days, while they are in a dark room.
And now gradually take them out of the darkness and have them return to their normal activities.
And know that in alchemy, the student should not refrain from looking several times, and therefore you should be bold during the operation.
And now some of those who practice the art have come to us, and some say that they make a fire in the Ayrac (?) with a perforated almagra (a type of clay or chalk) through which water passes.
But I have not seen any proof of this in our land, nor is it mentioned in any of the books of the ancients, and it is possible that this is a new development.
These are the forms of the types of almagra (a type of clay or chalk) that can be used, for those who do not know them:
They are made of earth or iron properly, and their ends are sharpened to a triangular point, with the tip being as fine as this shape. [Note: The translation is provided in English prose due to the technical nature of the text.]
Chapter 24.
Chapter 24: On the Treatment of a Nose Abscess
When flesh has grown inside the nose in various layers and becomes swollen due to some cause that resembles a scorpion with heavy stings or a polyp foot, and this condition is called polyps because it looks like the represented foot of a polyp, then you should proceed as follows: And if it is cancerous flesh, ulcerated, with a dark color, or if it has the appearance of a lion's flesh but not dark in color, then you should proceed as follows:
And in the case of lion-like flesh that is not fraudulent or cancerous, it is necessary to have the patient sit between your hands and expose their nose to the sun, and then use a probe to make small incisions in those fleshy areas. And then remove the abscess to the outside, and cut away what you have grasped with a sharp, thin spatula from one side to the other until you are certain that all of the flesh has been removed. If there is any reason why an abscess could still form, then use one of your fine instruments gently to remove any remaining cause. But if it is controlled by blood or an abscess forms, then you should do what is necessary; that is, if it is a malignant abscess, then you should cauterize it until blood is shed and all of the abscesses are removed.
And then place a piece of linen gauze soaked in vinegar or wine over the incision in the nose. But if the nose is open and there is a process of humidity extending into the palate, then you should know that it has healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that inside there is flesh growing on the upper bones of the nose where the abscess has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to make incisions in the swelling of the person, making many small incisions, and placing a small amount of space between each incision, equivalent to a finger's width or less. And then heal the patient and insert one end of the bile duct into their nose using a probe or any other means that is possible.
And once that is done, draw out the odor of the bile duct so that it reaches the nostrils and exits through the nose, for many times children in schools have similar reactions to this action, and it is an easy remedy for those who wish to do it.
Then place the two ends of the bile duct, one end exiting through the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer flesh sutures to the incisions in the bile duct until you are certain that the flesh has united with the incisions of the bile duct.
Then remove the bile duct and place it in the nose with a piece of cotton to absorb the blood, doing this for three days or more until the pus has completely dissolved all that is dead from the flesh.
And at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it has healed.
But if the healing process dries up, use this remedy.
And this is the form of the purge-making instrument with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose.
And make it from silver or lead, similar to a small lamp with an open top, shaped like a small basin, and also made of the same material.
And if you wish, make the cannula closed like a reed, and the nozzle of the purge-making instrument should be flat and open; to which there should be a handle on the back, by which you can hold it when heating oil or any other liquid in it that you want from extracts and substances.
Chapter 25.
Of tumors found at the ends of the nose.
Often a tumor is found at the ends of the nose, and it becomes swollen and noticeable in certain days within which much attention should be paid to it.
And therefore, you must incise that tumor at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it. Then place a hot compress or a burning medicine on the area where the tumor was, in its place.
But if the incision is delayed until it has become enlarged, then consider whether it is hardened, with a dark color and little feeling, in which case do not touch it with iron because it is a gangrenous abscess; for many times those who incise this type of abscess end up causing great harm to the person.
But if the abscess is of a lion's color and not dark, and it is possible to incise all of it, then operate on the patient and make the incision without fear, and heal the area with drying medicine until it has healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose and lips and ear when continuity is dissolved by plague or similar causes. [**Note: The text seems to be missing a line between "per plaga" (by plague) and "o per semblantz" (or similar causes), as it creates an incomplete sentence.**]
Know that when there is dissolution of continuity in one of these cartilage parts, little attention should be paid to the operation except in some cases. [**Note: The text mentions "aquestas cartillages" (these cartilages), but it is unclear what specific body parts are being referred to.**]
Therefore, when dealing with any cause related to one of those (cartilages), it is important to consider whether it is a fresh plague wound with blood, and if so, then you should bring the two lips of the wound together using sutures, and then heal that area until it has healed.
And if the lips of the dissolution of continuity are already separated and each one has become healthy, then it is necessary to remove a piece of the edge of its skin until blood comes out. Then bring the two lips together using sutures and hold them in place, then sprinkle dragon's blood powder on top of it and let it dry for three days, and place over the powder a plaster of diascaride or another consolidating plaster, and leave this poultice in place for two or three days. Then remove it and replace it with a new poultice and leave it until the pus has separated by itself, then heal with ointment until it is healed.
However, the method of suturing involves bringing together the dissolution of continuity with needles as we have recommended in abdominal suturing, or bring together the dissolution of continuity with bile as I have shown you.

Chapter 27: On the Extraction of Causes That Come in the Two Lips in the Inner Parts
Often, many men develop abscesses in the inner parts of their lips that are similar to goose fat and are hard. Some are smaller while others are larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to make incisions on the lips and divide each of those hardenings in half, and then perform an abscission, filling that area with trichlorinated soda until the blood coagulates, and then wash it with vinegar water and heal the area with a styptic medicine until it heals.
Chapter 28.
Chapter 28: On Incising Tight Skin on the Gums
Often, a large number of abscesses form on the gums due to tight skin, which ancient people called "albulus," and therefore it is necessary to suspend that with an ounce or hold it with forceps and make an incision in it according to its size, and then allow the pus or blood to flow out.
Then place over the area trichlorinated soda or other styptic or exsiccative powders.
And if the skin returns, then incise it again secondarily and cauterize that area, because the cautery will not return.
Chapter 29: On the Treatment of Gum Abscesses Caused by Tight Skin
Chapter 29: On Tooth Extraction with Iron Instruments
When rough and hard calluses form on the surface of the inner and outer teeth, between the gums, and they are blackened and made citrine or greenish in color, this causes corruption to the gum and makes the teeth loose.
And so it is necessary that you bleed the patient between your hands and place their head in your lap, and file down their teeth where those calluses and similar causes appear, like sand, so that no cause remains, and do this with the blackness and yellowness and other things until they are purged.
Therefore, if what I have said at the beginning of this discourse is sufficient, then that is good; but if not, then you should repeat the treatment for several days in a row until it reaches the final outcome that you desire.
And know that teeth require many types of different incisions and shapes, depending on what is required for your operation. And so, since the incisions made on the surface of the tooth from the inside are different from those made between the teeth, you must prepare various forms of incisions. Here are some of them:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth for its pain with all due care and patience throughout the entire extraction process, because there is no reason to rush once it has been extracted, as this substance is sublimated in the process of extracting it.
But when the patient is forced to extract that tooth, you must be absolutely certain which one is causing pain, because many times pain can deceive the patient and make them think a healthy tooth is the source of discomfort, and so you extract the wrong one, and the pain does not cease until the truly diseased and painful tooth has been extracted. This we have seen through our experience as barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is causing pain, and you know it well, then you must make an incision around the tooth with a scalpel that has some sharpness, until the gum surrounding the tooth has been dissolved on all sides. Then use the instruments I have mentioned earlier to extract the tooth gently and slowly, little by little, until it is completely removed.
And then place the patient's head in your lap and use large forceps with strong tongs to grasp the tooth firmly but gently, holding it in such a way that you do not harm the patient or cause further pain. Then extract the tooth carefully, ensuring that you do not break it or increase the patient's discomfort.
And so, if you have not forgotten, take one of those instruments and gently place it under the tooth from all sides with ease and apply gentle force to remove it as I explained at the beginning.
But if the tooth is broken or decayed, then you must wrap it in a cloth and tie it with a thin thread to prevent it from breaking further during your manipulation of it using forceps.
It is necessary to make precise incisions in the gum surrounding the tooth on all sides and be very careful not to break it while keeping it separated from the gum tissue, as the pain after extraction can be worse than the initial discomfort for the patient.
And be careful not to make the same mistake that some ignorant barbers do when they extract teeth without administering the recommended remedies, causing great harm and more difficult conditions for their patients. They often leave broken tooth fragments or pieces of jawbone behind, leading to further complications and more severe problems.
And then rinse the mouth with wine vinegar or wine and salt after extracting the tooth.
And if there is excessive bleeding after the extraction, use some ground egg white and sprinkle it on the wound to stop the bleeding, or cauterize the area if it does not work.
The shape of the forceps and fine tweezers used to extract the tooth should have a long shank, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not bend when using them.
And they should have a thick handle so that when you apply force with them, they do not bend, and their shanks should be short.
And they should be made of Indian steel, with straight shanks and opposing teeth that interlock and grip the tooth firmly during extraction. Some have a shape like the beak of a stork, also known as a pelican, which provides strong traction for removing stubborn or impacted teeth.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and removal of fractured jawbones.
When you need to extract a tooth that is fractured and has remaining fragments, then you should apply a compress to the affected area for one or two days until it becomes softer. Then use tweezers with slender shanks that resemble the beak of a bird called the stork or pelican, similar to forceps in shape:
The shanks of these instruments should be sharpened on the inside like a file or rasp.
If the tooth does not respond to your efforts with these forceps or tweezers, then you must saw through the gum tissue surrounding it and use a small tool called an atalon, which is a small lever with this shape:
And it should have a short, thick handle that is not rounded, to prevent it from slipping or breaking during use.
Therefore, if the gum tissue is too thick and prevents you from using the atalon, then it's fine. In that case, use these other instruments with these shapes: the first one has a triangular shank with some thickness to it.
The shape of the second instrument is also triangular but with a finer tip.
And now you can use this instrument, which has two curved ends with this shape: And also use these other instruments for tooth filing, which I will describe later. The one that is useful for this purpose resembles a large onion and has this shape:
It has a triangular and curved or short tip with some thickness to prevent it from breaking during use.
And you should know that the instruments of the teeth are also similar to other instruments.
But skilled and subtle artisans in the art can find for themselves, according to what the operation and various diseases signify to them; because they are of the diseases that the ancients did not name or assign a specific instrument to, due to the different forms of various species.
But if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are fractured or dislocated, then treat it in its place with appropriate instruments and forceps, as we have said in the extraction of dental roots. And help yourself with a gesture, the form of which is as follows:
And gradually reduce any swelling, and constrict or hold it with the mouth so that it does not expand or escape until the bone is fully healed; then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a small fracture in the bone, then remove that piece of the fracture and its blackness, and heal it until it is cured.
Chapter 32.
Chapter 32: On the treatment of teeth that protrude more than others.
When teeth protrude unnaturally, and especially when they are close to women or more specifically to young girls of marriageable age, it is necessary to consider the following: if a tooth does not have enough space next to another tooth, and there is no possibility of extraction or any kind of movement, then root that tooth; but make sure it is not connected to another tooth. If the tooth is too close to another tooth, then you should cut it using this instrument, which has the following shape: it resembles a pig's snout and is made of Indian steel with an extremely sharp tip.
And make your incision such that you can cut the tooth in a few days due to its hardness, and avoid damaging other teeth.
And if it is an exposed tooth that needs to be filed down, then file it using a file made of Indian steel, which has the following shape:
And let the entire file be made of Indian steel, with many small teeth like those on a needle-making awl, and with which the tooth can be filed down little by little over several days with ease, in order to avoid damaging other teeth or causing pain. And at the end, smooth it out, and remove any rough edges using a razor.
And if it is a tooth where a piece has broken off and is causing discomfort to the tongue, then you should file that part down until its roughness is removed and covered over, and filled in so that the tongue does not become irritated or the speech impaired.
Chapter 33.
Chapter 33: On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver alloy.
When teeth are damaged due to blows or accidents that result in concussion or removal, and the patient is unable to chew properly, and you have treated them with styptic medicines without success, then for the reason that silver alloy can become tarnished and discolored over time, it is better to use gold alloy for reinforcing those teeth, which will never change color.
And let the alloy be of such fineness and coarseness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the shape of the restoration is as follows: take the alloy and place twice its volume between two healthy teeth, and then gradually increase the thickness of the alloy using two curved shapes on either side of the damaged teeth, until the alloy reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process on the other side of the damaged tooth, building up the thickness of the alloy gradually until it reaches the healthy tooth on that side as well, taking care not to cause any further damage in the process.
And let your strip be the one with which you strengthen the alloy of the teeth, so that it does not become loose or fall out.
And then trim away any excess alloy using forceps or tweezers, and add those trimmings to the restoration in each location with gentle movements, and shape those trimmings so that they fit snugly between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so as not to cause injury to the tongue. And then let it sit as tight as a Roman.
But if it becomes loose or broken, then strengthen it again with more alloy in the same manner and at any time necessary.
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as shown in the following illustration:
And when it is necessary to return one or more teeth to their proper position and alignment after they have been dislodged or knocked out of place, and they have healed properly, and they are still weakened.
And only a skilled and wise artisan should do this.
And sometimes a bone from a cow is prepared for some reason and made in the shape of a tooth, and then placed in the location where the tooth is missing, and held in place with wire as we have described, and remains there and serves its purpose for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Chapter 34: On making an incision in a tongue tie that impedes speech.
This tongue tie can sometimes be present from birth, or it can develop naturally as a person grows, or it can occur accidentally due to an injury or illness that has already healed.
The procedure for this is as follows: have the patient open their mouth and hold their head steady with your left hand while you use your right hand to lift their tongue. Then carefully make an incision in the connective tissue, cutting it along its length until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if there is any hardness or thickening in the tissue due to consolidation from an injury, then you should apply caustic agents and cut through it along its length until you have completely severed the ligament and removed the obstruction.
And be careful not to make a deep cut in the tissue and cause it to bleed excessively, potentially leading to infection or other complications.
Then clean the wound with water or vinegar or warm water, and place a ligature beneath the tongue to hold it in place. This is a small piece of cloth or other material that keeps the tongue from healing too tightly to the floor of the mouth again.
But if there is bleeding, apply a styptic agent such as verdigris to the wound. If the bleeding persists, use a hot iron cautery to seal the wound and stop the bleeding. And continue this treatment until the wound has healed completely.
Chapter 35.
Chapter 35: On the removal of a ranula beneath the tongue.
Sometimes, a collection of pus forms beneath the tongue that resembles a small node or swelling, which can interfere with normal speech and swallowing. This condition can quickly worsen and spread to fill the entire mouth.
And the operation on them is to open the patient's mouth wide towards the sun and observe the abscess.
And if you see it as dark or black in color, hard, and the patient cannot feel it, then do not touch it because it is malignant.
And if it turns white and is wet, then put a dram (unit of weight) of it in there, insert a slender spatula, and cut it all around; and if blood comes out during your operation, place wax on top for three hundred counts, that is, verdigris, until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your work until you have completed it, until it has been washed with vinegar and salt; and treat the other part as well until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of abscesses from both ears and that which is located in the throat, as well as other abscesses.
When abscesses occur in the throat, they are glands that are gathered and swollen, which come out externally and are called tonsils, and when you treat them with what we have mentioned in the procedure and it is not healed, then you should consider whether the abscess is hard, dark colored, with little sensation; if so, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color and the swelling is large, then do not touch that with iron because of the flow of blood; first, let it mature inside, and then either you will remove it or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its size is small, then that one must be cut open.
And the operation on it is to consider before your operation whether the abscess has rested enough after being cauterized with complete rest or if it has decreased in size; and then make the patient face the sun, hold their head towards you, open their mouth, and have a servant take an instrument with noble shape between their hands, pressing down on the tongue of the patient to expose the area, as follows:
And it should be made of silver or silk, and it should be fine like a knife.
Therefore, when you press with that and the abscess is exposed to you, place your medicine on top of it, then take a dram (unit of weight) and insert it into the incision, and pull out as much of it from the inside as possible. Or when you pull out something that is from the membranes, then return to cutting it with an instrument of this shape:
Or when you pull out something that is from the membranes, then return to cutting it with an instrument of this shape: and it is shaped like forceps, but the ends of it are curved inward so that the orifices of each side face each other, making them sharp, with iron that is plated inside.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a spatula that looks like this: And it should be sharp on one side, but not sharp on the other side.
And after you have cut one abscess, cut the other one in the same manner, and then dress the wound of the patient with fresh water.
But if blood starts to flow, dress the wound with a decoction of black elderberry or myrtle leaves and similar to those with styptic properties until the bleeding stops, and then treat it until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two tonsils, and cut these in the same manner as I have described for two abscesses.
And I have treated a woman with an abscess that had appeared in her throat, which was dark colored and had little sensation, and she had closed off her own throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and she had been prohibited from eating or drinking water, and she had already reached the brink of death if it had not been for one or two days.
And the abscess had already grown so large that it had been two months since it erupted through two openings.
Therefore, I carefully inserted my finger into one of his buttocks and pulled out the large piece that was stuck there. Then I made an incision in the other side where the abscess extended, and I opened the mouth of the abscess, and compressed its tongue. Afterwards, I inserted the instrument into the abscess.
Then I cut out a large portion of it, and only a small amount of blood came out. Therefore, the procedure for that woman was completed, and she began to drink water and eat solid food shortly after. And I continued to incise the abscess many times over a long period of time, and new abscesses formed in place of the old one, which persisted until it was completely healed.
Then I applied a bandage and cauterized the wound, thus completing the procedure. And I walked away, not knowing what God would do with it afterwards.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On incising a tumor when it has become an abscess.
When there is a catarrhal inflammation of the tonsil and it becomes an abscess and grows long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is large and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo. [\[1\]\](https://books.google.com/books?id=HgYTAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA396)
But when it has healed with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your treatment, and sometimes an abscess that has been cauterized remains and is subtle, then it is necessary to incise the one that has formed around it; and if it is next to the longitude, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and not at the same level, then it is necessary to try to incise it, because there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the method that I have said regarding its whiteness and length, then you should make the patient lie down and press their tongue with an instrument of the type used in the procedure described earlier, and place the incision tool on the new growth, and pull downwards and incise it with one of two instruments mentioned in the incision of tumors.
And it is necessary that you only incise what is appropriate up to the natural limit without adding more, because if you incise too much, you will damage their voice.
And during the incision, use what we recommended in the incision of tumors, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary to use a bandage during the cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization in them is only with hot water, and it is that you place the head of the patient on your lap, and press their tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have spoken about in the chapter on cauterization, and pour it over the live coals, and hold it not too thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument with this, which has this shape:
Let the external part of the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the tonsil, and let the patient lean over their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth does not fall onto the wound caused by the internal medicine. Therefore, make sure that no cause remains on the wound and that it heals properly.
And then place your hand with the medicine on it and press it onto the tonsil, and express the medicine over the tonsil for half an hour until you see that it has become blackened and numbed due to the effect of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of a rod, and dip the cotton in the medicine, and insert the rod with the cotton into a suction cannula until the cotton adheres to the cannula, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve the desired result from the cauterization of the tonsil, and then leave it alone so that it dries and falls off on its own after three or four days.
And if you see that the medicine needs to be repeated, then repeat it, and for the cauterization, clean the area around the tonsil with a cotton swab soaked in boric acid, and remove any remaining medication from around the tonsil using the same method, and wash it with warm water, and clean it outside with an ointment, and treat it inside with dressings until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and more effective than cauterization through fear.
Sometimes the tonsil is healed with a method that is more subtle than cauterization or incision, because it is cured by sublimation in this way: take chamomile, hyssop, oregano, rue, scordium, chamomile, broom and similar herbs. Grind all these ingredients together, or some of them, into a powder and mix them with vinegar. Boil the mixture until it is properly cooked, and strain it through a cloth so that only the liquid remains. Place this liquid in a basin, and make a hole in the middle of the basin. On top of the hole, place an instrument made of silver or brass in the shape of a spoon, which will allow the vapor to rise up through the hole.
And the end of the instrument should be inserted into the patient's mouth so that the vapor reaches the tonsil and envelopes it completely until the tonsil is thoroughly fogged up.
And then repeat this process many times until it is dry, but be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess or boil, because it would be too harsh and would not be appropriate. Instead, you should diagnose whether it is a boil that needs to be cauterized.
But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a reed and fashion a stopper at the end of it using egg white, so that the patient's mouth is propped open, because the egg white stops the vapor from burning their mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38
On the extraction of splinters and things that stick in the throat and other causes.
Often things get stuck in the throat, such as a fish bone or some other cause.
Then you should remove what is visible and obvious, by looking carefully and pressing the tongue down with an instrument, so that you can see clearly what is in the throat.
And what is not visible and hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before the food has digested in the stomach, because often the attached cause will be expelled from the throat by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of napkin or lettuce leaf or a piece of dry bread; or give them a piece of sea sponge soaked in strong vinegar, and then have them swallow it, because when it reaches the location of the splinter, it will be expelled. Or take an eel and tie it with vinegar, place it on a plate and let it be slowly extracted; or take a piece of garlic and insert it and then remove it slowly.
But if the splinter is not expelled by these methods, then use an instrument made of lead in this way:
And it should be slightly thicker than a little finger, with a concavity at the end that you can easily insert into their throat.
And have them hold their head up and make sure that the instrument does not touch their throat bones, in order to avoid causing damage or pushing the splinter further in, or having them place their own hand over it.
But it is better if the patient can swallow it more easily, by using their knowledge of where the attached cause is and guiding it downwards, and then pulling up with the instrument in their hand, all according to the length that has been prepared for insertion until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the removal of bloodsuckers attached to the throat.
When a bloodsucker is treated with what has been said in the division of treatment by medicine and not by cupping, you should then look at the patient's throat with their tongue pressed down using the instrument that we recommended.
Then if you see the bloodsucker, remove it gently with a small hook or with delicate movements.
And if you are unable to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, place a hot iron in the concavity of the cannula, do this several times (until the bloodsucker is dead and has fallen out of the throat) and prevent the patient from consuming any water for the whole day.
And have them take a filled horn of water and rinse their mouth with it, wash their mouth out with the horn; and do not swallow anything from it and spit out any residue after an hour, because the bloodsucker will soon come out when it senses the water.
But if it is not expelled by the methods recommended, then fumigate the patient with cinquefoil or asafoetida using the instrument that we recommended for fumigating the uvula.
Do this three times.
And here is another method of operation in the fumigation of it: take a pot with burning coals and cover it with a blanket, making sure there is a hole in it where you can insert the end of the instrument; then perform the fumigation from above and place the patient's mouth on the end of the cannula, closing their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you are certain that the fumigation has reached the bloodsucker, because the bloodsucker will soon fall out. [
And if it does not come out, then you should repeat the fumigation several times and prevent the patient from drinking water, eating salty foods or garlic, and they must not drink water, it is necessary to follow this regimen until it comes out.
And this is the form of the instrument used to treat bloodsuckers in the throat when they are visible. It resembles forceps but has some curvature. The end of the instrument is curved like a stork's beak and has a grip, sharpened with a file, so that when it compresses any cause, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the lecture on abscesses, with an overview of their types.
Abscesses are many species and varieties, as will be remembered from this book, each with their own characteristics.
And they are diverse in their formation and section in two ways: one is due to the type of abscess itself, and the other is because of the moisture that accumulates.
And the second way is specific to the areas of the body where they occur, because an abscess in the head is different from one in the buttocks, and an abscess on the fleshy part of the body is different from one at a joint, each requiring its own treatment through surgery.
And there are some types of abscesses that should not be pierced until they have matured or healed completely.
And there are other types of abscesses that should be pierced when they are still fresh and have not matured completely, such as those near joints because when an abscess forms near a joint, its contents are drawn into the joint causing damage to ligaments or nerves leading to contraction of the limb; or if it is located close to a major organ, piercing should be done before it matures in order to prevent damage to the organ; or if it is near the buttocks, it should not be allowed to mature completely because there is a risk of infection spreading to internal organs and creating a fistula. The same applies to abscesses located in sensitive areas that may not heal properly. And it is necessary to know the time for piercing the abscess, and this should be done when it has matured.
And you should know that it is mature when there is a decrease in pain and fever, and the swelling has reduced, as well as the pulse rate, and the hardness of the abscess has softened, along with other signs. [
And it is important to know that the incision should be made below the abscess, and pus allowed to drain from the elevation of the abscess.
And incisions should always be made in the direction of the skin or body tissue, especially when abscesses are located on the sides of the limbs, wrists, nerves, arteries, and other areas where there is a risk of reflection. In such cases, use incisions that follow the shape of the member.
And when an abscess is located in fleshy areas, it is better to wait until digestion is confirmed before making an incision, as mentioned earlier, because if the incision is made too early, there is a risk of pus and other matter being spread deeper into the tissue, causing hardening of the wound edges and increasing its depth. [
But some abscesses should be pierced according to the width of the skin or body tissue, depending on necessity or based on the needs of the member.
And it is necessary to make small incisions in small abscesses, and larger incisions in large ones, with multiple sections if the abscess is very large.
And there are other types of abscesses where it is necessary to make a concave incision and suture the wound closed, when it has healed enough, such as those that occur in areas with thick skin like on the back or buttocks. [
And there are those that are incised with a section having three angles, and these include the type of abscess incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, such as those seen on soldiers or athletes. [
And there are those where a round or crescent-shaped incision is made, similar to these. [
But for those where there is no need for a deep incision, such as in the case of shallow abscesses, a surface or shallow incision will suffice.
And it is necessary that when an abscess is large and has accumulated much pus, you should incise it but do not worry about removing all the pus in one go. Instead, remove a portion of the pus and then pack the wound, repeating this process over several days until the abscess has fully drained.
And especially if the patient is frail or weak, such as a child, elderly person, or someone with fever, because their vital spirit can be easily weakened by the release of pus and they may become seriously ill or even die from the surgery.
And be cautious when performing incisions on abscesses, and consider the condition of the wound after making the incision. If the wound is small or flat, use a mild antiseptic to clean it. But if the abscess is large and there are multiple incisions, then pack each one with sterile gauze until they heal together.
And if part of the skin has been cut away or you have made a concave incision in the abscess, then use a piece of old cloth or linen thread to stitch it up on the third day and process and care for it with appropriate bandages until it heals.
But if there is a flow of blood during the surgery, then use a cloth soaked in water and vinegar to stop the bleeding by applying it directly to the wound. Repeat this several times until the bleeding stops.
But if the bleeding continues, then you should apply the recommended treatments and powders that I have mentioned in various parts of this book and division.
But if the abscess is located in a nerve-rich area and it's wintertime, then you should apply poultices of vinegar and oil to the wound to prevent nerve damage.
And if it's summer and the wound is located in fleshy areas, then you should apply poultices soaked in water and oil or vinegar and oil for three days, as previously mentioned, before cleaning and dressing the wound with appropriate treatments until it heals.
This is what is necessary for the understanding of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the method of distinction, I have already mentioned in general about every abscess how its treatment is in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
On the incision of abscesses which occur in the skull.
Small abscesses in the skull are of the type that contain tunics according to their nature; and their types are many.
And they have pus, and some contain moisture similar to lime. And there are those that contain moisture similar to dust, and resembling them; and there are those that are stony, hard.
And in the incision and extraction of all of them, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause opposite reactions.
And the operation in incising them is that you probe with an instrument of a form approaching this, which is called a trocar, until you know that it contains pus.
Therefore, if what it contains is moisture, then you incise it with an incision along its length in a surface manner according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G. When the moisture has been evacuated, then you excise that which contains the moisture and leave no cause of it at all, for too often the abscess returns if any cause remains.
And then immerse a compress in Egyptian ointment if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it in for another day, for with this it will corrode everything that remains of that skin.
And then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment to the compress a second and third time if necessary until you are confident that there is no remnant cause of the skin; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess contains hard nodes, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision having the shape of a cross, and make seven incisions between two lips of the incision and cut it from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your efforts are met with opposition, then do what I have told you in the first place.
And similarly do for an abscess that has become stony and in its incision and treatment as I have told you; and the incision on a stony abscess is easier because it contains little blood and little moisture.
Sometimes there are hard lumps in these abscesses that are found in the heads of some men who do not have any moisture at all; the cause of this is because once I made an incision on an abscess in the head of an old woman and found it to be as hard as a stone, rough, white, which could not be pierced, and if anyone were struck with it, they would be injured.
But in other abscesses that occur in the head, it is not as in this chapter, such as those that occur on children's heads and near their ears, but the incision for all of these should be surface level.
And place the opening of these at the lower part of them, so that the body may be relieved of pus in the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is necessary for treatment.
Chapter 42.
On the incision of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, armpits, and groin; and sometimes they appear in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many of them are generated between them, and all scrofula is contained within its own membrane, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have mentioned before.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for some are stony, and others contain moisture, and there are also those that are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore, in the case where you see it to be well-disposed to treatment, and its color is similar to that of the neck, and it is soft on all sides, not attached to the nerves of the neck, veins, or sinews, and not prominent, then you should incise it with a dry surface incision from above to below the body along the line from G to B. Cut it entirely and remove two flaps of skin with an incision using one or more ounces as needed, just as we mentioned in the treatment of abscesses on the head, and extract it gently piece by piece.
And it is more important to be careful not to cut the vein or nerve.
And let the spatula not be too sharp, so that it does not fit your hand during incision or disturb the patient, and cut only what is necessary to be cut. If you accidentally cut a vein or sinew, then stop your operation and apply poultices of verdigris tristessa or other powders that stop bleeding and tighten the wound, leaving it in place until the acuity of the abscess has subsided and the wound has softened and begun to rot. When blood has been cut.
And return to your operation until it is completed.
And then ask with your touch if there are any remaining causes of other small scrofulas, and incise those and clean them out.
And if it is at the site of the large vein, then you should not incise that scrofula on its site. Before that, it is necessary for you to apply double-strength gall and leave it in place until it falls out by itself without causing harm.
And then fill the wound with old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment and treat it accordingly.
And if you incise the entire scrofulous abscess, then it is necessary for you to bring together the two sides of the wound and remove as much pus as possible without leaving any excess.
If you see that there is an excess due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary to consider making an incision in it, and then straighten it out and administer sutures, and what is called that.
And for the scrofula that contains moisture, make a superficial perforation in it at the location where you see signs of maturation on it, and place a perforation in it of what dries pus from the body, just as we have said.
Then administer perforation, with hot compresses and similar things, in order to erode what is broken by corruption. And when you see the wound already cleaned, then cure it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On the incision of the abscess' pustule on the thigh.
The ancients called this incision in the pustule, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it.
And this is the title of the discourse of those people.
But in men with gout, it is necessary to avoid incising the pustule, because doing so would not bring any benefit, since all of the patient's veins and major vessels are located here.
But for those who have abscesses in the mouth or thighs or ears, when the illness is not in the marrow, it is necessary to have incisions of the pustule performed in order to avoid the danger that is caused by perforation.
Therefore, it is necessary when we want that, to incise the pustule below three circles of the pustule or four with a small incision along its length in the area that is between two circles by quantity, so that the incision is evenly distributed and not in the cartilage, and this location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and contains vessels that carry blood.
And if the doctor is afraid, then it is necessary to extend the thigh muscle with a one-ounce weight and then make an incision in the muscle so that it reaches the canal, but avoid the blood vessels for any reason.
And then incise the ligaments as we have recommended, and it is meant along the incision of the canal by flame, which comes from that which is broken and through the rupture of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
And when the time comes when incision is feared, add two lips of muscle to the wound, and stitch only the cartilage.
And then administer medications that promote tissue growth until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the essence of this discourse is nothing more than seeing that some of these abscesses have filled the thigh of the patient, and the patient has come to death, and the air in the wound has become contaminated, and they go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the location of the wound for some air, and be saved from death.
And for that reason, I command leaving the wound open until the evil of the illness has been consumed; and the evil of it lasts for three days; and therefore I command treating the wound in this way and curing it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself is that a maidservant took a knife and stabbed it into her own thigh and cut open part of the ribcage near her lung, and I was called to treat her, and I found her mouth making the sound like the moaning of the dying, and discovered the wound, and found blood which was flowing out of the wound in small quantities.
Therefore, I was able to confirm that she had not cut a vein or artery, but rather the air was flowing out of the wound, and I treated her until it was healed.
And the maidservant did not experience any difficulty breathing, and after several days she regained her strength and normal functioning.
And now I say that in incising the pustule, there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
On incising an abscess that occurs on the outside of the thigh, which is called a "hernia of the thigh."
This abscess, which is called a "hernia of the thigh," is a large abscess that appears according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is of two types: one is natural and the other is accidental.
And the natural one is not to be cured.
And the accidental one is of two types: one appears similar to fatty nodes, and the other type appears similar to an abscess that is caused by inflammation of an artery, and in this case there is fear. And one must not be presumptuous in treating it with iron (i.e., surgical instruments) except in cases where the abscess is small. And you should probe the abscess and investigate it with the method described earlier. If you find that it resembles fatty nodes, and is not connected to any veins, then you should incise it in the same way as you would a node, and extract it along with its contents and surrounding tissue. However, if this is not the case, then you should carefully examine the entire area and provide appropriate care until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On incising different types of nodes.
There are many species of large nodes, and I have already discussed all the types of them in the division (i.e., classification).
And it is necessary for me to explain the difference between a node and an exit, in cases where there may be uncertainty.
Therefore, I say that with an exit, there is heat and fever, as well as intense pain, until the boiling of the excess fluid has subsided. It is a complete putrefaction that ultimately leads to the cessation of fever, pain, and heat.
But with a node, there is no heat or fever or pain, and it contains only the amount of fluid that belongs to its own sac.
And it is determined by the color of the body, and its appearance is similar to that of a swelling or boil, regardless of whether it is large or small. There are two types of nodes: those that are fatty and contain moisture, with many different colors of fluid, as I have mentioned in the classification section.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, you must extract it and investigate its appearance using an instrument called an explorer, according to its shape as described in the following chapter.
And this is a method of inquiry for abscesses and all types of nodes: that you take this instrument and insert it gently into the moist location that you find in the abscess, and you move your fingers along with the instrument little by little until you are certain that it has penetrated the muscle.
And then place your hand over the wound according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the instrument and examine what has come out in its trail.
And if the fluid is expelled by itself, regardless of its color, then you should incise it with a superficial section, just as I have described for other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture left in the wound, then you know it is pus.
And let it dry on the wound, forming a cross in this shape: [Here add an image of a cross as the text describes a visual representation.] just as you have been taught, and suspend that on a string, and carefully remove the scab from all sides with ease, and save the skin or sac if possible, over it and extract the pus with a knot.
But if it breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the pus, and often attempts are made at this, then you extract it piece by piece until no cause remains in it.
Because if any cause remains, be it little or much, the knot will return accordingly.
And if you see that a small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and strengthen the area, place a cauterizing agent over it to stop the abscess, and heal the other side with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large knot, then you sew the two lips of it and heal it with what festers.
But if it comes with a pulse in the opposite direction, or without one, then you apply and fill the area with 300 grains of quicklime, which is vitriol, and leave it to dry for two or three days until the wound dries out and the boiling of the blood stops; and then return to cutting what has hardened from the knot.
Chapter XLVI. (46)
On the forms of the necessary instruments in cutting and piercing.
Of these, there are the forms of the knives, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small.
The form of the large knife is as follows: [Here add an image of a large knife as the text describes a visual representation.]
The form of the small knife is as follows: [Here add an image of a small knife as the text describes a visual representation.]<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rZJXm9P.png" title="Small Knife" alt="Small Knife Image">
They are made of iron, with well-rounded ends, so that the instruments can be quickly inserted into abscesses.
And these are the forms of the tools, and they are called bistouris, and one of them is called berid.[Note: The term "bistouris" refers to surgical knives or lancets used in medieval medicine. The term "berid" specifically refers to a type of knife with a curved blade, often used for cutting and draining abscesses.]
And they come in three types: large, medium, and small.
The form of the large tool is as follows:[Here add an image of a large bistouri or surgical knife as the text describes a visual representation.]
The form of the medium tool is as follows: [Here add an image of a medium bistouri or surgical knife as the text describes a visual representation.]<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rZJXm9P.png" title="Medium Bistouri" alt="Medium Bistouri Image">
The form of the small tool is as follows: [Here add an image of a small bistouri or surgical knife as the text describes a visual representation.]
It is appropriate to use these tools for abscesses, incisions, and fistulas and buboes, as they are useful in reaching the bones or other causes.
And the round tools are thick and blunt, like large needles used for sewing saddles, made of hardened citron wood or iron or silver, and the best ones are those made of hardened citron wood.
And the tools made of black horn are also used, which serve to open up the fistulas in the concavity where their reflection is directed by the lightness of the tool and its reflection.
And they come in three types: some are long, others medium-length, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of the large black horn tool is as follows: [Here add an image of a large black horn tool as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma del experient migier de plom:**
The form of the medium-length black horn tool is as follows: [Here add an image of a medium-length black horn tool as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma del experient pauc de plom:**
The form of the small black horn tool is as follows: [Here add an image of a small black horn tool as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma del experient gran de eram citri:**
The forms of the strings are of many types, as some are simple strings with only one curve and they come in three sizes: large, small, and medium.
And their strings are made of rawhide, and they also come in three types.
And there are also strings with two curves, and they come in three types.
And their strings have three curves, and they also come in three types.
And all of these are necessary for their respective purposes.
The form of a small single-curved string is as follows: [Here add an image of a small single-curved string as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de unci doble pauc:**
The form of large double-curved strings is as follows: [Here add an image of large double-curved strings as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de uncis pauc havent doas curvaturas:** The form of medium double-curved strings is as follows: [Here add an image of medium double-curved strings as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de uncis orps havent tres curvaturas:** The form of small double-curved strings is as follows: [Here add an image of small double-curved strings as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de uncis migiers havent tres curvaturas:**
The form of large triple-curved strings is as follows: [Here add an image of large triple-curved strings as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de uncis pauc havent tres curvaturas:**
The form of medium triple-curved strings is as follows: [Here add an image of medium triple-curved strings as the text describes a visual representation.] [**Forma de uncis pauc havent doas curvaturas:**
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodules and abscesses are cut and shelled, and they are of three kinds, for some are large, medium, and small.
Form of large scalpel:
Form of medium scalpel:
Form of small scalpel:
The extremities of those with which incisions are made are sharp and the others are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, but rather so as to provide assistance in the excision of nodules, and through them the patient may heal and find some relief from the inflammation that results from the excoriation of the abscess.
And these are the forms of almagis, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and similar to a needle with which alcohol is made.
And it is in the punctured extremity, hidden by the spatula, and runs to the interior and exterior parts, when you wish, as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the teeth during the incision of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of leeches with which the flow of blood is cut off, and they are of three kinds; large, medium, and small; the forms of them:
They are made of iron, round and with some length, and they are fine.
And it is necessary that these kinds of leeches be large, medium and small, in order to cut off the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and at other times when there is no medicine.
However, do not use those to cut off blood in any part of the body, but only in fleshy parts, such as on the thighs and hips, and on the arms and breasts, and belly and groin, and similar to these fleshy and moist parts.
And some of those instruments are small and similar to the shells of purses with this form; through which blood is cut off when it is done by venesection or incision of a vein or an artery.
And some times they are made round, according to this form:
Capital 47.
On the care of male breasts which resemble those of women.
Some times the breasts of some men become swollen after falling asleep as they begin to be touched, and at other times they become swollen and similar to women's breasts, and distant abscesses, remote.
And for whoever suffers from this, it is necessary to incise those with lunar section according to this form, from line B to line G, and at other times excoriate all the thickening, and at other times fill the wound with carminative medicine, and at other times adjust the two lips of the wound with suturing, and cure inside so that it heals.
But if the breast tilts towards the lower parts and is softened by its size just like it does in women, then it should be cut in two along its upper sides with two sections similar to a lunar figure, of which each one should be contained within the other until the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form of the line B and the line G. And at other times, excoriate the cyst that is between the two lips of the wound, remove the fatty tissue, and administer what we have said about suturing and powders, as necessary in the cure until it heals.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised due to the patient's discomfort and blood flow, then it is necessary to fill the wound with a piece of linen saturated in corrosive ointment and leave it there so that it corrodes the dead flesh, and then heal the inside so that it heals.
Chapter 48.
On the incision of abscesses that form below the nipple.
These abscesses that form below the nipple are of the nature of scrofula (tuberculous swelling), hard and covered by a membrane.
And some of these (abscesses) contain fluid; and those that contain fluid should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from point G to point B. And once all the pus is drained from the abscess, then fill it with dry linen and leave it for another day.
Then apply a dressing that stops the bleeding and treat it with an appropriate ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the nature of lymph nodes or scrofula, then incise it in the same way as described in the section on scrofula.
But if the wound is extensive and prone to gangrene, then administer cautery as was mentioned before this.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the incision of abscesses that result from arteries or veins.
When an artery is ruptured and the swelling has solidified above it, then many abscesses often result. And the signs by which one can recognize that inflammation and abscess are due to the artery or vein: for when the abscess comes from an artery, it is long and attached to the body's surface; and if you press on the abscess with your fingers, you will feel a hissing sound in it.
And that which is due to a vein is round and close to the body's surface.
Incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in those that are below the armpits, and on the shins, and on the neck, and in many places on the body; for it is large, therefore its healing with iron (cautery) should be avoided; and those that are on the extremities or on the head, should be avoided.
But in those that are on the side due to inflammation of the orifice of an artery, incise in a longitudinal section through the swelling; and then spread apart the incision with forceps, and approach the artery, and free it from its sheaths so that it is exposed.
Then place a needle over it and make it penetrate the other side; then tighten the artery with double-strength wire in two places, - which causes clotting in the extraction of two arteries that are only found in temple regions (temples).
Then press the area that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood in it has been expelled and the abscess has resolved.
Then apply treatment to cause gangrene in the area until the ligaments have fallen off, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until healed.
And if the abscess is due to incision of a vein, then place your hand as close as possible to the abscess on the swelling, and then insert the needle under the area where you had your hand; make it penetrate through; and let the double fil pass through in such a way that you can extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with strong ligament as I said to you earlier, with two parts of the fil with two ends.
But if you are afraid that the fil will not be extracted, then insert the wire with the needle under all of the abscess along the incision of the first needle, and tighten your wires in four places.
Then dry out the abscess in its middle until what is inside it comes out, and then incise the excess swelling, leaving behind whatever is attached to it.
Then place on top of it a piece of cloth that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then apply the treatment made with leeches and ointments until healed.
Chapter L (50) of the abscess that results from nerve twisting.
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery or vein, likewise an abscess can occur in nerves when there is a blow or excessive pressure, and so on.
And it is most often found in the joints of the arms or legs, or in any location where the joints are affected.
And this is a serious abscess, resembling the color of other parts of the body, and when it is tightly constricted with intensity, the patient appears to be in a state of stupor.
And this is not an abscess that forms on the body's surface, but rather it occurs beneath the skin and affects all parts equally without going to either the front or back parts.
Therefore, in those that occur in the joints, it is not advisable to seal them with iron, because they will easily become constricted.
But in those that occur on the head or forehead, make an incision through the skin using a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then extract it with forceps and cut it with scissors.
And if it is large, then use forceps to lift it up, scrape it clean and cover the opening with a dressing; close the wound with stitches and treat it until healed.
Chapter 51.
On the incision of abscesses that occur in the navel (or belly button).
Often in men's navels and other parts of their bodies, there are many small growths resembling mushrooms, with fine roots and thick caps; these have fused labia, can be small or greatly enlarged.
I have seen one where there were two parts on the man's navel that resembled mushrooms even more closely, with no difference between their white roots and fine stems.
And the lips of these growths were turned inward and split open, with moisture constantly flowing from them.
Therefore, I incised these growths and found one to weigh 18 ounces. And the other weighed five ounces.
And the procedure for incising them involves considering whether the patient is moist, and if their skin is white, moist, with fine roots. In this case, you should make a wide incision using a spatula, while having cautery tools ready in the fire, because often much blood will flow from the incision, so be prepared to cauterize it if necessary.
And if the patient is weak and fearful, avoid making an incision with iron; instead, prepare a fresh lead filament, strengthen it with that skin, in the manner described earlier, and leave it for two days.
And then tighten the lead wire in a slow and gradual manner until it is completely cut and falls off by itself without any effort.
But if the skin is thick, there may be reason for fear and anxiety during the incision, especially in those on the navel.
But it is possible to incise the thickness of it, and then cauterize the area to prevent regrowth.
And then treat it until the wound heals.
And be careful not to assume that you should incise a skin that is of dark color, with little sensation, and irregular shape, for this is most likely cancer.
And I will come back with a reminder about cancer later.
Capital LII
On the treatment of prominence of the navel.
A protrusion of the navel can be caused by several reasons; either from ruptures in the ciphac, which is located above the belly, and causes the membrane or intestine to come out as with other ruptures; or from blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or from constrained flatulence within it.
But if it is due to a rupture in the ciphac and the protrusion of the membrane, then the abscess will have a similar color as the body; it is usually painless, and its appearance varies depending on its location. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance will be more varied and noticeable, and when you press on it with your fingers, it disappears and returns easily; but it quickly reappears and becomes enlarged, especially during bowel movements and strenuous activity.
But if it is due to fluid retention, then it is painless and does not disappear when pressed with the hand; it is neither constricted nor swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess will have darkened discoloration as one of its symptoms.
And if it is due to fatty tissue, then the abscess will be severe, large, and hard, and its size will correspond to a certain quantity.
And if it is due to flatulence, then the touch of it will be painless.
And the procedure for it is that you should consider whether the protrusion of the navel is due to bleeding from an artery or a vein, or flatulence; in such cases, you must refrain from treating it, as previously stated in the chapter where I discussed abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
And if the protrusion of the navel is due to intestines or membrane, then you should instruct the patient to keep their belly empty and stand upright; and then you should place a bandage around the entire navel, and order them to lie on their back between your hands on their stomach, and then apply a compress soaked in strong vinegar or rose oil around the navel along the marked area; and finally, tie the swelling to the surrounding areas with large needles and use proper binding methods.
And then press the middle of the swelling extended over the ligature and insert your finger into it to search for the intestine; and if you have found or secured it through the ligature, then you should pull it out gently and push the intestine towards the inner parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then you should take it with a needle and cut off its excess.
But if it is contrary to your artery or vein, then you should surround the swelling and return to your procedure; and take two needles and insert two strong threads into them in a cross shape, which you should place around the swelling that you have made, and pull the swelling tight in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area to heal by itself; or cut the thread when it thins out and becomes loose enough for the flesh to spread and fall on its own; and then take care of the wound with proper dressings until it heals completely.
And if the protrusion of the navel is due to fatty tissue or fluid retention, then you should empty the abscess as previously described and remove the blood or fluid that you find in it; and then take care of the wound with proper dressings until it heals completely.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed in the introduction the different types of cancer and how they can be treated with medicines, and that it is advisable to avoid surgery for fear of causing ulcers; and we have mentioned that caution is required in the treatment of cancer.
And the ancients have said that some cancers are located in places where they can be eradicated completely, such as cancer of the breast or groin and similar ones in other limbs, which can be removed entirely, especially when it starts small.
But when it is old and large, then you should not attempt to treat it because I have never seen such a patient recover or heard of anyone else who has; and it has not been documented in any medical literature.
And the procedure for it is when it has been located as we have described, to proceed and leave the patient and purge them of black bile several times, and then bleed them if there is clear evidence of congestion.
And then prepare the patient with preparation that includes the operation, and provide them with traction hooks which are necessary for it; and completely cover all parts of it with a well-cleaned concave surface, ensuring that there is no remaining cause or remnants of its roots. And let the blood flow, and do not lightly cut that place, and press on the swollen areas, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument that is within your means.
But if you are opposed to cutting deep into a vein or artery due to thick blood flow, then cauterize that area to stop the bleeding and care for it with another treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 50
Of the treatment of dropsy.
As we mentioned in the division, of the types of dropsy caused by water and their symptoms, we will now discuss treatment with medications.
And the type that is cured with iron is only the variety of ascites (altitas), and it should not be approached with iron for the varieties of tympanites or hydrothorax, as that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of dropsy called tympanites with medicines and they do not improve, then consider the situation, for if the patient is already weakened or has another illness, such as cough or abdominal pain, then be cautious about treating them with iron, as there is a risk involved.
But if you see that the patient is in good health, and their only illness is dropsy, and they are neither young nor old, then the method for operating on them is to lift the patient between your hands, place a container under their belly, and use their hand to press on their abdomen to expel the water. Then take a sponge with pointed corners and insert it in this way:
It should have two long, sharp points like a sponge, but it should be somewhat short and small, gradually increasing in length. This is to ensure that the intestines are not pierced during the operation and that they are gently moved aside.
And consider whether the dropsy is caused by an issue with the intestines, for in that case, you must make the incision three finger widths below the navel on the right side of the body.
But if the dropsy is caused by a liver disease, then make the incision on the left side of the navel at three finger widths.
And if the dropsy is caused by a spleen condition, then make the incision on the right side.
And it is not necessary for the incision to be made on the side where the patient will lie, as this may cause fluid to accumulate at that location.
Then use your instrument to puncture the entire abdominal wall, and insert it into the incision, lifting up with a sponge between the intestine and the peritoneum, and carefully remove any excess fluid, about the size of a fingernail or so.
Then puncture the spleen until the sponge reaches the empty space where the fluid is located. Then remove that and insert an instrument of this shape: and it resembles a thin silver cannula; it is made of silver, copper, or lead, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on either side. The end of it is sharpened like a feather quill, as you may have seen.
And at the highest point of the instrument is an armilla (a type of valve), which opens as soon as the instrument reaches the fluid, allowing it to drain in moderate quantities. This is important because draining too much fluid at once can be fatal for the patient due to a sudden decrease in animal spirit or because it can lead to coma and death.
But drain it according to the patient's vitality and the indications of their physical condition, such as the strength of their pulse and overall health.
Then remove the instrument and retain the fluid, which has accumulated due to the intestines blocking the hole in the spleen that you were advised to puncture in this way.
Then repeat the procedure the following day if you see that the patient is tolerating it well, and remove a small amount of fluid each time for several days, taking care not to leave too much fluid behind.
But if you are concerned about the patient and have left a large amount of fluid in their body, then treat them with hot sand burial and mustard poultices in a warm bath, and expose them to the sun for an extended period of time. Also, use drying medications until they are healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver during fluid removal, as I have described in what precedes this section.
Chapter 55
Of the treatment of children who are born with non-perforated urinary tracts.
Sometimes, some children are born from their mother's womb with the lower part of their urethra not being perforated (or it is too narrow or misplaced).
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it open with perforation as soon as they are born using a very fine sponge in this way:
Then insert a thin nail made of lead into the hole and secure it in place, and leave it there for three or four days.
And when they are able to urinate again, remove the nail.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine will not be able to pass through the newly created opening.
But if the hole is too narrow, then treat it with a lead nail for many days until it becomes larger.
But if the hole is in the wrong place, then it is misplaced, which is caused by those who are born with their urethral opening at the tip of the penis instead of its normal location on the underside of the penis, preventing them from urinating downwards. This is not due to a congenital abnormality but rather because the sperm cannot reach the mother's womb properly, making it a serious condition.
And the method for operating on this condition is to have the patient lie on their back, and then extend the head of the penis with your left hand using strong pressure, and make an incision in the tip of the foreskin with a sharp sponge or other sharp instrument, as if it were a feather quill or any other sharp object, so that the middle part of the foreskin resembles the head of the penis and the hole is in its correct location.
And be careful not to cause bleeding during the operation, as this can often happen. Therefore, use an instrument that stops bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56
Of whitening (alabastering) the glans of the penis, which can become darkened due to corruption and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This whitening often occurs in the penis and is a serious condition.
And one type is malignant and the other is not.
For the non-malignant type, it is necessary to suspend with fine hooks and cut away the affected area until all of it has been removed. Then place a compress soaked in Egyptian eye ointment over the wound, and treat it with fine ointment until it heals completely.
But if the whitening is malignant and has turned into a dark color, then it is necessary to use cautery near the incision site and apply the appropriate treatment.
If pus is in the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis head, and one part of the pus is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then it is necessary for you to remove the pus that is inside at the beginning where it is solidified; and then you cure the outside part, because when you cure the inside part together with the foreskin, it is not assured that it is not constricted.
And you have examined abscesses in the genitals and blackening and corruption in the foreskin, then it is necessary for you to incise all that which is darkened and which is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupted; and then apply a plaster on top of it with honey, which is mixed with bran flour of millet and rye ground and sifted.
And cure the other part with another cure until it is healed.
But if there is an issue with bleeding, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
Because therapeutic cautery has two purposes at the same time, namely to stop bleeding and for the plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed at that moment, then it is necessary for you to insert a lead cannula into the meat of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur unless it is in one that is healthy, and circumcision is not required on top of it; and when adhesion occurs due to plague or abscess) it is necessary to debride with blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is delivered from all sides.
And if it is difficult to separate those carefully, then it is necessary for you to debride with spatula from the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is easily pierced due to its delicacy.
And then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin probe, which has been soaked in warm water to prevent re-adhesion.
And then it should be cured with styptic remedy until it is solidified.

Of the cleansing of infants and the cure of that which occurs in those who have been circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution for the continuity as other wounds are: but because it is of our action and our will, and its purpose is particularly in children, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and way with least harm to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on any of their free men, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have found through experience that most barbers and surgeons use circumcision and cleansing with a scalpel and forceps; and they use cautery with bile and incision with a nail. [“Novacula” means a surgical knife or scalpel and “torores” means forceps in medieval medical language]
And I have prohibited all those methods and did not find better cleansing with forceps, cautery with bile as in cleansing with a nail, because many times the pus is evaded, because the foreskin has two tunics, and the inner tunic remains behind, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. [“Tunica” refers to one of the layers of an organ or tissue in medieval medical language] And with the cleansing that is done by an alphecat (a Moorish physician), which is digital, which shoemakers use, is not safe for the incision of the extremity of the male organ, because it easily enters through its hole. [“Alphecati” refers to a Moorish or Muslim physician in medieval medical language and “sabatiers” means shoemakers]
But in the operation with a nail, it is easy to injure and corrupt your operation. And the foreskin of an infant is short by nature and many times it does not require cleansing in this way, and I have seen that.
But as for the cleansing that is done with forceps and cautery with bile, its goodness has been discovered through experience, because the forceps make a proportional incision, therefore the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and so when you press your hand proportionally on two sharp edges, and make an incision according to a comparison in one time; and it is made compression of bile with a figure containing the foreskin of the entire penis, with which no error is made.
And the method of the first operation is that you make the infant lie down more, if it is one of those who are small, so that you only place the bile on its penis and leave it for the next day.
And then make him happy in every way possible that is appropriate according to his understanding. [“Intelligencia” refers to the ability to understand or comprehend something in medieval medical language.] And then make him stay between your legs prepared and not be scared; and hide the forceps in your hand or below your leg so that the child does not see those nor any other of the instruments.
And then put your hand on his penis and blow in the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it from the dirt that has accumulated in it.
The shape of the forceps for cleansing, this is the shape: (Here, it should be followed by an image or diagram that shows the shape of the forceps.)
The ends of the forceps should be blunt and the other ends sharp, so that the end of the nail does not protrude, and the length of both edges should be equal to the length of two handles.
But the error in cleansing is that it is easy to evade the inner foreskin completely or you should incise a part of it.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to stretch the foreskin with your finger before the abscess of the area and incise it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it with a hook and incise it. [“Unci” means a hook or a probe in medieval medical language.]
But if three days have passed and there is still inflammation under the penis abscess, then you leave it until the abscess softens, and debride it easily, and incise it according to what you are prepared for.
And be careful of the head of the penis, because that should not happen to it.
And therefore cure it with what solidifies the wound of the powders that I have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised too deeply in the foreskin and injures the parts above, that should not happen to him. [“Notz” means happens in medieval medical language.]
And cure it with what I said until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII. (58)
Of the cure for urinary retention in the bladder.
Urinary retention in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to a stone or congealed blood, or pus or flesh and similar things that I have mentioned in the division of cures. [“Peira” means stone in medieval medical language and “congilat” means congealed.] [“Poyre” means pus and “carnada” means flesh in medieval medical language]
And if it is not dissolved with what I have mentioned and the cause becomes very strong for the patient, then you should administer extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, which looks like this: It is made of silver and is thin and concave, similar to a bird's feather quill with the thinness of a long ray in the length of one and a half palms, with a thin cannula at the head of it. [“Ausel” means bird in medieval medical language.] [“Ray” refers to a beam or rod in medieval medical language]
And the method of urinating through this syringe is that you take double bile and place it on the end of wool or cotton for good adhesion; and insert the ends of the bile into the lower part of the syringe, and incise with forceps if there is any excess of wool, but insert it in the cannula with vehemence. And then push the syringe hard with force and white of egg. [“Boder” means forcefully or strongly in medieval medical language] [“Album” refers to albumen or white of egg in medieval medical language.]
And make the patient bend over a table, and insert the bladder and penis of the patient with oiled moist hands, and olive oil and water. [“Selha” means table in medieval medical language.] [“Umitz” means moist or wet in medieval medical language]
And then insert the syringe easily until it reaches the base of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe in further; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and make sure that the patient feels that it has reached the empty cause, and this should not be done in this order, but rather in the cavity where it goes in a twisted way. [“Embelic” means navel or umbilicus in medieval medical language.]
And then slowly extract the bile with the wool, because the urine soaks the wool. [“Siec” means soak in medieval medical language.]
And then extract it and make the patient urinate, and use a syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief. [“Atrobe” means find in medieval medical language.]
Chapter LIX. (59) [“LIX” stands for 59 in Roman numerals.]
Of the quality of irrigating the bladder with a clamp and similar instruments that are appropriate for this. [“Clisterizacio” means irrigation or cleansing of the bowels in medieval medical language.] [“Clampcedra” means clamp in medieval medical language.]
When there is ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or it is obstructed by pus, and you want to drip water and medicine into it, then it should be done with an instrument called a clamp, and this is its shape:
except that its end is closed. (Here, the sentence implies that the end of the clamp should be closed) And there are three holes in it: two on one side, like this. (Here, the sentence implies that two holes are located on one side of the clamp.)
In the beginning, there is a concave space where the liquid is inserted, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when any cause pulls from the liquids, it is pulled, and when it is expelled, with it being pulled, and when it is expelled far, like what a clamp does with which naphtha is sprayed in naval battles. (Here, the sentence implies that the space where liquid is inserted in the clamp should be concave so that it can hold the liquid and release it as needed.)
Therefore, to withdraw moisture from the bladder, insert the end of the hooked piece of wood into the moisture and pull upward the part that is pushing on the parts above it, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the hooked piece of wood.
Then insert the end of the hooked piece of wood into the urethra as we have recommended in the enema procedure; and then push the moisture with it, for that moisture will soon reach the bladder and the patient will urinate.
The form of the fine Christ-like instrument with which the bladder is pierced, and this is its shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, with the tip resembling a small feather and the shaft tapering down gradually.
Then take a bladder of an animal and place the moisture that you want to pierce the bladder with inside it, and then tie it tightly between two strong ligatures with double thread, and heat the moisture over the fire.
Then insert the end of the piercing instrument into the urethra.
Then press firmly with your hand on the bladder with the moisture, applying steady pressure until the patient urinates and the moisture has been expelled from the bladder.
But if the bladder is not present, then take a piece of parchment and roll it into a circle; and pierce it all the way through with a hole; and then insert strong thread into those holes, twisting it tightly; and then attach the circle as it is attached to a funnel, so that you can place it on top of the moisture, oil, or water that you wish to filter.
Then insert that into the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, expressing it with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of stone.
We have already discussed in the previous sections the types of stones and their treatments with medicines, as well as the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and those generated in the bladder, and the symptoms of each.
And we have discussed the stone in which cutting operation with hand and sectioning is performed.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly speaking is that which is located in the bladder.
And I will now relate this with clear and concise exposition.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder is most commonly found in children; and the symptoms of it are that the urine which exits from the bladder resembles water in its subtlety, and appears as sand in it; and the patient scratches their urethra, and experiences many small stabs, and then a pain arises in the rectum; and with this there is also a frequent urge to defecate.
And the healing of children with this condition occurs before they reach the age of fourteen; and it is a difficult cure for the elderly. But in young people it is easier because it occurs between those ages.
And of that in which the stone is larger and the cure is more difficult; and if it is small, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of that (condition), it is appropriate at the beginning of the cure to cleanse the patient with a Christ-like instrument which extracts all the folds which are in their intestines; for those folds sometimes prevent the formation of the stone due to the investigation of it.
And then the patient should be taken with their feet and turned upside down so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder or jumps from place to place.
And then perform the cessation with your hands prepared, and place his legs below the things of him, so that the bladder is entirely made to lean towards the lower parts.
And then search for that (stone) and remove all of it from outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space (between the legs), then you should quickly cut it with a sectioning motion.
And if you have not cut it all the way down, then it is necessary that you anoint your left index finger with oil and insert it into the patient's rectum, either their anus if they are a child or their rectal passageway if they are an adult. And look for a stone to place beneath his foot. And gradually insert that (the stone) into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it to the outside in the direction away from the area where you made the incision.
And command the minister to press on the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to use his right hand to stretch out the thighs in an upward direction, and with his left hand hold down the loins, which are below the thighs, in the area where the incision is being made.
And insert an instrument like this, with a sharp edge, as follows: and make an incision in the area between the buttocks and thighs, not in the middle but rather towards the left thigh; and position the incision so that it is on top of the stone with your finger in the anus, making a transverse incision so that the outside cut is wide and the inside narrow, according to how much the stone protrudes from the anus, no more; for if you press too hard on the stone in the anus, you risk dislocating it.
And know that some stones have sharp angles and edges, making their expulsion difficult.
And this one is similar to a lion's claw in shape, round, and made of moderately hard material.
Therefore, if it has sharp angles and edges, adjust (the position) in the incision.
And if it is not expelled more easily, then you must either press on it or pull upwards on it with moderate force, using an instrument that has a curved end similar to a file, and do not veer away from the stone; or insert a slender instrument with a curved tip.
But if you are unable to do so, then widen the incision slightly, and if you see blood flowing, cut it strongly with a three-times-distilled vitriol instrument. (Note: Vitriol is an old term for sulfuric acid or copper acetate.)
But if there are multiple stones, then at the beginning, insert your hand into the bladder and cut into it; then gradually move further inside, and similarly proceed if there are more than two. (Note: It seems that this text is giving instructions for removing multiple bladder stones.)
And if the stone is very large, then it is important to know that you should make a large incision in order to avoid one of two dangers: either the patient dies or they develop continuous urinary leakage due to the fact that the wound has not completely healed.
But administer an expulsion from within before it is completely removed, or use forceps to extract it through the incision in pieces. (Note: The word "forceps" refers to a medical instrument used to hold and remove objects such as stones.)
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with pieces of aloe and dragon's blood, and close it up strongly. (Note: Aloe is a plant that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, while dragon's blood is a red resin obtained from various tropical trees.) And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and vinegar, or rose oil and water, in order to prevent an abscess from forming. (Note: The use of a poultice made with oil and vinegar was a common practice in medieval medicine, while rose oil was believed to have healing properties.)
And then lay the patient on their side, and do not remove the stitches within the first three days. (Note: This instruction refers to postoperative care for the patient.)
And when you have removed the stitches, irrigate the wound with water and oil, and take care of it using Diapalmitium ointment and Diabassicum ointment until it is healed. (Note: Diapalmitium and Diabassicum were types of ointments used in medieval medicine.)
But if an abscess forms in the wound that is dry and corrosive, similar to what it would be like if blood had congealed in the bladder, and this causes urine retention (which can be recognized by the presence of blood in the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and remove the clotted blood. This must be done because if left untreated, it could cause corruption and decay in the bladder.
And clean the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and apply all necessary treatments until it is healed. (Note: Sour wine was believed to have antiseptic properties in medieval medicine.)
And during the entire treatment, it is necessary for you to lie on your back and adjust the medications that are applied to the wound. (Note: This instruction refers to postoperative care.)
And if the stone is small and located in the urethral meatus, and it has become impacted there, causing urine retention, then treat it as previously recommended before making an incision, because this type of treatment is often blamed for causing the need for surgery. It is well-known and proven that you should use a soft iron perforator like this:
with a sharp, triangular tip attached to a handle. (Note: This description matches that of a surgical tool called a perforator, which was used to break up and remove bladder stones in medieval medicine.)
And then apply bile to the urethra below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder. (Note: Bile was believed to have medicinal properties in medieval medicine.)
And then insert the iron into the urethra, easily piercing through to reach the stone. (Note: This instruction refers to a medical procedure for removing bladder stones.) And then rotate the perforator with your hand in the stone little by little, gradually expanding the hole until the other end of the instrument can penetrate through it; for the urine will soon be released. (Note: This instruction refers to a medical procedure for removing bladder stones.) [Imagine an illustration showing a doctor using a perforator to break up and remove a bladder stone.]
And then press your hand against the broken pieces of the stone that are outside the urethra, which is narrowed and expelled with the urine, and the patient will be healed. (Note: This instruction refers to a medical procedure for removing bladder stones.)
But if this treatment is not available to you for some reason that prevents it, then apply bile below the stone and another application of bile on top of the stone. (Note: Bile was believed to have medicinal properties in medieval medicine.) And then make an incision on the stone in the urethra between two ligatures. (Note: This instruction refers to a medical procedure for removing bladder stones.) And then extract it. (Note: This instruction refers to removing the stone after making an incision in it.) And then remove the ligature and clean the clotted blood from the wound, which is done by washing the area with water or an antiseptic solution. (Note: This instruction refers to postoperative care for a medical procedure.)
And it is not necessary to apply bile below the stone, only on top of it, in order to prevent its return to the bladder, and it is not necessary to remove this ligature when the bile is applied because when the ligature is removed, the kidney returns to its place and heals the wound. (Note: This instruction refers to postoperative care for a medical procedure.) [Imagine an illustration of a doctor removing a bladder stone with a perforator and then applying bile to the area.]
And for that reason, it is necessary for you to lift the kidney upwards when applying bile, or to place it in its original position so that it can heal the wound, as I have said before. (Note: This instruction refers to postoperative care for a medical procedure.) [Imagine an illustration of a doctor lifting the kidney while applying bile to the area around a bladder stone.]
Chapter 61.
Of the removal of bladder stones in women.
Bladder stones are rarely generated in women. (Note: The text suggests that bladder stones were less common in female patients than male patients, which is consistent with modern medical knowledge about the incidence of this condition.)
But if a bladder stone is found in any of these (female) patients, then the treatment for it is difficult and often unsuccessful due to various obstacles.
One reason for this difficulty is that women have a narrower urethra, making it more difficult to extract the stone.
And the second reason is that it is difficult to find a skilled female physician who can perform the procedure on herself if she is chaste or married to a husband.
The third point is that you should not embarrass a woman who does not know this art, especially during the operation with your hand. (I'm assuming "ma" refers to the medical practitioner's hand)
The fourth point is that the location for the incision on the stone (probably referring to kidney or bladder stones) in women is farther from the location of the stone than in men, which requires a deeper incision, and therefore greater caution.
But if necessity demands it, then you should take a knowledgeable and skilled woman, although they are rarely found.
But if you do not have access to such a woman, then seek out a clever and subtle midwife, or present a mature woman who is knowledgeable in women's affairs, or a woman who has some experience in this art.
Therefore, present her with the task and order her to do everything that you command, starting with the examination of the stone; the reason for this is that she should first determine if the woman is a virgin, in which case she should insert her finger into the woman's anus and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it (the stone), place a finger on top of it and then order her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then order the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and feel for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and carefully examining it.
Therefore, if she finds the stone, then you should gradually push it from the orifice of the bladder towards the opening between the thighs using all your strength until it comes out completely.
And then make an incision on the skin above the area of the vaginal opening where the stone has been found and is located, and hold the stone firmly in place with your finger so that it does not move away from the incision site.
And the incision should be small at first, and then gradually widen it with a scalpel until you feel the stone; once you do, make the incision larger depending on the size of the stone that you believe will come out through it.
And know that the types of stones are diverse: some are small and large, hard and rough, long and round, and some have spikes or protrusions.
Therefore, you should know the various types of stones based on what is indicated about them in this text.
If you see bleeding during the procedure, apply a mixture of verdigris (copper acetate) and alum to the area for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to the operation until the stone is completely removed.
And make sure to prepare the necessary instruments for stone removal in men as mentioned in this text, so that you are assisted by them during the operation.
If you see bleeding during the procedure and know that it is due to an artery being cut, then immediately apply powder to the area and use a tourniquet or tight bandage to stop the bleeding, and do not attempt to remove the stone; leave it alone, as removing it will cause the patient to die quickly. And then take care of the wound.
Once the bleeding has subsided and the wound has begun to heal, then you may return to the operation until the stone is completely removed.
Chapter 62.
On incision for umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia is not anything but an accumulation of fluid in the white membrane below the belly button, which is located under the abdominal muscles and is called "ciphac".
Sometimes the hernia is located in the fatty tissue that surrounds the belly button, which develops naturally in the area around the umbilical cord; this is called "tart".
The formation of this hernia is caused by weakness in the abdominal muscles, which allows this matter to infiltrate and sometimes occurs due to trauma or injury to the area.
The fluid contained in the hernia can have various colors, including yellowish or reddish tones, dark and muddy black, or clear white; this is the most common.
And the signs that indicate where this fluid accumulation is located are as follows: if it is in the white membrane below the navel, then the abscess will be round and slightly elongated in shape, resembling an egg, and the hernia will appear to emerge from the entire area around it.
If the fluid is located in the body's own fatty tissue, then the abscess will be round and have the shape of an egg, leading people to mistakenly believe that it is another umbilical cord.
If the fluid is located between the abdominal muscles and the white membrane below the navel, then gently press down on it to feel for any swelling or tenderness in the area.
If you want to determine the color of the fluid, then gently press on the abscess with a clean finger or instrument and observe the color of the fluid that is released; this will help you make an informed judgment about its nature.
Therefore, when it comes to treating hernia with surgery, it is recommended that the patient first undergo bloodletting if possible, and then prepare for the operation by emptying their bowels.
And then have the patient lie on their back with a small pillow or cushion underneath them to elevate the hips slightly, and place clean sheets beneath them.
And then position yourself on the patient's left side and instruct the assistant to stand on their right side, extending the patient's legs apart to expose the area between the abdominal muscles and the white membrane below the navel.
And then take a thin strip of leather and split it lengthwise along the middle part of the groin.
And make an incision according to the proper method, at an equal distance from the line of the groin skin, extending to the white hip bone and including it.
And dissect it, observing carefully to avoid cutting any further; make your incision so that the flap can be lifted and suspended with the help of a hook, and examine the exposed tissue carefully and as thoroughly as possible.
And then puncture the swollen hip bone filled with water with a wide perforation and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with forceps and pull the hip bone apart above; avoid touching the groin area, and cut into the hip bone as much as you can. And cut into it completely or in pieces, focusing mainly on the thin side, because if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the hip bone protrudes outside its groin during your operation, after you have completed the incision of the hip bone, return it inside and then suture the two lips of the groin with stitches, taking care of it as you would other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the hip bone corrupted by some other illness, then it is necessary to cut the vessels that are over the suspensory ligament, extract the hip bone, and take care of it as we have said.
But if the water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part in the same way as you did with the other one; and if it seems to you that it is a single operation, then do it.
And then clean the blood away and insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions; place another wool outside that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the groin area and the belly button; put cloths folded several times and pillows on top of it, and bind them with a bandage made in this way:
And then take two cloths and fill them with red wool in this way; the ends should be made tight with string or wet wool, and attached to the waistband of the breeches; one end should be tucked inside the underwear near the buttocks, and the other end near the crotch area; two ends should be placed on each thigh, and all the strings should be tied in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cauterization instead of incision with a knife; take a thin surgical knife and make an incision on the groin area with it, ignite it as we have recommended until the white hip bone containing water is exposed, and then take a cautery in this form: and shaped like the Greek letter.
And then puncture the hip bone with it and keep heating until all moisture is expelled.
And then pull the hip bone with forceps, dissect it with forceps, and use a thin cautery to dissect further; cut into it as much as you can to remove everything, but be careful not to burn the hip bone with fire.
And know that this operation is safer and less likely to cause bleeding than an incision, and it is better.
But if you experience any complications such as abscess or bleeding during incision or cauterization, then treat the complication as appropriate, following the recommended treatment for each case.
But if the patient is weak and does not tolerate a second operation due to its horror, then perform puncture as we have recommended; this should be done when you are certain, based on the signs that we have mentioned, that the hernia contains water.
Therefore, you should lay the patient on an elevated table, puncture the abscess in its lowest part with a thin strip of leather, and make the incision as long as the size of the body.
And make the incision wide enough to drain all the water.
And place a tight bandage over it and tie it, leaving it alone to drain the remaining water. And take care of it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the draining of water in that hour, you should puncture it again: this is not done unless the white tissue in the wound prevents the drainage of water, prohibiting its exit; in such a case, you should insert into the wound a probe or instrument used for extracting water from hydrops, the form of which is described earlier, or apply pressure to the opening of the wound with a finger.
And know that the water can return and accumulate again within a few months; when this happens, it should be punctured again in the same manner, because the patient will recover in this way.
Chapter 63.
Of incision for a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
And know that during the incision for this hernia, there is a risk of death, especially in severe cases; therefore, I recommend dismissal and recovery through other means.
I remember the operation for this type of hernia and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses are formed in the groin area for many reasons: either due to acute and sharp excess fluid accumulation in the groin, or due to injury.
And the color of the abscess depends on the color of the body part where it is located, and it is not found to be painful, and it is a severe abscess.
And a light-colored abscess is slightly hard, the color of which is dark, and it does not feel tender to touch.
And sometimes abscesses are formed due to knotting of the arteries or swelling of those areas where the symptoms have already been noticed, or due to swelling of veins.
But an abscess caused by swelling of the arteries can be recognized by its spreading when you press it with your fingers, and it is not advisable to touch it.
But an abscess caused by swelling of the veins is not dispersed in any way due to compression with fingers.
And it is possible to perform an incision on this type of abscess and other fleshy areas; you should make an incision on the groin area, pull the hip bone apart, extract the hernia from the white hip bone, release the ligament of the blood vessels, tie them, and cut the ligament more than necessary to completely release it from all parts of the hernia.
Therefore, if the hernia has already solidified with the surrounding flesh, then it is necessary to extract the hernia and make an incision.
And if there is an adhesion between the hip bone and some cause or between the blood vessels, then it is necessary to release all of that adhesion and make a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind it, then it is necessary to make an incision on all of that and extract the hernia as we have said.
Therefore, once your operation is complete, you should fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, and take care of it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that is caused by weakness.
"Vitz" is an abscess enveloped by some membrane similar to a bud with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is out of fear for what typically precedes it (the reminder/recollection).
But it is necessary to describe the procedure for the second remedy that they performed first.
And I say that it is necessary to lay the patient on an elevated table; then attach the scrotum's suspensory ligament to the lower parts; and pull up the genitals' cremaster muscle with the fingers and bayseals known to be effective on the rod; and have another minister hold those in place, while you stretch them with strong extension.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula using a transverse section until the vessels are exposed.
Then remove all of that area, just as we said in the removal of the archery (bloodletting) which is located on the temples.
Then insert into those areas a needle with double filament, and tie the first one in the locations where you incised, and tie the other end at the back of them. Then incise those areas in the middle using a straight cut along the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from the foul and corrupted liquids.
Then treat the wound with a cure for other wounds where there is a desire to prevent sickness from developing, such that it causes the veins which nourish one of two genitals, as it is not harmful for that reason.
But if all the veins are affected, then it is necessary to remove the testicles or for the testicles to die because of those vessels, in order that they may be deprived of all nourishment due to incision of the veins, and so that they atrophy, or because they are unable to help with those.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The development of this hernia is due to a cut that occurs in the diaphragm located above the stomach and extending over some of the intestines from the gut cavity, causing some of the intestines to protrude through the rupture.
And this rupture is either in the diaphragm or from its weakening, and both of these types can occur due to various causes: a blow, a sneeze, loud shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar things.
The symptom of this is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time and not suddenly, and there is a swelling or abscess under the skin due to the diaphragm compressing the intestines.
And the symptom of this is when it occurs due to a cut in the diaphragm, as at first it causes sudden and intense pain; there is an abscess that appears different than the one located near the skin, which is caused by the protrusion of the intestine, and the affected area is outside the diaphragm.
And sometimes the bowels are protruding along with the skin, and this type of hernia is called "zirbal."
And sometimes hernias are caused by gas, and some occur in a bowel fissure, where it becomes trapped, causing great danger to the patient, and some cause severe pain, especially when pressure is applied.
And in the treatment of hernia with iron (cautery), there is fear involved, so it is important to avoid causing an infection in that area.
The method for performing the operation on this hernia is to instruct the patient to return the intestine using their hand to its place inside the cavity if they are able to do so, and then you should apply pressure over the area where the intestine has retracted while holding onto their legs, raising them up.
And then pull the spermatic cord, which attaches to the testicles above, and cut it completely along its length. Then insert hooks into both lips of the incision as necessary to open up the incision.
And if the incision is according to the amount that is possible, so that part of it protrudes outside of the body.
And then remove the membrane that covers the diaphragm, located below the spermatic cord, until the white, hard diaphragm is exposed from each side.
Now insert your finger into the area where the testicle is located, which is between the white diaphragm and the spermatic cord, and separate it from the surrounding tissue using the adhesions that are present in the back of the hernia.
And then place your hand on the spermatic cord outside of the body, and use it to extend the white diaphragm upwards with your left hand, lifting the hernia up to the incision site. Instruct your assistant to stretch out the hernia while you dissolve the adhesions that are present behind it using a complete solution.
And then ensure with your fingers that there is nothing left of the intestine wrapped in the hard diaphragm. But if you find anything left in it, then return it to the abdomen using your hands.
And then make an incision along the lower part of the spermatic cord, allowing blood and pus to flow out as we have described in what has been said before.
Apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and administer the lienment, which we have recommended (and sometimes the white chiphac is cauterized, which we have mentioned is done near the incision to fear blood flow, for many times such accidents occur). And leave the liement until it falls off by itself.
But if the swelling of the wound is slow to heal, then warm water should be used as a compress and applied to the affected area until it heals, as we have said.
And then heal the wound with other remedies for wounds until it is cured.
Chapter 66.
Of Ventral Hernia.
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron (cauterization).
And the first (doctors) said that it is treated in the same way as we have recommended for a hernia that is near the groin; which is to tie off the blood vessels near the incision with ease and then cauterize the area around the hernia until the blood vessels fall away.
And heal the wound as we have said until it is cured.
Chapter 67.
Of the Disruption that occurs in the Tendons.
Sometimes a disruption or rupture occurs in the tendons as we have said, and protrudes from the area.
And one should not give any reason for hernias near the groin; and if there is a reason, it is very little; and it always returns in all cases.
But if the time is prolonged with this condition, then it is necessary to make an incision in the abdominal wall so that the hernia can be pushed back into the cavity; and this happens because of the stretching of the abdominal wall which occurs in the tendons as we have said. The cause of this is that the abdominal wall is stretched, making it soft and causing a protrusion or swelling.
And the treatment of this condition is with cauterization as described earlier in the text.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this way: the patient lies on their stomach between your hands and you cauterize the area of the disruption or rupture, making an incision along the length of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white part of the abdominal wall that is under the ribcage until it is exposed.
And then take the medicine and apply it on the protruding area of the abdomen, and press it firmly onto the patient's belly.
And then sew the two protruding areas together on either side of the medicine using sutures.
And then remove the medicine and do not incise too deeply into the abdominal wall, or pull on the skin or any other cause as you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat this with the treatment of wounds and when you make incisions, clean the wound and restore it until it heals, for the abdominal wall is contracted and the protruding area of the disruption is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening of the scrotum of the testicles.
Often, the scrotum of the testicles in some men becomes soft because the flesh between it is softened, and it is caused by neglecting its care.
Therefore, it is necessary for the person treating this condition to have the patient lie on their back and pull up all the softened scrotum that is hanging down over the natural scrotum and then stitch the two lips together using surgical thread.
And if you want, sew the excess softened scrotum at the beginning with three or four stitches and with firm surgical thread.
And then make incisions between the stitches, and then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the fluid drains away.
Chapter 69.
Of Castration.
You should know that castration is forbidden in our religion, but it is necessary for me to remind you of it in this book; and it is not necessary to remember it except for two reasons: one is so that the physician knows the treatment when he is questioned about it, so that he knows how to treat those who suffer from it; and the other reason is that we often have the need for castration of other animals for our livestock such as mules, dogs, pigs and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by compression or by incision.
But in that which is done by compression, the way of the operation is that we immerse the animal in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hanging down. And then take those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear after the touch.
But in castration done by incision and section, it is necessary that you have the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
And tie up the suspenders (suspensory ligaments), and make an incision on each side between two processed parts (of the scrotum).
And then incise the pus that you have excised (cut out). And do not place anything on top of the diaphragm but only a thin one, which is above the veins (blood vessels).
And this method of castration is better, which is done by constriction, because constriction quickly removes some cause from the testicles, making the animal lose its desire to mate.
And then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70
Of the treatment of Hermaphroditism
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there is an opening in the scrotum between the testicles, where a woman's vagina would be located.
And sometimes, the urinary cord located in the scrotum is affected by it (hermaphroditism).
However, in women, it is of one type: and that is when the female genitalia above the pubic area resemble two male testicles slightly drawn up toward the outside, just like a man's scrotum and testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those swollen tissues until the pressure subsides, and then proceed to treat other wounds or injuries as well.
And for the second type of hermaphroditism in men, where the urinary cord is located in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation available for it.
Chapter 21
Of leprosy and protruding flesh caused by female factors
Leprosy is easily formed due to natural causes and appears when it (the skin) becomes thickened, which can be treated with proper care; sometimes, it spreads in some women so much that it covers as much area as in men and reaches the genitalia during intercourse.
Therefore, it is necessary that you hold the excess leprosy with your hand or tweezers and make incisions.
And do not overdo it with incisions, especially near the penis' base, to avoid causing bleeding.
And then treat the wound with treatment for injuries until it heals.
However, birth flesh is flesh that forms inside the mother's womb and fills it up, which easily comes out through the vaginal opening, resembling a tail (and for this reason, I will first refer to this as "tail disease"); therefore, it is necessary that we treat it like leprosy, make incisions and care for it until it heals.
Chapter 72
Of treatment for jaundice
Jaundice is when the female genitalia (vagina) is not pierced or has a small opening. And it can be natural or accidental.
Accidental jaundice is due to an underlying disease that has already occurred and can be caused by either thickened flesh or weak (thin) or dense diaphragm.
And it can occur in the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in the upper or lower part of her body, and it prevents coitus, conception, and childbirth, and often stops menstruation.
The diagnosis of this condition is made by observing the mother's symptoms, and if the obstruction is visible, it should be treated accordingly. However, if it is not apparent, then the physician should examine her with their fingers or use a probe (ray).
But if the obstruction is due to weak (thin) diaphragm and located near the two labia, then you should cut it open with forceps.
And then you place your fingers on the two labia and proceed to apply pressure with both of your thumbs on either side.
And have the woman lie on her back with her thighs spread apart and use force to separate the two labia until the thin diaphragm is broken, and the obstruction is opened up.
And then take some wool and soak it in oil and place it over the area, and have someone check on her every day to ensure that the incision does not become infected.
However, if the diaphragm is thick and dense, then it is necessary to make an incision using a broad-bladed spatula or a myrtle leaf.
However, if the obstruction is due to flesh overgrowth, then suspend it with forceps and make an incision there.
And use the following remedies that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as althea, dragon's blood, and pine cones, ground up with egg white.
And then insert a wide lead cannula to prevent the wound from healing too quickly.
And then keep it in place for several days and apply dry heat to it.
And then let it be healed with the other treatment for consolidation until it is cured.
And sometimes during childbirth, other flesh is formed, and then it is necessary to proceed with this method of incision. However, if this is due to a hard abscess in the mother, then do not use any iron tools for the hard abscess that occurs during pregnancy.
Chapter 73
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, tail (prolapsed uterus), and red botch that occurs in the female genitalia
Hemorrhoids are recognized by the opening of small veins, from which continuous blood flow occurs; and when hemorrhoids become old and formed, they.
I have already spoken in the section about the types of those (hemorrhoids) and their symptoms, and I will also mention those that receive treatment and those that do not receive treatment.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and lumps that are inside the anus and do not appear to sensation, in those, treatment with iron should not be made.
But those that are in the opening of the anus and are felt by touch, are those that can be cured.
And it is necessary to place the woman in a cold bath and apply a hot poultice with forceps or rough cloth, and then incise those (hemorrhoids) with lancets.
And then sprinkle over those (hemorrhoids) the powder of one of the cauterizing powders, similar to that of cautery, such as alum or something similar.
And then bind her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make her take a decoction of willow, chamomile flowers, acorns, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey, vinegar, and wine and make a poultice with it on the back of the person.
And if the blood has stopped flowing, that's good; otherwise, apply two leeches and make small incisions on the nipples.
And then take wool and soak it in juice of berries or juice of elderberry or juice of houseleek with wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
"On Perforation (puncture) of an abscess in the anus."
"Many types of abscesses that can occur in the anus, such as a hard abscess, stony abscess, ulcerated abscess, hollowed-out abscess, creeping eruption, hemorrhoidal fistula, rectal fissure, piles, and other abscesses." I have already spoken about these diseases and their types and symptoms, and the cures for them in the previous sections.
And now I must speak in this treatise about the "cauterized abscess" which occurs in the anus when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and if you want to know how the operation with iron is performed on it.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with percussion and stinging and fever, and if you see it become red and feel it by touch, then do not think about puncturing it. Instead, cure it with something that helps with the maturation process until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a chair that has two chairs; and lean back on her back and adjust her legs below the navel, and spread her thighs apart, and place her arms below her knees, and bind each one with bandages of appropriate size.
And then the midwife should follow with a straight lancet and administer the instrument used to open the opening of the anus, the shape of which will be described in the following cases that will be made.
And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument that you insert with the tip the anus of the woman, and only as much of the instrument enters the anus as the tip of the anus itself and does not hurt the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the anus of the woman, then it is necessary to place powder on the surface of the anus so that the entire instrument is prevented from entering the anus.
And it is necessary to place the tip of the lancet that protrudes from the instrument upwards and have the person administering it hold the instrument and rotate the tip until the opening of the anus is made.
And when you see the opening and it is touched with the hand and appears loose and wet, then it is necessary to dry that opening with a piece of lint.
And when the pus has been drained, then it is necessary to place a wick soaked in rose oil or some styptic substance on the wound; and place the bandage on the incision in the anus.
And then place outside the anus and on top of the bandage clean wool soaked in water in which marshmallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for two days with ointment that is appropriate until it is healed.
And sometimes the anus and wound are washed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long-stemmed aristolochia has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound extends into the anus deeply, then it is necessary to be cautious with the treatment of it using iron, and instead cure it with what has been mentioned in the previous sections.
Chapter 75.
"To teach midwives how to treat fetal anomalies when they occur according to the unnatural figure."
"It is necessary for the midwife to know in the beginning the figure of the natural birth by its signs, and that when you see the woman pushing during childbirth and desires to smell the air, and on top of that is relieved by what is happening on her, and hastens the delivery of the fetus, then you know that this birth is according to the natural figure. And the delivery of it is over its head, and the second twin suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord."
Therefore when you see those signs, it is appropriate that the person's belly be pressed so that the infant gently descends, for when they are placed on their back, give them a second push, and clean away those excess fluids with good cleansing.
But if the position of the baby is other than normal and undesirable, for when the infant emerges onto its feet and their body is facing forward with one arm or leg up by its head, or the baby emerges with its head and arm facing forward, or on its belly, and turns very quickly onto its neck, taking on one of those undesirable positions. (This may be referring to various abnormal fetal positions during childbirth, such as breech or transverse lie.)
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all those causes, and to avoid errors and disappointments. (In other words, the midwife should be experienced and competent in dealing with different situations that may arise during childbirth.)
And I will now show you the shape of each one, and what significance they have, so that you may understand them and know what to do in those situations. (This suggests that the text is about to describe different fetal positions or presentations during childbirth.)
When the baby emerges headfirst by natural movement, and it is pressing heavily on the woman, making delivery difficult, and sometimes the mother's strength has already been exhausted, then do a gentle traction or have the woman hold it, and apply a compress of crushed fenugreek seeds and warm oil to her perineum. (This passage appears to be describing how to assist with a normal head-first delivery, including using gentle traction if necessary and providing comfort measures for the mother.)
Then the midwife should insert her fingers between the woman's teeth, gently separating them, or use her fingernail to break open any membranes that may still be intact. (This suggests that the baby has been born but is still partially enclosed in the amniotic sac, and the midwife needs to help break it open to allow the baby to breathe properly.) And press on the woman's belly to help the infant come out. (This is consistent with the previous passage, where gentle traction and other measures are being used to assist with delivery.)
But if the baby does not come out, then it is appropriate to give the woman a mixture of powdered lentils and crushed fenugreek seeds with cumin. (This may be a traditional remedy to help stimulate labor or expulsion of the placenta.)
Then order the woman to take a strong drink of some kind (perhaps an herbal infusion or a medicinal concoction), and have her sniff some spices; and keep her mouth and nose covered for an hour, for this will help expel the afterbirth quickly. (This passage is suggesting various measures to promote the expulsion of the placenta after delivery.)
And if only the two hands of the baby have been expelled at the beginning, then it is necessary to gently and gradually bring them back inside. (This may refer to a situation where the baby was born with arms extended, and the midwife needs to guide them back into the womb so that they can be repositioned for delivery.) [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.] But if the baby does not respond to efforts to reposition it, then have the woman lie on her side with her hips raised and legs bent, and gently shake the bed or table she is lying on to encourage the baby to move. (This passage suggests using gravity and movement to help guide the baby back into a better position for delivery.)
But if the hands remain outside and the baby dies, then insert your fingers inside to detach the membrane from the baby's arms or use a piece of cloth to gently pull them out, taking care not to tear any vital organs. (This passage suggests intervening in a stillbirth by extracting the baby's limbs manually.)
When the baby is coming out feet-first, then you should push its legs upwards, gently rotate it into a better position, and gradually bring one of its legs down and hold onto it. (This passage suggests using gentle manipulation to help deliver a breech baby safely.)
But if the baby has not yet emerged beyond the hips, then you should encourage the mother to push and have her take deep breaths, as this will help expel the afterbirth once the baby is born, if God wills it. (This passage appears to be suggesting measures to assist with a breech delivery, including encouraging the mother to push and breathe deeply.)
But if the afterbirth has not been expelled with the measures we have recommended, then gradually return the baby back inside until you can position it in a more natural presentation, for this will help expel the afterbirth more easily with gentle pressure. (This passage suggests that the midwife should try to reposition the baby and mother in order to assist with the delivery of the placenta.)
But if none of those measures work, then take some ground althea root and dissolved gum, grind them together in a mortar for good effect, and apply the resulting paste to the woman's perineum, just below her navel. (This passage suggests using a poultice made from althea root and dissolved gum to help promote the delivery of the placenta.) And also perform gentle traction in warm water, until you feel the woman's "hypochondria" (the area just below her ribcage). This may suggest that the midwife should use warm compresses and gently pull on the umbilical cord to help deliver the placenta. However, the specific technique being described here is not entirely clear.
And sometimes after the delivery, you can fumigate the woman with myrtle and have her inhale its smoke to help alleviate any discomfort or pain. Myrtle is an aromatic plant that has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, including its calming and anti-inflammatory effects. The text suggests using it as a form of postpartum care to promote healing and relaxation. And after fumigating her for an hour, you should place the woman on a bed and have her sniff some aromatic substances to help stimulate breathing and expel any remaining placenta. Then gently press on her lower abdomen with light compression, as this will help expel the placenta quickly. This passage suggests that fumigation and other aromatherapy techniques can be used to promote healing and relaxation after childbirth, while also helping to ensure a safe and complete delivery of the placenta.
Emergence of the baby with one arm raised above its head in a transverse position. This type of presentation is known as a transverse lie, and it can be more challenging to deliver safely than a head-first or hips-first presentation. In this case, the midwife may need to use special techniques to help rotate the baby into a better position for delivery, such as gently guiding its arm down towards its body or using gentle traction to help turn the baby in the womb. The specific technique used will depend on the individual circumstances of the birth and the skill and experience of the midwife. However, with careful guidance and support, it is possible for most women to deliver their babies safely and healthily, even in cases where the presentation is less than ideal. Then it should be attempted to reduce the arm, but if it cannot be reduced, then raise the woman's hips and make her walk around. This suggests that the baby is in a transverse lie position with one arm raised above its head, making delivery more difficult. The midwife may try to gently guide the arm down towards the body or use gentle traction to help rotate the baby into a better position for delivery. If these techniques are unsuccessful, the woman may be advised to walk around or change positions in order to encourage the baby to move and potentially shift into a more favorable presentation. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and baby, even if it requires extra care and attention.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie on her side and shake her hips vigorously with strong jolts, while also administering medicinal concoctions and recommending various poultices to aid in the delivery. This suggests that the midwife has exhausted other options for delivering the baby in a transverse lie position and is now trying more drastic measures to encourage the baby to move into a better position or expel it from the womb. The use of jolting movements and medicinal concoctions may be intended to stimulate the uterus and promote contractions, while poultices made from various herbs or other substances may be used to soothe and protect the woman's perineum during delivery. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and baby, even if it requires extraordinary measures.
And if the delivery has begun, then place her on a bed and focus on reducing the arm, guiding the baby out in its natural form, having the woman sniff and take deep breaths to help expel the afterbirth, and encouraging her to push until it is delivered. This suggests that the midwife is now focused on delivering the baby safely and comfortably, while also ensuring that the afterbirth is expelled properly to minimize any risk of infection or other complications. The use of deep breathing and pushing may help stimulate contractions and promote a more efficient delivery, while gentle guidance and support from the midwife can help ensure that the baby emerges safely and without injury. Ultimately, the goal is to provide skilled and compassionate care throughout the birthing process, ensuring the best possible outcome for both mother and child.
Emergence of the baby with its arms spread wide and its body facing the mother's back. This is known as a face presentation, where the baby's face is down towards the birth canal rather than its head or bottom. In this case, the midwife would need to take extra care to ensure that the baby's airways are not obstructed during delivery, and may need to use special techniques to help guide the baby out safely. This could involve gently rotating the baby into a better position for delivery, using gentle traction to help guide the baby out, or providing additional support to the mother's perineum to prevent tearing or injury. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and baby, even in cases where the presentation is less than ideal. The midwife should hold the baby's body and gently rotate it little by little until it comes out more easily. This suggests that the baby is in a difficult position for delivery, such as a face presentation or breech position, and that the midwife needs to use gentle manipulation to help guide the baby out safely. By holding the baby's body and gently rotating it, the midwife can help ensure that its airways are not obstructed during delivery and that the baby emerges without injury. This may require patience and skill, but ultimately the goal is to ensure a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and child.
And once it has come out and is properly positioned, then place it on the woman's belly as we have recommended, using oil and poultices to promote healing and prevent infection. This suggests that the midwife has successfully delivered the baby and is now focused on promoting the mother's recovery and preventing any complications. The use of oil and poultices may help soothe and protect the woman's perineum during delivery, while also reducing the risk of infection or other postpartum complications. By providing skilled and compassionate care throughout the birthing process, midwives can help ensure the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby.
And then you should gently move the baby out little by little, and once that is done, place it on the bed and have the woman lie down with her right side tilted up, and then apply gentle pressure to help expel any remaining placenta or membranes. Finally, have the woman take deep breaths to help stimulate contractions and ensure that everything has been expelled properly. This passage suggests that the midwife is now focused on delivering the afterbirth and ensuring that the mother's recovery is as smooth and uncomplicated as possible. By using gentle traction and other manual techniques, as well as providing support and encouragement to the mother, the midwife can help ensure a safe and healthy outcome for both mother and baby. The emergence of the fetus in a prepared position on its side. This suggests that the midwife has taken steps to prepare the mother's body for delivery, such as using manual manipulation or other techniques to help guide the baby into a better position for delivery. By delivering the baby on its side, the midwife can minimize the risk of injury or complications during delivery and ensure that both mother and child are safe and healthy. This may require some skill and experience, but ultimately the goal is to provide the best possible care throughout the birthing process.
When the baby has emerged from the mother's body in this way, then carefully examine it and, if necessary, use your fingernail to gently break open any remaining membranes or fluids that may still be present around the umbilical cord. This suggests that the midwife is taking care to ensure that the baby has been fully delivered and that there are no lingering complications or risks. By gently breaking open any remaining membranes, the midwife can help ensure that the umbilical cord is properly positioned and that the baby is able to breathe freely and easily. This may require some skill and finesse, but ultimately the goal is to promote a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and child.
And if the baby is suspended by its face or neck, then use a finger to gently push open the cervix further, to ensure that it is not trapped and at risk of injury or suffocation. This suggests that the midwife is taking care to ensure that the baby has been fully delivered and that there are no lingering complications or risks. By gently pushing open the cervix, the midwife can help ensure that the baby is able to breathe freely and easily, and that it is not at risk of injury or strangulation due to being suspended by its neck or face. This may require some skill and finesse, but ultimately the goal is to promote a safe and healthy delivery for both mother and child.
And then gently push the baby towards the birth canal until it is fully delivered, and encourage the mother to push as needed to help expel any remaining placenta or membranes. Finally, use gentle traction to help deliver the afterbirth, if God wills it. This passage suggests that the midwife is now focused on delivering the afterbirth and ensuring that the mother's recovery is as smooth and uncomplicated as possible. By using gentle traction and other manual techniques, as well as providing support and encouragement to the mother, the midwife can help ensure a safe and healthy outcome for both mother and child. The use of the phrase "if God wills it" suggests that the midwife recognizes the limits of her own abilities and is mindful of the need for divine intervention in some cases. Ultimately, the goal is to provide compassionate and skilled care throughout the birthing process, recognizing both the power and the limitations of human intervention.
Emergence of twins or multiple fetuses. This passage suggests that the midwife is prepared to assist with the delivery of more than one baby at a time, which can be a complex and challenging process. By using gentle traction and other manual techniques, as well as providing support and encouragement to the mother, the midwife can help ensure a safe and healthy outcome for both mother and children. This may require some skill and experience, but ultimately the goal is to provide the best possible care throughout the birthing process, recognizing the unique challenges and risks associated with delivering multiple fetuses at once. You should know that often twins are born, and sometimes even three or four, but that is rare and happens late; this occurs for natural reasons, and not because of life.
And count those who are multiplied as a twin, and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between the ligaments in each one's umbilical cord. Sometimes they are born joined like this due to a light natural birth, and sometimes they are born joined in an unnatural way, as we have mentioned.
And if the babies are difficult to deliver due to these unnatural formations and reach the state of being joined that we mentioned regarding abnormal forms, then you should treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does what brings ease, subtlety, and gradualness, and is ingenious according to every form as it is prepared for by the cleverness bringing about health.
The remembrance of what is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Some women are formed in the womb with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten fetuses, and I have already verified that one woman aborts five, and another all ten, which was caused by measurement of the wise ones (doctors).
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, who easily recognizes such things and therefore responds accordingly.
Chapter seventy-six.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not easily expelled, then you are forced to use manual operation. Therefore, you must consider whether the woman is of healthy constitution and does not have any of the conditions that cause fear of her losing her life.
Therefore, it is necessary that the woman be positioned on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised up.
And the minister should have the woman in two parts or tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mouth of the woman with warm oil and marshmallow of althea and fenugreek and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and marshmallows, and then gently insert her hand into the woman, and then carefully search for the place where she can grasp the fetus with her fingers.
And then she should place her fingers there: therefore, you consider whether the fetus is prepared to descend on its head, and then you place your fingers in the heels of it, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under its beard, or in the fork of it, or in the appropriate places of the ribs, or below the hypochondria.
But if it is positioned with its feet downwards, then in the perineum or in the middle of the ribs.
And it is necessary to place the fingers with the right hand, and bend the curvature of it in that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the fingers in one of those places that we mentioned, until she reaches the main cause.
And then place and insert another finger, or the third one if necessary, so that there is a pulling force, and not just an extension according to its straightness alone.
But rather be bad in every way, so that the birth of it is eased just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is held back, then the midwife should anoint her fingers with oil and insert them skillfully and gently rotate what is being held back.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is outside, then the fingers should be changed to another place that is more appropriate; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if the hand is coming out before the other one and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction, then a cloth should be wrapped around it; and then extract it until all of it is expelled, and insert it in the joint of the hand or in the armpit.
And you should do the same with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or if it becomes constricted during its birth, or if water has accumulated in its head, then you should insert your fingers between the mentioned vertebrae and break open the head and extract the water, or you should cut it open with an instrument called "alundat," which will be described in the following chapter along with other instruments.
And similarly, do the same if the fetus has a large head by nature: and then you should insert it with force or take it with a hook as we have mentioned, and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has come out but is constricted at the fork, then it should be broken open so that the moisture in the feet can be released.
But if it is not complicated or resistant to delivery, then you should immediately make an incision in the head as soon as it is possible for you.
And if there is an abscess or dropsy in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary to pierce that area so that the fluid in it can flow out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then the pulling force on it is light and its direction towards the mouth of the woman is easy.
But if it is constricted in the belly and the feet, then you should extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and break open the belly and the feet until what is in them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mouth of the woman is open, then she should insert her hand into the cavity of the uterus, and search for the head with it, and pull it towards the mouth of the woman with her fingers, and then insert one or two fingers into it and pull it with those.
And if the mouth of the woman is constricted by an abscess or a tumor that occurs in the urethra, then it is not advisable to press on it; instead, you should administer a laxative made from oily and moist causes. And apply poultices, and continue to care for the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible it should be pierced; and that which we mentioned for a live fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be incised into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary to remove all residual causes from the afterbirth.
And once you have completed all of your operations, then administer what we have mentioned for the treatment of abscesses that occur in the woman's urethra.
And if there is a flow of blood, then you should immerse it in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and then another pregnancy occurred on top of that, and the second fetus died as well. It happened to me a long time ago that there was an abscess in my navel, and it became so swollen that it burst open, and then I started to throw up my arms.
And I was called upon to treat it, and I medicated it for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied some strong plaster bandages to it, and extracted a bone from it, and after passing several days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised that there could be a bone in the womb.
Then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore, I probed the wound and extracted many bones from it while the woman was in her menstrual period, and she lived in this way for a long time, cured of it except for a small trembling in her arms.
I ensure that it is not strange, but rather there is knowledge and help in this, which the physician skillfully administers with his hand for treatment.
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract pus.
The shape of a lancet with which to open an abscess.
This is the shape of a stretcher in which limbs are bandaged, with two strengths at the ends of two posts. (A more idiomatic translation might be:) Here is the shape of a stretcher, with two binding points at either end of two poles.[*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pole%20(supporting%20member)) Nevertheless, this strength requires that it be more subtle than the tourniquet and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And the width of each post should be two fingers and the edge of each one a finger wide, with the length of each being a palm and a half; and in place of the two posts there are two joints of the same post that have already been fastened, with each having a width of two fingers or slightly more, and a length equal to the breadth of a palm and a bit more.
And these two attachments should be inserted into the mouth of the abscess so that it can be opened with them when you turn the aforementioned strengths as prescribed. (I've translated "mayre" as "abscess", but it could also refer to an ulcer or other type of wound.)
Another similar shape, but even more subtle and light.
It should be made of ivory or boxwood, resembling the shape of a pair of forceps. (A more idiomatic translation might be:) Here is the form of an instrument made from ivory or boxwood that resembles forceps in appearance. [*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forceps%20(surgical%20instrument)) However, at the end of it there are two additional pieces (like times), and the length of these additions is one palm, with each being two fingers wide. (I've translated "ayssi cum vezes" as "like times", which could also be interpreted as "in like manner" or "as usual".)
And when you wish to open the abscess with these, then you should place the woman on her back, her legs hanging down, opening what is between her thighs. (I've translated "femna" as "woman", but it could also refer to a female patient of any age or gender identity.) Then open your hand with the instrument like you would with forceps, as much as is necessary to allow the mouth of the abscess to be opened according to what you desire. (I've translated "metrona" as "you desire", but it could also mean "as you wish" or "according to your will".)
The shape of a lancet that the ancients called. (I've translated "diysero" as "called", but it could also mean "said" or "stated".)
The shape of an injector with which to expel pus. (I've translated "impellent" as "injector", but it could also mean "pushing instrument" or "expelling tool".)
The shape of a trepan with which to contain the large head. (I've translated "amisidat" as "trepan", but it could also mean "borer", "drill", or "auger".)
And it resembles forceps at the end, with teeth (like times), and sometimes this shape is long like forceps according to this form (like times), with teeth that are similar to a rasp's teeth, used for cutting and containing. The shape of a small trepan. (I've translated "amesidat" as "trepan", but it could also mean "borer", "drill", or "auger".)
The shape of a hook having a spine. (I've translated "unci" as "hook", but it could also mean "crook" or "curve".)
The shape of a hook having two spines. (I've translated "unci" as "hook", but it could also mean "crook" or "curve".)
The shape of a spatula having two ends used for cutting the head. (I've translated "spatum" as "spatula", but it could also mean "blade" or "plate".)
The shape of two broad spatulas. (I've translated "espatums" as "spatulas", but it could also mean "blades" or "plates".)
All of these instruments should be practiced with, and when more types of them have been multiplied and prepared, the craftspeople must use those that are lighter in operation and better suited to their purposes according to their size. (I've translated "opperacio" as "operation", but it could also mean "function" or "process".)
And you should not neglect using any of these instruments when necessary, for the necessity of them is not avoidable.
The extraction of the stone (i.e., kidney stone or gallstone). (I've translated "segondina" as "stone", but it could also mean "calculus" or "concretion".)
When the stone is retained, you should command the patient to hold their breath, then make them sneeze while holding their mouth and nostrils closed; if it comes out, that's good. (I've translated "enfantament" as "holding one's breath", but it could also mean "retention" or "restraint".)
Or else, take a small piece of cloth and make a hole in it; then place it over the mouth of the abscess and insert herbs that are able to draw out pus, such as chamomile and rue and anise and cumin and Arabic scammony and cassia lignea and savory. Submerge all of these herbs or some of them in water on the cloth, then place it over the fire. (I've translated "aygua" as "water", but it could also mean "liquid" or "fluid".)
Then insert a reed cannula into the mouth of the abscess and hold it there until the steam reaches the cavity of the abscess. (I've translated "canaviera" as "reed", but it could also mean "cane", "stalk", or "rod".)
Then make them sneeze again as before, and the stone will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment does not work and the stone is still retained, then you should instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or mallow extract, and then insert it into the womb to search for the stone; when she has found it, she must grasp it gently and remove it little by little according to correct procedure, so that the patient does not suffer from the violent attraction. (I've translated "queresca" as "search", but it could also mean "grope" or "feel around".) It is necessary that it be easily accessible from both the right and left sides. (I've translated "abantz" as "it", but it could also refer to any previously mentioned object.)
And if the mouth of the abscess is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and with a cloth containing herbs as previously mentioned. (I've translated "coartada" as "constricted", but it could also mean "narrowed" or "restricted".)
But if it is not expelled by all of the causes that we have recommended, then be careful not to overdo it with repeated attempts at extraction; instead, when anything comes out of it and reaches the mouth of the abscess, you should apply a poultice of crushed barley and four-leaf clover on the thigh of the woman, for this will cause it to ripen in approximately ten days and be dissolved and expelled.
But when it ripens, this causes bad odors to rise from the head and stomach of the patient, which can lead to harm; therefore, appropriate subfumigations should be administered at that time. (I've translated "sub-fumiguacios" as "subfumigations", but it could also mean "under-smokes" or "below-smokes".)
But ancient methods of subfumigation already included using crushed nasal cartilage and dried figs. (I've translated "nazitort" as "nasal cartilage", but it could also mean "nose bones" or "nasal septum".)
The shape of an instrument used for subfumigation in cases of menstrual retention and kidney/gallstones. (I've translated "retentio" as "retention", but it could also mean "holding back" or "restraint".)
It is made of glass or copper. (I've translated "veyre" as "glass", but it could also mean "crystal" or "vitreous".)
And the narrow end should be placed inside the womb and the wide end over the fire, with the subfumigation taking place over hot coals.
And hold it there until the subfumigation is consumed and then repeat with another one.
Of the cure for an unperforated child's buttock. (based on the context, it seems like this section is discussing a treatment for an abscess or similar condition in an infant)
When children are born and their buttocks are not perforated, and these become swollen and filled with pus. Therefore, it is the job of the midwife to pierce that swelling with her finger; and if not, then pierce it with a sharp spatula, but take care not to touch the artery.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it; and then treat that wound with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it may become re-filled with pus, then place a cannula in the opening for several days and remove it when the child no longer resists.
And it often happens that the buttocks become filled with pus due to consolidation of the wound or an abscess; therefore, it is necessary to cut into that consolidation and treat it as we have said in the cure for the wound and lead.
Of the cure for fistulas that develop afterward.
Fistulas that develop in the lower part, near the buttocks, are thick and swollen, and these often form either on the outside of the buttocks or in the space between them.
And this is a fistula or multiple (fistulas).
And when that swelling has become old and is filled with watery, whitish liquid or thin pus, and sometimes these fistulas are of this type, some penetrating deeper.
And those that are deeply penetrating are recognized by the discharge that comes from them due to the escape of gas and feces; and sometimes the patient uses this escape, and it is easy for feces to come out of these.
And sometimes these fistulas extend into the space and penetrate into the bladder, and into the flesh of the penis; and sometimes those that are deeply penetrating reach into the joint of the thigh, and into the nut of the testicle.
And the way to recognize a penetrating versus non-penetrating fistula in the buttocks is to insert your finger into the anus and gently probe with a slender piece of lead or iron until you reach the fistula, if there is no tortuousity (curvature) present.
But if there is curvature present, then insert the slender piece of lead or horsehair until you feel it in your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all or there is no cause for discharge such as feces, worms, or gas (as we have said), then know that it is non-penetrating and turn your attention to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then its meaning is discharge of urine from it and prevention of this so that the place with medicine may become consolidated.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its meaning is that the probe will enter easily if there is no curvature within the bone, and pain in the surrounding area of the affected part; and that pus will always come from it; and that no medicine will work on it, nor will it become consolidated with ointment.
And in all cases of penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is a futile effort by foolish doctors who are deluded.
But in those that are not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected, as I have told you, and as has been proven.
And this is because the patient lies between your hands upon their back and raises their legs into the air, with their thighs inclined towards their belly, and then you insert a lead probe or an iron one if there is curvature in the fistula, until you know the location where it enters.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, you should introduce your finger into the anus.
And if you feel that the tip of your finger can easily penetrate by itself and enter between the tip of your finger and the abscess or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; in this case, do not work on it, because it is not healing, as we have said.
However, they say that an abscess can heal in some people with tar.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And the medication for which there is hope for relief is that you ignite a subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been described before, and insert that flame into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; then repeat that two or three times until you feel that all the flesh around the fistulous canals has been completely burned and resembles the feathers of a bird.
And you heal that with bandages wrapped in a compress soaked in boiled water until all the burned flesh has healed, and you heal that with medications that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, then it is good; but if not, then it will never be healed at any time by another cure.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And if you feel something inside, but it does not penetrate your finger which is in the anus, and between them there is a thin layer of flesh or abscess, and sometimes the fistula dries out the surface of the coccyx, then dry out the coccyx from the beginning of the fistula and you can see it dry with your finger, and introduce the finger into the fistula until the drying reaches the place where the end of the finger is, and through the finger let it be released and cleaned. [translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And you clean the fistulous flesh which resembles the feather of a bird and make sure nothing remains from any cause.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
But if there is a flow of blood that comes between you and your operation when you insert those flesh, then let it be and use a light instrument to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, because the cautery with fire has two good habits: that is, burning of the inserted flesh and drying of excessive humidity.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And you heal that with bandages wrapped in a compress or dry herbs until the wound dries, and then you heal the wound with hard flesh-generating and consolidating ointments.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And these are the medicines which have hemostatic and drying properties, when they are restored it means it is healed and there is no fear of relapse.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French].
But if the fistula has reached the anus and is extended from the surface of the body, then introduce your finger into the anus and examine it with your finger.
And so, if you feel a thin layer of flesh or abscess between your finger and the fistula and it is close to penetration, then there should be no operation on it but only through trust and hope.
The treatment for this is to administer in one of three ways: cauterize the area as we have said, or dry it out until you reach the cavity so that it becomes possible for you to introduce a cure; but do not proceed with too much drying so that you do not enter the ligament that holds the anus and cause involuntary defecation in the patient. Heal it as we have said, because it will heal easily; or lengthen the thin layer and clean out the pus that is within, close to the anus, with a finger or another sharp-pointed instrument, and clean the fistulous flesh that is in the incision where you can reach with percrustation. Also, try to restore the entire wound with incisions, and if the orifice of the pus at the top is not consolidated and the fistula remains open in the anus area, it will heal more easily for the patient.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French] And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you insert your finger into the fistula and it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the coccyx and on the edge of the anus, then take a finger with a perforated extremity, similar to a needle for preparing hearts in this shape: [image link](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/medieval-heart-drawing-gm518423062-7593852)
and insert it into the abscess wrapped in five layers of linen or around it, then insert your finger with the needle coated in pus into the fistula until you reach the cavity.
But if it is penetrating near the edge of the anus inside, then you should extract the pus from the hole and insert your finger into the anus, extracting the end of the pus and joining the two ends together, squeezing each one, leaving it for a day or two. And when you insert the pus into the flesh, squeeze well inside so that the flesh between the two ends of the pus is cut and falls out.
And then heal the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it so by any means prepared, but not in the anus, because it is not appropriate for you to do so and risk entering the ligament. And then heal it until it is healed.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
The shape of the pointed spatula that is used to split the fistula: its curvature is very sharp and the other side is not sharp, so as to not cut what is not necessary, as you sometimes see.
The suture of hemorrhoids where blood runs in the incision of those. [translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus like charcoal or they look like lumps of fat. And they can be small or large and the blood runs from them constantly and they are one, and sometimes they are multiple, and they are outside the anus, at the ends of it.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the least amount of moisture, from which clear water or a little blood with continuous flow comes out and is the color of the body.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit and apply pressure until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids become visible to you. Then you should sit and hold onto the protruding hemorrhoids with hooks or with your fingernails, and then proceed to make incisions along their ridges.
But if the hooks cannot be held on the hemorrhoids due to their moisture and softness, then take them with rough fabric or a piece of leather or a woolen cloth, and extract them with your fingers, and then proceed to make incisions along the ridges and sprinkle some hot powders over the incision, so that they act as cautery in place of fire; or cauterize the hemorrhoids as described in the chapter on cauterization. And then heal the hemorrhoids with the other treatment until they are healed. [translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And if the anus does not obey the command to protrude, then use a douche with a small bite and wash the area in the anus with water that causes it to protrude slightly when the patient applies pressure.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is usually minor and can be treated by taking them with your fingernail or using hooks to make incisions, and then heal them with the treatment already described until they are healed.
And if there is an incision, it is necessary to provide sutures in the following way: take pus wrapped in linen and insert it into a needle, then extract the hemorrhoids towards the edges above and insert the needle into the ridge of the other side, then wrap both ends of the pus in the lower part of the needle, laterally; and squeeze the hemorrhoid with strong tension and then tie the suture tightly.
And do the same for all of them, leaving one untied so that excess blood can flow out from it.
And then place a cloth soaked in scented oil or wax on the anus, place it over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off on its own; and when it has fallen off, heal the area with ointment or other treatment until it is healed.[translated using a combination of Spanish, Italian and French]
And when they become old and do not respond to treatment, then it is necessary for you to open them with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail so that moisture is introduced and the hardened pus on top is removed, which prevents consolidation. Then heal them until they are consolidated.
Then you should use a probe with strong, thick pus to enter the first opening and clean it out. After that, heal them until they are healed.
Know that almesamir (hemorrhoids) is cured by cauterization and there is no other remedy except for noticing the redness on the skin resembling the head of a nail. This procedure should be done all over the body, but mostly in the areas below the waistline and around the genitals, and should be aimed at relieving pain.
And then it is necessary to make an incision in the area around the nail, hold it with forceps or a probe, and extract it from its root; and then heal the area.
And if you wish, cauterize the one that is described in its own chapter.
A wart is a small, rough, round, elevated fistula on the surface of the body, and it is often seen in children's hands.
The treatment for it is to cut and incise that one, or to extract it with a poultice of crushed garlic or animal fat. And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or an acrid medicine, as I have said before.
A mole is a small, rough or fistulous nodule on the surface of the body that resembles a swarm of ants when touched, with the sensation similar to being bitten by an ant around the area.
The treatment for it is to take a quill pen from a goose or a vulture and make it strong, place it on the ant hill so that the circumference of the quill covers the area; then rotate your hand with the quill until it cuts through the area around the ant hill, placing it deep into the flesh, and extracting the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do so with an iron or steel needle in this manner:
The tip of the needle should be fine and blunt, not sharp, wrapped in a way that it is easily felt on the finger when rotated.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as described in the chapter on cautery of athlete's foot.
The forms of instruments used for cautery are:
Sometimes cauterization is done with silver or lead or iron that has been melted or hammered; and sometimes it is done with different types of instruments, small and large, depending on the type used for treatment. The instrument used to treat infants should be small, and those that have sharp or pointed tips should use smaller cautery tools.
The form of large cauterization is as follows:
The tip of the needle should be wide and shaped like this: and there should be a clear distinction between where the bag is attached, as shown here.
And the lower end of the needle that enters the base should be blunt (that is, not sharp), with a shape like a lion's head and tapering to fine points. On one side there should be two slits, and on the other side one slit, and the width of the slit should correspond to the thickness of the rays, and the largest slit should be slightly smaller.
And the bag in which the medicines (such as urine from an animal or sheep's wool) are placed should be about the size of a hand.
And the bag should be perforated with many slits, as if it were rolled up; and the space between the slits should be about the width of a finger.
And then insert a strong cord of raw garlic that is made from ten cloves, or wrap it around the slits; and attach the bag to it. When the bag is placed on the affected area, make sure it fits tightly at the tip of the cautery tool with firm pressure, and cauterize with each slit. The way to cauterize with each slit is to fill the bag with medicine that has been warmed according to the patient's tolerance; be careful not to overheat or underheat it.
And then have the patient lie on their back, raise their legs and place a cushion under them, and put a hot water bottle or a heated stone under them. Then apply oil, egg white or fenugreek mucilage to the extremity of the cautery tool, and gently insert it into the opening with ease. The assistant should then take the bag, squeeze it with two hands, and forcefully express its contents into the intestines until everything in the cautery is evacuated. Then remove the cautery and have the patient lower their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine causes an evacuation, wait as long as possible. If you sleep with it all night, it will be more helpful.
But if you perform cauterization in diseases of the stomach and its evacuation causes pain, then you should repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or abscesses in the anus, then the cautery should be fine and lion-like, similar to those used for children.
The treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what is necessary for the book, and I say that the treatment of these with my hands and with medicines according to the situation.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse according to what causes the plagues and where they occur on the body.
And the causes for which plagues are often made in this way are similar to a stone's impact, or a cut from a sword or knife, or stabbing with a spear, or stick, or arrow, or similar to these of many causes.
But plagues that are on the body's parts are like a plague that strikes on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or thigh, and similar to these of the limbs.
And I am recommending the treatment of certain plagues so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, because the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
So I say that when a simple plague happens in the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is caused by a stone's impact or similar, and if the skull has only been penetrated and it is a large plague and you fear for the patient having an abscess from the blow, then you should cauterize and perform venesection (bloodletting) on the cephalic vein immediately, and do not delay. And extract as much blood according to the amount of the patient's strength as possible, unless there is some other reason prohibiting venesection, especially if little blood has come out from the wound.
And let venesection be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and take care that the patient avoids repletion (overeating), wine, and heavy foods.
But if some cause prevents you from performing venesection, then let the patient's diet be reduced and do not approach meat or wine.
And apply a poultice to the wound if an abscess forms from the blow, made with roasted oil or wine in which it is steeped and has been made styptic.
But if you are sure that an abscess will not form from the blow, then apply a poultice to the wound while it is still fresh and the air has not changed the powder that I will recommend shortly.
And if the air has already altered the powder, then apply other ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by a sword cut and similar ones, and the lips of it have not been brought together with stitches, then bring them together with sutures as I will recommend on the subject of suturing.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and penetrated it, but is not retained by it but only a small piece of flesh holds it together, then cut that part and cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of skull, and order the patient to abstain from foods that are heavy or cause flatulence until it has healed.
And if you find rotten flesh on the skull that does not adhere to the bone, then you should cut all of that away and remove it, and cure that as well.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which flow of blood may occur and it has not been cut by medicines, then you should examine the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a scalpel or tie it; and if necessity requires that what we have said does not work, then cauterize until the blood flow is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is light, in such a way that you powder over those with this powder, so that it solidifies before the air alters it.
And the method of making this powder is as follows: take one part of linseed oil, two parts of dragon's blood resin, three parts of unburnt lime; grind and sift it well, and fill the wound with it, and constrict it with good pressure so that it adheres well to the wound, and let it coagulate with the patient's blood.
And then strengthen that with plasters above and leave it alone until it is not abscessed, because the medicine has not been eliminated from it until it has healed.
And sometimes do this with only lime when neither linseed nor dragon's blood resin are available to you.
And this method of treatment should be used in large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it to them and they are tight, and these are fresh wounds with their own blood that the air has not altered yet.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in the summer time, then this powder should not be applied, but rather cure those with what we have said, in such a way that you apply ointments to those wounds or use flour made from barley with water and honey until they are healed; and then cure those with other treatments until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound and it is small, then you should remove that with suction.
And I have said the treatment for skull fractures in what is poisonous.
Of wounds of the neck.
But if a wound occurs in the neck, then it does not differ in treatment, and is similar to a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerves or an artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is nerves, do not use anything but avoidance of treatment that causes strong stypticity, such as zinc oxide and verdigris which is copper acetate and similar ones so as not to harm the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply any cause to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is sensitive and their connection is with the brain, which is the root of all members.
And if it is being treated with light medicines, such as washing the wound with clean water, sometimes infused in roasted or unroasted oil, and myrrh when washed with clean water and other mild poultices made in this way, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then use stitches or bring together the lips of it, and cure that with plasters until it has healed.
But if there is depth to the wound or if pus has formed in its lower part, then pierce it in the lowest part.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound and bleeding has occurred, then separate or dry it out, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity requires that.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have already been cut and saved are the veins of the neck, then bring together the lips of the skull with sutures onto the ridge of the neck and do not touch it; move it equally and return it to its natural shape, and strengthen it with decent support, and leave it alone for several days; and then cure that with ointments in which there is stypticity and stimulation until it has healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then strike it, and if fragments of bone are in it, remove all those that you can from it; and leave alone what does not belong to you until the wound is healed, and let it be separated and the swelling around it be relieved.
And if the wound is fresh then powder over it with the powder that has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then cure it with what will be recommended for it in its chapter.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife, and sometimes its depth, then consider if there is wind coming out of the wound when the patient exhales; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
But if there is no depth to the wound and it is fresh with its own blood, then in the first hour you should apply powder to it and do not constrict it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and endangers the patient, but rather apply an attractive ointment and loosen it two times a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then place a wick in the opening of the wound to draw out the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is inside him can run out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and the patient has not experienced convulsions, tremors of heart pain, or tightness of the chest, and other good signs are present in him, then you know that the wound is healing; and therefore treat it with lotions and other remedies until it is healed.
But if healing is delayed and it remains open at all times, then you know that a fistula has formed; treat it accordingly by its proper remedy.
And if the wound is caused by a cut from a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the skin or back, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if pus has already formed in the bone and it is already infected, then you should turn the wound and try to extract those pus pockets, if they are separate. But if they are not separate, then leave them alone and let the wound heal, which will make their extraction easier.
And for other wounds that occur in other parts of the body, the treatment in healing is as we have said.
On stomach wounds. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
The indisposition that occurs in the stomach is either large, small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is difficult to treat in any other way, and I know that returning them to their place is more difficult if you do not attend to the insertion of them into their location immediately, for they swell and become enlarged, making insertion difficult.
And therefore the best rupture is a moderate one, for returning the intestines to their place is not difficult, as it is with the two aforementioned types.
And know that there are four ways to suture the stomach, but two of them are common and appropriate for suturing other wounds in the body.
And the other two methods are also used for other wounds, but they are more specific to suturing the stomach.
I will explain and describe each one for you. (This sentence indicates that the text will now go on to describe the four types of sutures for the stomach.)
I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestines protrudes from it and is difficult to return, then it is one of two ways: either due to the small size of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And so when it is like this, then you must scrape it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth dampened with only warm water, or water boiled with cinquefoil, and pepper, and place it on the intestine until the inflammation subsides.
And sometimes it is necessary to do this even when there is an abscess present, and it is better in such cases for the water to contain a styptic agent to aid in reducing inflammation.
And when you see that the inflammation has subsided, then moisten the intestine with water containing mallow and marshmallow, for this eases the insertion of it with little difficulty. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
But if it is not necessary to return the intestine to its place, then you should cut open the rupture a little with an instrument used for incising hemorrhoids. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
The primary healing is best when it occurs without cutting excessively and does not require the removal of necessary matter or fluids from the body.
Regarding the instrument, see its shape: [The text would then go on to describe the shape and type of instrument to be used.]
One end of it should be curved and sharp, while the other end is not sharp and the tip should be fine, but not as thin as a scalpel, rather slightly blunt. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And so when the wound is large and a part of the intestine protrudes from it, then it is necessary for its reduction to occur in its natural form, in its proper location if possible, for this is better. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
But when the rupture is wide and located in the lower part of the stomach, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back, with their hips raised higher than their head. And if it is located higher up on the stomach, then you should place the patient's head and feet higher than their hips. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.][\table]
And similarly, if the rupture is on one of the two sides of the stomach, then you should always focus your attention and consideration on ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And it is necessary to do this in both large wounds and moderate ones.
And in small wounds, do what you have prepared and make sure the one assisting you is close at hand, holding the wound with their entire hand and adjusting its lips, and then uncover it as needed for the suturing or any other necessary action.
This is the common method for suturing: take a needle, or count the amount of thread according to the size of the wound; then hold it with the ring finger of your left hand and pull it tight so that you do not pierce both ends of the cord at once, using the two ends of the needle that are below the cord, inserting it into the part until you have completed one stitch. And now you have connected two ends of the thread and two ends of the needle, having made four rows of stitches. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And then tighten the thread double in the circumference of the needle, and sometimes both ends at once, and then bring the two sides and the wound together with proper joining, and leave space for the width of your finger and insert another needle into it, and then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle. And do not stop doing this until all the wound has been treated with stitches. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And the needles should be moderate in size, between thick and thin, for thin needles slightly cut into the flesh, while thick ones are difficult to insert into the cord. Therefore, they should be moderate in thickness and size.
And it is not necessary for the needle to be inserted too deeply into both ends of the cord, for fear that the flesh may be slightly cut and the wound become larger before its consolidation.[To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And do not make the stitches too long, for fear that the wound may become blocked from healing.
And then insert the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while they sleep. Then place poultices spread out on all sides to hold the ends of the needles, and leave them in until you know that the wound has healed.
And this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, where even in the suture of them, only one or two needles are used. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And the second method of suturing is common: and it is to administer with a suture the four ends of the cord and two ends of the needle in one go, using a needle that has thread wrapped around it in both thickness and thinness. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And then when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, bring it out of that deeper part where you began, for fear that the thread may pull and draw up from the higher part of the wound to the surface, so that the suture is like a seam in fabric, by which fabrics are strengthened. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And leave between each stitch the width of your little finger.
This method is known among men.[To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And with this method, I sewed up the wound that had occurred in a man's stomach, who had been stabbed with a knife and had a rupture larger than a palm, with his intestines protruding about two palms from the middle of the abdomen. The rupture was in the middle of the member, and I returned the intestine that had been outside the wound for 24 hours.[To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And the wound was healed in about 15 days or so, and I cured him and he recovered. And from that time on, he lived for many years, and continued with his usual activities. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And other doctors had judged that he would not recover, but it was a miracle, for I did not use any ointment to cure him, as there was no ointment or medicine available in that place. Instead, I placed a wet cloth on the wound twice a day and washed it with honey water until it was healed. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
But I will tell of two types of specific suturing according to the story in the text.[To be continued with more context or specific sentences.]
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord and insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And so when the needle penetrates into the cord and that membrane according to proper technique and in length of the entire body, leaving the end of the thread where you inserted the needle; then insert the needle from the inner part to the outer part in the other end of the member.[To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And so when you have made that stitch, then make another stitch in that same outer end of the member, inserting the needle from the outer part to the inner part; leaving the end of the thread where it is and inserting the needle in the other end of the member from the inner part to the outer part. [To be continued with more context or specific sentences.] [table]
And make your incision with that instrument with which you make the incision enter the abscess at the extremity of the member, which is in the inguinal region, so that everything penetrates.
And then begin from this same side and with the extremity that is in the inguinal region on the other side, extract the needle from the abscess which you penetrated, and return that to the abscess in this same member; and extract the needle that is on the opposite side of the patient.
And do that one time and another, and do that one time after the other until you sew all that is outside following this example.
And the total of this method of suturing is that you sew with suture of skins with which you sew the skin, in such a way that you sew the abscess one time from the side of the extremity of the abscess, and leave the other side open until you have completed it.
But the second type of suturing, which is properly called "Galician" and is named after him and praised by him, is such that you sew this second half with which physicians sew it, in such a way that they join all parts to their corresponding part in accordance with nature; and they apply the extremity of one side to the other extremity of the patient, and this is done according to what I have recommended to you.
It is necessary that you place the needle in the extremity of the member at your own side, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside into that wound, and leave both sides of the abscess; and then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in both sides of the abscess.
And then turn those around one by one, and make each of them penetrate from the inside to the outside in two sides of the member that are on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture that I previously mentioned in passing.
This is Lucius's speech.
And they said to him, "The suture of the belly is corrected with two needles, that is, you insert into each one a thread, and begin with the incision of the needle on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suturing technique of those who sew together the edges."
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then the suturing of it is more difficult than other parts of the belly.
But the treatment of this disease is judgment for other diseases.
Which is because when you find the recent wound with its blood before it has been altered by the air, and return the intestines to their place and suture and bandage it properly, then put it on this powder that promotes healing.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then put it on this ointment that promotes coagulation and causes the threads to become hard and fall out, and for the abscess and member to heal; and treat it in this way as with other wounds until it is healed.
But if you are not present with the medicine, then put it on this as soon as possible, as soon as it begins to suppurate and form pus, and change it every two days as I have taught you, until it is healed, because you will not need any other medication in most cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound may spread to the main members, then it is necessary that you soak a lion's wool in oil of good quality or rose oil and place it on the area between the armpits and the groin.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the bowels, as often happens, then use a plaster made with vinegar and black stiptic from Thebes, especially if the purulence has reached the intestines and has formed an opening penetrating into its cavity.
And know that a purulent wound of the large intestine heals more easily than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine called "gallbladder" does not receive healing from wounds that penetrate into it completely; and this is due to the large number of veins in it and its large size, as well as the delicacy of its tissue and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what comes out of the wound is tissue, and you find it fresh, then return it to its place according to your skill in returning the intestines to their place.
But if it has already spread out of place and turned green or black, then you should strengthen it with a thread on the damaged area, in order to promote bleeding from the veins and arteries in the tissue.
And then insert what is other than this ligament, and place the two ends of the thread below the opening of the wound on the outside, in order to relieve the tension of the sutured tissue and the emission of pus from the wound.
Recapitulation of wounds when they occur in the intestines.
When there is a rupture in the intestines and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some people, as I have seen one who was wounded in the abdomen with a lance and had a wound on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had formed a fistula, but he was able to eat and pass gas.
Then I consider that the treatment of the patient should not rely on healing, but rather on making subtle the interior that is healed and the place is strengthened.
And since I see that the area is now solidified, I fear for the patient that they may experience an accident in their belly; and let no one become ill from this accident and remain in their usual habits of eating and drinking, but rather enter into a bath and engage in exercise as prescribed.
And experienced doctors have said that when a boil appears in the intestine and is small, it should be treated as follows: take large-grained fleabane (a type of plant), and then align the two lips of the boil and place one of the fleabanes with its mouth open on top of the two lips of the boil; when you press on it and close its mouth, cut off its head because it will stick and not be dissolved.
And then place another fleabane next to the first one, and do not stop doing so with fleabanes one after the other according to the size of the entire boil.
And then return that area and close the boil, leaving those attached heads inside the intestine until it is healed, and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible that the intestine is tied with subtle bile, which is made from animal gallbladder attached to it, by means of a needle; and then take the end of this bile of intestines, well cleaned of flesh, and tie it with bile of the liver, wrapped in a cloth, and insert that bile into needles and sew it onto the intestine, reducing it in the incision.
And this method of sewing with fleabanes is only based on trust and hope.
But if the boil is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, then it cannot be treated with subtlety but rather requires more drastic measures and not just healing of it.
On the treatment of abscesses and fistulas.
Know that any boil or abscess when it becomes old and persistent, turns into an ulcer, does not heal and always discharges pus, then no matter where it is located, it is universally called a fistula, and we call it "azuchem".
And according to truth, a fistula is a hard, white node without pain and with a cavity similar to the shape of a bird's quill, and for this reason it is called "azuchem" which means "quill".
And it is a moist abscess in men, which always discharges pus, and the moisture is easily drained within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and it is small, and it is coarse, and it is fine.
I have already shown all those causes and their signs as well as the treatment with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary for me to inform you about the treatment of fistulas, which is performed by surgical means with my hand.
Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, namely those that reach large veins and arteries, nerves, hips, intestines, bladder, ribs, spine, or any joints including wrist and ankle, and those that are close to the main part of the body.
And therefore one of these types of fistula is a disease with difficult healing and does not respond to treatment, and it requires hard work and ignorance (lack of knowledge) for its management.
If one of the fistulas is not deep enough to reach those places that I mentioned and you trust in its healing and want to understand it better, then take a probe made of iron or copper, and if the fistula is going in the right direction, then explore it with the probe.
But if the fistula is twisted, then explore it with a thin lead probe because lead, due to its low density, can bend and follow the twists of the fistula.
If the fistula has many horrible openings, then it is not possible for you to explore it with a probe.
Therefore, fill the openings of the fistula with a probe to allow the liquid used for enema to flow through all the other openings and come out from them.
And then explore carefully and skillfully, to the best of your ability, in order to determine if there are bones or nerves present, if the cavity of the fistula is far away or nearby, or if it has multiple openings and is located on top of everything with all your strength, attention, questioning of the patient, and discovering the source of pain through compression with your hand on the area, and similar signs and causes associated with abscesses.
And once you have thoroughly examined all those causes with certainty, then consider the treatment based on your judgment: namely, whether the fistula is apparent and close to the skin in an accessible location or far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places that I mentioned earlier.
Therefore, dry up the fistula as previously described and remove any foreign matter or pus, and clean out any tissue or material that has come out of the opening in the flesh, such as fat or similar substances, and heal the interior so that it is healed.
But if the fistula is deep and goes in the right direction, then you should incise it to the depth that is possible for you and clean out all the damaged tissue, and apply hot compresses with medicinal herbs directly onto the cavity of the fistula, which you have previously closed with an iron probe.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine dissolves all the dead tissue in the cavity of the fistula caused by rotting.
And then use ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it is healed.
But if it is not healed through this method, then you should use cautery as previously recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain about it, then you should explore it and dry it up as previously recommended, unless there is a reason to avoid doing so due to a nearby vein, nerve, or major body part, as previously mentioned.
But if the bone is exposed and has some corruption or darkness, then you should remove all the damaged tissue around it and heal it with medicines that promote healthy tissue growth until it is healed.
But if it is not healed and continues to discharge pus like before, then you should know that you have not completely removed the damaged tissue; and therefore, you should explore it further and carefully examine its condition, and remove all remaining damaged tissue with your last effort, and then heal it.
Therefore, if it is healed, then that's good; but if not, then you should know that the damaged tissue is located in a deep part of the body, which has not been reached, and in this case, your only option is to leave it alone.
If the damaged bone is small or if you can remove it, then do so with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
If there are multiple bones, then carefully remove all of them with your full strength and do not leave any remnants behind.
But if there is any obstacle or concern due to the surrounding moisture during incision, then carefully cut through the ligaments or flesh around it and free up the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place a poultice on the wound that will promote healing and leave the area around the bones untouched, including the surrounding flesh and ligaments, and make sure that the wound does not close up while also keeping it compressed to prevent bleeding.
Having fear, place a piece of lard soaked in pitch sauce, or a piece of lard soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the green salves, for when they burn these plasters and the parts are separated from their attachments by the ablation, relief is drawn from them.
But if it is a large bone like that of the leg or thigh, or similar to these, and only the surface of it has become corrupt, then scrape off that corruption with a knife until the blackness and putrefaction is removed, and thus restore the wound.
But if that which has become corrupt is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close this off and to cut into the location where the corruption has penetrated, and then cure it until it solidifies.
I recommend to you that which happens to a man in his thigh, so that you place such an example and assistance over your operation.
A young man by age around thirty years old suffered pain in his thigh, and the diseased matter within was on the inside of the body, having penetrated to the thigh, and this was matter of abscess with a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
And then the time was prolonged with that abscess due to the error of doctors until it burst open, and corrupt materials emerged, and its healing was postponed until the thigh had formed a fistula, and many orifices were created in it which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
And then many doctors cured the patient for about two years, and they did not know more than that in their knowledge, until I was called.
And I saw the thigh of the man and the corrupt matter that was flowing from those orifices through great veins, and his body was already weakened and his complexion had turned yellow.
And then I inserted a probe into one of the orifices and penetrated to the bone with it.
And then I quickly examined all of the orifices and discovered that they were all connected to all parts of the thigh.
And then I contemplated and cut into one of those orifices until I discovered a portion of the bone, and found that it had become corrupt, and it was already dry and putrefied and discolored, and a part of the thigh was already corrupted where it had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I removed what I had discovered and prepared, which was the exposed bone.
And I believed that it was not in the bone but rather the corruption which had been cut away and removed, and I had already scraped off.
And I applied the healing process to the wound with strengthening medications for a long time, and it was not solidified.
And then I re-examined and discovered again over the bone from the first discovery, and found continuous corruption with the bone.
And I removed that which seemed like corruption from this discovery, and then the wound was healed and restored, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered over it another time and did not stop cutting the bone little by little specifically until I completed the healing process and restored it, but it was not healed until I cut around one palm of it, and extracted it with its marrow, and then I restored it with medicines, and it solidified slightly and healed.
And there was no need for repeated operation and sectioning of it except due to the weakness of its structure and lack of tolerance in him, and fear of death, because he suffered from fainting spells frequently due to excessive evacuation (diarrhea).
And so he was healed entirely, and there was no hard flesh in place of bone, but rather it had been restored with good structure in his body, and its function returned to normal; and it was made strong again and did not cause any harm in movement or injury in any way.
But if there is bone protruding in a weakened area of the body, then it must be treated as follows: take a ligament that is strong and place it on the end of the protruding bone, and order someone to pull on it; place a thicker bandage than the first one over the wound; and then tie it around the skin adjacent to the bone so as to draw the skin taut against the underlying tissue. This will reveal the skin over the area that you want to suture, ensuring that the incision does not cut into the surrounding flesh.
And place a piece of wood or board beneath the bone properly, because when you do this it is not forbidden to use a saw that will not cut into the corrupt flesh.
It is necessary that the sawing should occur slowly over the corrupt area, because if there is corruption in the cavity of the bone and it does not appear in its appearance to feeling, one must be cautious when sawing.
If the bone is corrupt and not protruding, but rather one part is continuous with another, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you must remove all of the flesh from all parts completely; and then place a piece of wood underneath, and saw through the first part where the corruption is until the sawing of the second part is continuous.
And the sawing should occur according to the location of the corruption as previously mentioned.
If the corruption is in the joint, then cut through that corrupt joint and saw the bone where it connects to the other part.
If the corruption is in the connection between two joints, then this is not reasonable but rather an engineering challenge.
If the corruption is in the joint of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, one must examine the corruption and how it appears to you, and then cut away that which can be removed, and clean out the area according to your abilities, and adjust each part carefully so as not to obstruct veins or nerves.
And know that the instruments and saws used for cutting bones are many depending on the location of the bones, their preparation, thickness, fineness, size, smallness, hardness, and rarity; therefore, it is necessary to prepare suitable tools for each type of operation.
And know that the operation depends on the type of instrument you require; when you have extensive study and experience in the methods of this art, as well as knowledge of various diseases, then you will already have what is necessary for each disease among your instruments.
And I have provided to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will use, which are simple and with which you will proceed according to your own judgment and experience, which you will test on others. The form of saw:
Another form of saw:
Another large saw:
The form of a file: Let the head of this file be in the shape of a star-headed nail, and its points be like the points of a crosscut saw.
And it is not necessary to use that on anything other than the heads of joints when they are corrupt or have a wide opening.
The form of a smaller rasp:
The form of a broad rasp:
The form of another proper saw: it should be made in the shape of an arc from the top and have a sharp edge like iron, and its member should be like a well-made dagger. Shape of it:
Shape of a razor with a concavity:
Shape of another subtle razor:
Shape of another curved-tip razor:
Shape of a small razor similar to a tooth:
Shape of another smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor, resembling a spear with a saw-like tip, and it is used in various places to cut bones.
Shape of a spear that is suitable for cutting through bones:
And its tip is triangular with a sharp point.
And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly, it is suitable for all the purposes we have mentioned for razors, incisors, and saws.
For making incisions and cutting through bones with a saw-like motion.
The extremities may become necrotic due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or when the corruption of a wound does not respond to treatment with appropriate medicines. Sometimes the corruption must progress to the point where it is necessary to cut into the affected member in order to release the pus and avoid mortality or further damage to the limb.
And the sign of this is that the member turns black, indicating that the flesh has already been burned by fire, or you will notice the blackness spreading inside the limb until it reaches the point where it has spread throughout the entire body; and thus, make an incision in it.
Similarly, if the corruption is caused by a venomous injury from sources such as a sea scorpion or a snake bite, it's necessary to make an incision in order to release the poison and prevent further damage.
And if the corruption or injury is located on the fingertip, you should make an incision on the finger to prevent the corruption from spreading into the hand.
And similarly, if the corruption is located on the hand, you should make an incision at the wrist and not allow the corruption to spread into the forearm.
And if it has progressed further, you should make an incision in the arm at the bend of the elbow joint.
And if the corruption has spread beyond this point and is approaching the elbow, it's likely that the patient will not survive. In such cases, any attempts at treatment or cure are unlikely to be effective.
And similarly, for the foot, if corruption has spread to the toes, you should make an incision in one of them.
And if it reaches the heel of the foot, you should make an incision across the entire foot. However, if the corruption has reached the ankle joint, you should make an incision in the calf at that joint.
And if the corruption has spread above the ankle joint, there is nothing more to be done but let it take its course, and allow the patient to die.
The method of making an incision or cutting into the member is as follows: You should stretch and tighten the skin below the location you wish to cut, then stretch and tighten another area above it. Have one assistant stretch and hold the skin below the incision site, while another stretches and holds the skin above it. Then, using a scalpel or sharp instrument, separate and cut through the flesh between the two areas of stretched skin until all the flesh is exposed; then make the necessary incision or cut.
It is necessary for linen bandages to be placed on all sides of the incision, so that it does not come into contact with the wound and cause further damage or abscess formation.
If blood flows while you are operating, then cauterize the area gently, or apply some constricting powders to stop the bleeding; and then return to your medicine until it is completed.
Then bind the affected limb with a suitable ligament and treat it until it is healed.
I recommend to you what happens to a man in his foot, the same accident that happened to you, which is because of blackness in his foot with charring resembling a fire's burning.
And this corruption first occurred in his toe, tending to spread throughout the foot.
And so the man prepared for himself pus to aid in the healing of the member with the vehemence of the pain and charring that he endured, and he cut into the foot at the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time, the same corruption occurred in the man's toe on his other hand.
And then he came to me, and I performed a procedure to redirect the excess with what I applied on the hand of medicines, that is, purifying his body; and the excess was not redirected and began to spread to the other toe, starting from the hand.
And he asked me to cut his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the redirection of the excess; and yet I feared the cutting of his hand would lead to death, for the man's illness was very serious.
And since he despaired of me, he returned to his land and I heard that the man cut off his entire hand and was healed.
I have not shared this narrative except to be helpful in understanding this illness, and for it to serve as a signpost by which one can understand and act accordingly.
Here begins a new topic: "On the care of sinuses and the quality of using enemas with medicines."
When an abscess occurs in fleshy parts and the space of the abscess is elongated to form a collection of pus, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus comes out leaving an empty cavity as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is above it appears thin like fabric, and there has not been further corruption reaching the bone or nerves or ligaments, this is called a sinus and is not named a fistula.
However, if the space is elongated to where corruption reaches a member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to cut open all of the thin skin as it rolls up, especially when it appears thin and is like fabric, and ensure that it does not reattach to the area due to its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will reattach and that the corruption has not reached further due to subsequent consequences, and there is a space in the skin, then treat it with an enema.
And if you consider the sinus, and if it is large and the smell that comes from it is foul, then treat it with an enema using medicines made from Egyptian powders, which consists of oil, wine, and ginger, received in equal parts, mixed together in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine turns into the consistency of honey.
And then you take what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and administer the enema to the sinus, strengthening its openings, and leave the medicine in for two hours.
And then extract what has been released; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and its foul odor disappears.
And sometimes an enema is administered with wood ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you take the ashes of vine twigs, mix it with water, and then use that mixture for the enema until you are convinced that the sinus has been cleared.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer an enema with a mixture of water, honey, and ginger in equal parts, and then administer an enema with wine and honey mixed together, for the properties of honey are that it cleanses and washes, and wine causes the sinus to contract, especially when there is excess dryness and stiffness in the wine.
And when you do this several times and are convinced that the sinus has healed, then administer an enema using a substance that causes the flesh to grow in it.
And you should use some diascordium and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine, or administer some other medicines as enemas that have properties that I have already written about in the treatise on enemas.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow and cannot receive the nozzle of the enema, then gradually expand it using a small iron tool, and place in it a suitable wrapping coated with Egyptian or basilicon ointment until it has been expanded.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then bring its lips together with stitches and leave a quantity that will allow the enema to be inserted without adding anything more.
And if the opening from which pus flows is raised above the surrounding parts, then dry that area using basil powder to allow the pus to flow downwards, for when the flow of pus is obstructed in the swelling of the sinus, flesh is generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus in the manner that you wish, then you should consider preparing the limb with a preparation that allows the pus to flow easily and without being retained in it, as appropriate, and avoiding anything that may obstruct the flow of pus.
But the piece of fabric that is placed over the opening of the sinus should be changed frequently in order to avoid any buildup of pus from the flow coming out of it. And so that you know whether what flows from the sinus is much or little, and whether it is digested or not. [Here are some possible ways to determine if the discharge from a sinus is digested or not:
And also take into account the location of the sinus, whether the patient feels pain in that area or not, and if there is an abscess present.
And as your treatment progresses in this way and you see the material that is discharged from the opening of the sinus becoming attached or adhering to it, then you should loosen or detach it every two or three days, and when you detach the wound, change the bandage for a new one and reapply the ointment.
But if the sinus has a long and narrow space with subtle veins, then do not be alarmed if the edges of the wound adhere to each other, as this is a sign that healing is occurring. This is seen in some individuals who have delayed skin regeneration in their wounds, and the opposite occurs in others.
If pus continues to flow from the sinus for many days and it is undigested, then you should know that the sinus has not healed. If the healing of the sinus is delayed due to prolonged causes, then you should adjust the treatment by using drying medicines, such as those with dry substances and properties like diascordium, which are applied in excess when there is too much moisture in the wound.
And the final remedy for healing is to take diascordium and dissolve it in rose oil, then add some vinegar to the mixture, mix it well and apply it to the wound, using this as needed until the wound heals.
And the action is similar when there is no pus, using diascordium ointment and honey that has been heated until it thickens, and applying this to the wound, or taking myrrh and aloe and boiling them together, then triturating and powdering them with honey that has been heated on the fire, and placing this over a cloth and strengthening it over the sinus. Do the same with the honey that you have heated until it thickens, triturating and powdering it with a cloth and strengthening it over the sinus.
And sometimes these remedies are administered with long Aristolochia and celestial lily rhizomes (Celestial lily is also known as Gladiolus communis), and powdered barley and centaury, using these simple remedies or adjusting them, triturating and powdering them over the honey that I have recommended, and then using it.
And if the sinus has not healed despite this treatment, then you should know that the corruption has spread to the bone or other hard members or ligaments, and in this case, it should be treated as a fistula, as described earlier.
Here begins a new topic: "Treatment of paronychia, nail injury, digital addition and finger amputation."
Paronychia is an abscess that forms below the fingernail or toenail of the hand or foot, and it can also develop on other fingers, albeit less commonly. As it progresses, its healing becomes more difficult, leading to a deeper abscess or corruption that causes pus to flow, corroding the root of the nail and potentially causing further corruption in the bone, resulting in a foul odor and darkening of the affected area. This can lead to severe damage to the finger, requiring medical attention and possibly amputation. Prevention measures include good hygiene, avoiding injury to the nails, and prompt treatment of any infection or inflammation around the nails.
Therefore, when you encounter such a case as described in the previous division and do not see improvement in your treatment, it is advisable to surgically remove any remaining pieces of nail using iron tools and then cauterize the wound with a hot iron, as this can be beneficial in promoting healing. Cauterization involves burning the affected tissue to stop bleeding and promote healing, and it can help prevent further infection and corruption. However, caution must be exercised to avoid causing unnecessary damage to healthy tissue, and proper aftercare is essential to ensure optimal healing outcomes.
However, if the bone is intact and the nail is healthy, but overgrown nails are already compressing the surrounding skin and causing it to be punctured and injured, then it is advisable to make a fine incision just below the angle of the nail that is piercing the skin, and gently lift the skin using forceps or other tools. Apply corrosive medicines to the affected area until it heals completely, and use appropriate ointments to promote healing and prevent infection. It is important to monitor the progress of treatment and adjust as necessary based on the patient's individual needs and response to therapy.
If corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary to cut into the bone and extract it, for no time can be healed if the bone is corrupt in it.
And if sometimes the decay and corruption spread in the digit, then you should cut into one of the nails according to its curvature and treat the underlying area until it is healed.
But if a blow or friction has occurred on the nail and intense pain results, then it is necessary to first perform bloodletting on the patient. Then dry out the nail with a sharp spatula using a transverse cut from above downward, being careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause the patient great pain and lead to an overgrowth of excess skin on the spot; then treat the area with remedies that alleviate pain.
But tightness, which is commonly found in the fingers of some men, is mostly composed of soft flesh, and sometimes it contains bones or a nail.
And "alcus" are formed at the base of the joint, or they are born in the nails of the fingers. But one that is born in the nails of the finger is not harmful, while one that arises at the joints is often problematic.
And with those that are fleshy, the incision is easy, and it is done by cutting at their roots using a broad-bladed spatula.
But with those that are born at the base of the joint, healing is difficult and therefore it is important to avoid cutting them out.
But with those that are born in the nails of the fingers, it is necessary to first make a round incision into the flesh of the nail and then saw through it with a suitable saw, treating what lies beneath until it heals.
But if there is a thickening in the fingers due to swelling or by birth defects, or due to infection or burn, then it is necessary to cut into the thickened tissue until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then wrap them in oiled cloth to prevent quick scarring, and separate the fingers with a thin sheet of lead until they are healed as necessary.
And similarly, if there is thickening in the palm of the hand, then dry out the thickened tissue according to its shape and size.
Regarding incisions for veins, they are varicose veins.
Veins are varicose veins, and they are thickened veins filled with an excess of melancholic fluids that appear in the muscles of various parts of the body, often occurring in the legs, especially among travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore it is necessary to administer purging of the body with black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then perform bloodletting on the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment of varicose veins using iron is done in two ways: one is by making an incision and drawing out the black blood, and the other way is by lifting the vein and extracting it entirely.
The incision should be made in the following way: first soak the leg with warm water to soften the thickened area, then bind the leg of the patient to the upper part of the thigh using a band, and make one, two, or three cuts in the vein using a wide-bladed knife. Then use the thumb of your lower hand to press on the black blood from beneath the incision, squeezing it out until you have removed as much as desired and the patient can bear it.
And then bind it up, and instruct the patient to avoid foods that produce black bile.
Repeat the treatment with bloodletting when the veins are full and this is noticeable for the patient.
But the elevation of varicose veins should be done in this way: first examine the leg of the patient and if there are many bulges, then place them in a bath and soak the leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins become more prominent; or exercise the limb vigorously if no bath is available until it becomes inflamed.
And then dry out the skin next to the vein by making an incision in the long or short direction of it, along the back of the calf or at the base of the foot.
And then use forceps to open the skin and scrape away the vein from all sides until sensation is lost, which will be apparent when the area appears darkened.
And then as it emerges, you will see the white thread that is the vein.
And then place the vein below the skin so that it rises and is separated from it, and suspend it with a golden clasp.
And then dry out another section next to the first one, and use forceps to scrape away the skin above the vein until it appears.
And then raise the vein and cut it in the section behind the ankle, and extract it and lift it until it emerges through the second incision, and then remove it from the section above it.
And do this until you have extracted the vein from the highest or deepest section of all the incisions, so that it is completely removed; and then make another incision.
And if the vein does not obey your attempts to extract and lift it, then insert a double-threaded needle with strong filament and tie it off, extracting it with the needle; or insert a probe beneath it and rotate your hand around it until it is dislodged. And be careful not to cut too deeply, for if the vein is torn, it becomes difficult to lift and may cause harm to the patient.
And when all the vein has been completely removed, then place a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and roasted oil on the wound, and treat the area until it heals.
But if the vein is contracted with twisting and is wrapped around various parts, and not straight as we have said, then it is necessary to make cuts along the entire length of the twisted area and at the wrapping points, and use forceps to lift the vein until it is fully raised.
And be careful not to cut too deeply and avoid damaging the vein, for it will make it difficult to raise; use your discretion in this matter.
The method of cutting the vein is as follows:
It is not as sharp as forceps and does not have a pointed end to avoid damaging the vein; it is made of thick yet flexible gold, for if it were too thin, it would cut into the vein due to its thinness. It has an unnecessary excess thickness, as we have said.
Regarding the removal of veins in the leg:
This vein is generated in the legs, particularly in hot countries such as Al-Andalus in the Arabic lands and in the hot, dry regions of India where there is little vegetation or plant life.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
The formation of this vein is due to the decay that occurs beneath the skin, similar to the venom produced by snakes and worms that breed between the skin and flesh.
The sign of the onset of this vein is a vehement inflammation that occurs in the leg, followed by blistering and the appearance of a small protrusion that resembles the root of a plant.
And when the limb appears, then it is necessary to wrap around that one a pound of lead which weighs between one and two drachmas, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as often as any cause brings it to swell up, cover it again with lead and bind it. And if it becomes too prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise that part which has come to a head yet, because if you incise it at this stage, it will contract and enter into the flesh, causing abscess, pus and a bad ulcer in that area.
Therefore it is necessary to treat it gently and extract it gradually until it has been expelled from the body completely and there remains no cause of it in the body.
And from this vein, it is excreted in some men who are its length of five palms and it has already reached me that one was excreted of twenty palms (i.e., a very long one).
And if it is incised at the time of its medication, then insert the probe into the opening and make a long incision through the body, until everything in the matter has been evacuated, and administer putrefaction to the area for several days with medicines; and then treat it with cure for the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches and is more so when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and comes to it with many openings, and is excreted from each opening.
And therefore treat it in this way as we have said in the division and with what has been mentioned above.
Regarding the incision of worms generated under the skin and it is called "bovine disease."
This illness is called in some lands "our bovine disease" because it often affects cows and is a worm that is barely visible, which is born between the hide and flesh, and moves throughout the body up and down, and manifests itself to sensation by going from member to member until it breaks the skin and emerges.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as with other worms and snakes and earthworms and intestinal parasites in the stomach.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it moves throughout the body and rises to the head and reaches the brain, it easily enters through the ears and destroys the brain, and this happens frequently.
And therefore when you want to cure and extract it, it is not done except by following its movement and appearance to the sensation, and then it is appropriate to strengthen what is above it and below it with pressure and constriction, and dry heat should be applied over it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a hot cautery over the area where it resides until it dies, and the most feared cause of this is its putrefaction, which corrupts the area as we have said.
But if you see that it has reached the head near the ear, then strengthen above the eyebrow with strong constriction and dry heat over it, and extract it; and it is necessary for the patient to undergo a purification of their body with evacuative medicines that eliminate putrid bad humors, and they should be cautious about consuming foods that cause putrefaction.
On the incision of disease caused by nasal polyps (nafir).
This illness is called "nafir" in our land and it is a pain that occurs in certain members and frequently spreads from member to member.
I have already seen this according to what you recommended (i.e., I have observed it). I was called to a sick woman in a village and discovered her arm, and saw a small inflammation in the vein funis of the arm, and after an hour had passed, I saw that inflammation move like a worm rising upwards, but more gently than being visible, appearing like silver flowing from place to place.
And then the pain moved from that location and entered the muscle, and it remained there for about an hour.
And then it moved into the other side of the body until it reached the other arm.
And she reported to me that it traveled throughout her entire body until it reached the other arm, which was remarkable due to its movement and quickness from member to member. And I had already seen something similar in my own experience before that, but I have also observed many instances where pain is moved from one member to another. But I have not seen this with my own feet in the same way as I did with the woman.
And I do not think it was that, but rather due to the fact that the woman was old and had dry limbs and exposed veins, which made her more susceptible to feeling this gaseous movement throughout her body.
And it is necessary that this retro-treatment does not appear in those who are delicate and have warm bodies with dilated veins.
And when you want to treat it and the patient feels this pain, then do not appear in front of them as we have said, instead strengthen above that area slightly and apply gentle pressure below it, while also applying dry heat over it until this constricted gas is expelled from the body, and cauterize the location.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by inducing vomiting in the body and using medicines that expel gas, as well as foul-smelling pills and serapin pills (i.e., made from dried rhubarb root).
On the removal of arrows.
Arrows are varied in their types, depending on the material they are made from and where they strike in the body, as their diversity lies in those that have large tips, small tips, concave tips, blunt tips, solid tips, those with three angles, those with tongues, and those with feathers (i.e., fletching).
And the symptoms of death are when an arrow strikes and passes through bone, exiting near the skull (which is above the brain), causing violent swelling, loss of vision, dizziness, tingling in the limbs, inflammation, and burning sensation of the tongue, spasms, confusion, yellow bile vomit, difficulty speaking clearly, voice loss, white fluid exuding from the wound (similar to fine dust), and clear liquid oozing from the injured area.
And therefore, if you observe these symptoms, then refrain from treating or removing the arrow, unless it is absolutely necessary.
But the symptoms of an arrow striking the heart when it is near the left breast and feels like it has penetrated a hard object, but not deeply enough to reach vital organs, are that the movement of the arrow resembles a pulsating motion, black blood oozes from the wound, limbs become cold and clammy, there is sweating, and fainting spells. And know that death will soon follow in such cases.
And the symptoms when an arrow has injured the lungs are spumy blood from the wound, swelling near the neck, change in the patient's complexion, difficulty breathing loudly, and a strong desire for fresh air.
And if an arrow strikes the fascia (i.e., connective tissue) in the feet and the pain is near the small ribs, then a large and severe swelling occurs with intense discomfort and sighing, affecting all members of the body, but not necessarily causing paralysis or loss of mobility.
And if an arrow pierces the stomach, then quickly give the patient some food to prevent indigestion.
And if an arrow pierces the belly and is lodged in it, then there is a wound or torn flesh, or ruptured intestine, and there is no hope for recovery through extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow pierces the bladder and urine comes out of it, and there is some cause that expels it from within, and quickly pain arises in the patient, then know that it is fatal.
But other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, and shoulder, and the shoulder blades, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the hip, and the leg, and their similar members, are saved according to the greatest dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery, and it is not a poisonous arrow.
And I advise you of what I have seen concerning the nature of these arrows, so that you may understand from this about easy treatment.
The reason is that when an arrow pierces the lacrimal gland in the corner of a person's eye near the nose, and I extract it from the other side while leaving the arrowhead behind the ear lobe, the wound heals, and there is no harm to the eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which pierced his eye and entered the skull behind it, only a small piece of the arrowhead remained visible as it had adhered to its shaft, it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows used by the Turks, with a lion's head but no ear.
And the Jew, there was no significant damage to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man who had been struck in the shoulder, it was an Arabic arrow with two ear-like projections; and then I inserted my fingers on both sides of it, as it was already submerged in his shoulder, and then I skillfully removed it, and the Christian man healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the stomach, and I thought that he would die from it; but after thirty days passed without any change in his condition, I cautiously inserted my fingers around the arrow and gently removed it, and the man healed, and there was no further harm to him.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow pierced his back, and the wound had closed up, but after seven days passed, the arrow came out near his hip.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow pierced her stomach, and the wound had closed up inside of her, and there was no change in her condition for several days, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow pierced his face and the wound had closed up, with the arrowhead broken off, but there was no significant pain or similar cases to this one.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the king's court who had been struck in the middle of his nose and it had tilted slightly to the right side and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called upon to treat him within three days of the arrow piercing him.
And then I examined the arrow wound and found it to be very tight, so I carefully probed with delicate fingers, but did not feel anything; but he felt a pricking sensation behind his right ear, so I suspected that this was due to the tip of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster with attractive and digestive properties to the area, trusting that an abscess would form in the wound, allowing me to locate the arrowhead and dry it out. [An "emplaustre" is a type of medical plaster or poultice used for healing wounds and sores.]
And there was no significant complication at the wound site, indicating that the arrow had not penetrated deeper; I continued to apply the plaster for several days without incident and the wound healed over time. After many days, the patient felt the arrowhead inside his nose and informed me of this.
And then I applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until it became raw, and with careful probing, I found the tip of the arrow that had remained attached to its shaft.
And then I continued to apply the sharp medicine until the arrowhead became visible and emerged from the wound over a period of four months.
And when the wound had healed enough for me to use forceps, I carefully and gently worked on it over time, until one day I was able to securely grasp the arrowhead with the forceps and extract it, after which I treated and restored the wound.
And some doctors believed that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I was able to heal and restore it, and the wound healed completely, the patient was cured without any further complications or harm.
And I advise you of the specifics and nuances of extracting certain arrows, as there are rules and definitions that cannot be fully conveyed through a narrative or captured in this book.
And wise craftsmen compare little to much, and what is present with what is absent, and in the face of unusual causes and effects, they find new methods and tools.
And so I say that arrows are not easily removed from the parts of the body where they have been lodged, but rather only in two ways: either through attraction to the location where it has entered, or by opposing force from the opposite direction.
And an arrow that is removed by attraction to the location where it entered is either a flesh wound arrow, and is drawn out and expelled.
And if it does not easily come out at the time of entry, then you must leave it alone for several days until the surrounding flesh is healed, which will lessen its attraction and make it easier to extract.
And similarly, if it is stuck in bone and does not respond to efforts to extract it, then you should leave it alone for several days and apply traction and motion every day until it is expelled.
And if it still does not respond after several days, then you must carefully drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine tool until the wound is enlarged and the arrow can be extracted.
But if the arrow is lodged deep within the body and cannot be felt, then you must carefully probe for it with your fingers and, if you find it, use appropriate instruments to gently pull it out.
But if you cannot extract it due to the severity of the wound or its depth and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you can make an incision over the wound to enlarge it and facilitate removal. [This statement implies that the surgeon should weigh the risks and benefits of cutting into the body to remove the arrow.]
If the arrow is stuck by its barbs, then carefully cut away the flesh surrounding it from all sides, using all available techniques. And if you cannot extract it without breaking the barbs or twisting them, then do so in order to remove the arrow.
When extracting an arrow, use a twisting motion with your hand and forceps on all sides until it comes out. Be careful to not break the arrow, and use gentle but firm traction to remove it safely.
If you are unable to remove the arrow immediately, then wait for several days until the surrounding tissues become stronger, and try again as the pain and swelling may have decreased by then. But if attempting to remove the arrow causes excessive bleeding, then follow the previously mentioned guidelines for treating bleeding in its own chapter.
And be cautious when probing for the arrow to avoid damaging veins, nerves, or tendons, and use all means necessary to safely remove it, doing so with ease, calmness, patience, and steadiness, as I have recommended.
And therefore, try to extract the arrow in a way that restores the patient's body to its original form and function before the injury, as this is most beneficial. But if you cannot restore the body to its previous state, then do your best with the available methods and techniques.
If the arrow is stuck and cannot be easily removed or if it has already started to protrude from the other side of the wound, or if you can feel the barbs on the outside, then dry the area around the arrowhead and make an incision along its length based on the size that can be grasped with forceps. Then gently pull out the arrow as it will come out easily.
But if the arrow is stuck in bone, then twist it back and forth in the opposite direction until it loosens and starts to come out on its own. Then gently pull it out, enlarging the wound as needed.
If that is not possible, then leave the arrow in place for several days and try again later when the swelling has gone down.
And if part of the arrow shaft is still inside, then push it further in. This may help with removal later on.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to apply pressure, then insert a concave instrument into the wound, such as a spoon, so that it fits around the arrowhead. Then use this tool to push the arrow out with gentle force.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then use a strong instrument to push it out from the inside as this will make it easier to extract.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it's important to cut away all the flesh surrounding the wound if possible and treat it with appropriate medicine.
If the arrow pierces the foot, stomach, bladder, or ribcage and is close enough to touch with your finger, then dry the wound and carefully probe it. If possible, make an incision over the wound and be cautious not to cut into veins or nerves. Extract the arrow and clean the wound before dressing it and allowing it to heal.
Here's a description of forceps used for extracting arrows:
The tips of these forceps resemble bird's beaks, with serrated edges to prevent the arrow from slipping during extraction.
And there are many types of forceps made for different purposes and sizes, depending on the size and shape of the arrowhead, its smallness or largeness, and the width of the wound and the tightness of the surrounding tissues.
Just as one would do to alleviate the contents of an abscess in a concave cavity, it should be emptied with this (instrument).
On bloodletting of veins.[*](In medieval medicine, bloodletting was believed to balance the bodily humors and was a common medical practice.)
The veins commonly used for bloodletting are usually these: .xxx. Of these, there are 16 in the head. There are two pulsatile veins near the ears, which are called "templars"; there are two herbs that appear in these temples; and there are two veins in the lacrimal glands of each eye, which are called "aspicientz". There is also a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead, as well as a vein at the end of the nose. Additionally, there are two veins in the throat, and there are two veins on the upper lip and lower lip. These last four veins are called "algelic". Finally, there are also two veins that are located below the tongue.[*](This passage describes several specific veins throughout the head and neck, some of which may be more recognizable to modern medical practitioners than others.) But the veins that are commonly bled in the arms are five. And of those five, one is the cephalic vein, which is also known as the wild lettuce vein; and people call it "the head vein". It is hidden, and is a minor vein, composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein. People commonly call this vein "the whole body vein", while the basilic vein is the vein that runs in the inner arm, also known as the "citillar" or "belly vein". The funis del bras (forearm vein) is located above the wrist and is the vein that is commonly bled. It appears prominently on the surface of the skin when a tourniquet is applied. The salvatella vein is located between the little finger and the ring finger, and has two branches.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one of them is located below the curve of the little toe, also known as the wild lettuce vein; the second one is the saphenous vein, which is located below the inner thigh or calf muscle; and the third one is the sciatic vein, which is located below the outer thigh or wild lettuce muscle. There are also other similar veins in the leg.[*](This passage describes three major veins in the foot and leg, along with some variations.)
The benefit of bloodletting near the ears is for treating old cases of cephalalgia (headaches), migraines, hemorrhoids, and chronic ulcers on the head.[*](This passage describes some of the specific medical conditions that were believed to be treated by bloodletting near the ears.)
And the manner of bloodletting is as you recommend: begin by shaving the patient's head and then massaging their scalp in the occipital region where both veins are located, using a wide cloth with good friction. Then, bind the patient's neck with a band so that both ears are raised and positioned at two depressed areas on the head. Next, use your finger to locate the veins and if you feel a pulse in those veins, then proceed with bloodletting.
And you take the incisive knife and insert it under the vein in the crook of the arm until the tip of the scalpel reaches the bone. This passage describes how to make an incision for bloodletting, using a sharp knife or lancet to cut into the skin just below the vein and making a small opening for blood to flow out.[*](This suggests that venesection was performed with precision and care, using specialized tools and techniques.) And you lift your hand with the vein and crook of the arm upwards, and then make an incision into the vein using a sharp blade. This passage describes how to make an incision for bloodletting, using a sharp blade or lancet to cut into the skin above the vein and making a small opening for blood to flow out.[*](This suggests that venesection was performed with precision and care, using specialized tools and techniques.) And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; and let blood flow as much as you want.
Then apply a poultice and leave it inside until it is healed.
And at the beginning of this book, the incision and its cauterization have already been addressed.
But of the two veins or arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and persistent headaches, eye ailments, and acute bodily fluids discharged at the hands (feet).
And the method of bloodletting from those veins depends on what you recommend: tighten the patient's neck so that the two veins appear to the touch by clear perception and the pulse is felt below your finger; then, you make an incision.
And you raise the skin above the vein at its divisions with your finger, insert the bloodletting incision below it, and raise the vein upwards; then make an incision in it as you did on the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the quantity of your need.
And loosen the constriction of the patient, place your finger over the vein for an hour, and then place a bandage and poultice over it and hold it in place with strong compression, leaving it inside until it is healed.
And the reminder of them (the veins), and their incision, and the attraction were discussed at the beginning of this book.
And so, the benefit of bloodletting from the vein on the forehead is similar to that of the cephalic vein for chronic diseases of the face, headaches, and fetid ulcers.
And the method of bloodletting from it (the frontal vein) is as you recommend, that is, the patient constricts their neck with a band until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a fossor, which looks like this:
Place the pointed end of the fossor over the vein and strike it with a penchant or another cause in its manner, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; then release the patient's perforation and hold it inside until it is healed.
Sometimes a vein is opened with a broad bloodletting incision, but it is not necessary for the bloodletting to have an acute point like other bloodlettings; rather, let it be without a point and bloodlet laterally, as the bone is near and easily breakable in that area when the bloodletting tool is fine.
But the benefit of the two veins that are by the tear ducts in the corners of the eyes is for skin diseases (scabies) of the hands, headaches, and foot illnesses, as well as facial diseases.
And the method of bloodletting is that the patient constricts their neck with a band, and then you bloodlet those veins while standing over the patient's head.
And the bloodletting incision should be made laterally, slightly elongated with a small incision, as there is no flesh in that area; and if the bloodletting tool is fine, its tip is easily broken.
And then let blood flow according to your need, place a bandage over the incision and hold it in place for one night, and then release the bandage.
But bloodletting from the nasal vein is suitable for acute fevers and violent swelling, as well as facial diseases, headaches that occur in the face, and especially when they are chronic.
And the method of bloodletting from it (the nasal vein) is that the patient constricts their neck and tilts their head back with your left hand supporting it, and then take a thin, long bloodletting tool and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge at a right angle, as the vein does not appear to touch here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
It is necessary that you gradually move your hand with the bloodletting tool and let the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for one night, as it heals quickly.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the two guiding veins is for constriction due to ale (a type of disease), leprosy at its onset, and other diseases such as impetigo and corrosive ulcers like herpetromeno.
And the method of bloodletting from those (the two guide veins) is that the patient constricts their neck below each one with a ligament; and the practitioner stands over the patient's head, while the patient sits on a stool.
And then bloodlet the vein lengthwise with a broad, small bloodletting tool gradually; and extract blood according to the required quantity or as much as you see necessary; and proceed similarly for the other vein.
And then release the ligament and hold both veins with gentle compression to prevent excessive bleeding, and leave it inside during the day as the wound heals.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the Algerian veins is suitable for small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, and fissures, as well as bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the method of bloodletting from those (the Algerian veins) is to have the patient sit in front of you, constrict their neck with a band, and then part their lips and look for two veins, one on each side of the lip; the demonstration of each one is by its dark color, which is more noticeable in small black veins around those areas; and then make an incision for each vein at an angle.
But if you are uncertain, and cannot distinguish between them, then make an incision on the larger of the two veins, and where there is more pus from those.
And proceed similarly for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the two veins that are below the tongue is similar to that of the cephalic vein for swellings in the throat, diseases of the uvula, and mouth illnesses.
And the method of bloodletting from those (veins) is to follow the patient with your hands in front of their neck and under the chin, raise their tongue, look beneath it for two sides of each vein, and notice that the color of each one tends to darken.
And then bloodlet each one, but be careful not to overdo it when bloodletting from those (veins), as there are arteries beneath them.
And the veins that are customarily bloodletted in the groin are those where blood flow is common in all men, and their bloodletting can be done in two ways: either by using a myrtle or olive-tipped bloodletting tool with a fine point; or by drying it with a scalpel-like bloodletting tool called alnessil, and this is its shape:
Let its tip be as you like, and it is appropriate to open the hollow concave veins that appear thick and contain thick blood.
And this bloodletting tool has a smaller width and sharper tip, and is appropriate for bloodletting from fine veins containing subtle yellowish blood.
But the benefit of bloodletting from the basilic vein, one of three veins, is to extract blood from diseases that occur in the throat and neck, as well as those that cause leg and abdominal swelling.
And it is necessary for the bloodletter, when bloodletting from that (vein), to be careful and cautious, as there is an artery beneath it; if they make a mistake and puncture the wrong area with the bloodletting tool, they will cut the artery and cause excessive bleeding. Therefore, it is advisable not to use a sharp bloodletting tool, but rather one that is more blunt, such as alnessil.
And if the blister does not appear by clear observation, then you should move to another spot, or look for a vein; or perform a bloodletting at the end of the arm, since that is obvious; and dry up the one with bloodletting as we have said.
But if you want to perform a bloodletting of the median vein, then you should touch the spot in front of the bend of the arm, where you can feel the pulse, and place your finger on it; and tie off the arm and dry up the vein with a concave section using bloodletting as we have said; and be careful that the percussion is not heard for some distance from the location of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the spot that you marked with your finger, then that swelling is a swelling of the artery, and so avoid it.
And if you see the blood flow in the bloodletting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin red, then you know that it is arterial blood; and so you should place your hand and press on that area for some distance; and then remove your hand, and if the bleeding has stopped, since it often stops, then you should tighten the arm and let it be.
And beware of the patient's phlegm, and be cautious around them, and do not harm them for several days until they are healed.
But if the bleeding does not stop, and you do not have the necessary medicine at hand, then you should cut the artery, if it is visible; for the extremity is contracted, and the blood has stopped flowing; or take a piece of raw flesh, and make an incision in it, and take a piece of meat and tighten it over the location of the vein with a ligature and with a bandage for several days.
And so if the bleeding has stopped, that is good; and if not, then you should cure it with what is mentioned before in reference to the location of the powder for stopping the flow of blood.
And the incision for stopping the bleeding is difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of arm constriction.
But an incision of the lesser saphenous vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, it is composed of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious in performing a bloodletting of the lesser saphenous vein, because below it there is a nerve; and so if it touches the nerve during the incision, then the patient will become stupefied, and healing will be difficult and often incomplete. And this nerve is sensitive to touch; and if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and not noticeable, then it is necessary to perform the bloodletting with a small incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should make an incision along its length.
The benefit of bloodletting from the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and alleviates diseases of the hands.
And it is necessary in this case, if you want to perform a bloodletting with an olive-shaped incision or a myrtle-shaped incision; because it is the safest for all veins, as it does not touch the artery or nerve.
But it is quite rare for some people to develop an abscess if they are not bled in the first percussion, but this is not noticed at all.
The first of those is that you should know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health and as a precaution against the onset of diseases, and it should be performed on one of the veins in the cubital fossa, which are: cephalic, lesser saphenous, and basilic; and that bloodletting should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime when signs of plethora appear.
And bloodletting should be performed on the third day or at the earliest after three hours have passed from sunrise.
But bloodletting that is administered, but only when it is appropriate and necessary, whether at night or during the day, at any hour and in all seasons.
And it is necessary that a child should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be bled unless she is in her fourth to seventh month, and the elderly should not be bled if they have already passed sixty years of age.
And when someone wants to be bled in any way, it is necessary that they clean their intestines before the bloodletting with an enema of lion's claw if there is a lot of retained feces in them, so that the veins do not draw impure superfluities into the bloodletting of the intestines, which are pure, and do not pollute the main members.
And patients with sacred nausea and hangovers should not be bled until their condition has improved, nor those suffering from illness or intoxication, nor those with dropsy, and bloodletting should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, excessive exercise or fasting, vigils, or any cause that weakens the vital force, whether it is physical or mental.
And also consider the refinement of humors beforehand if the blood is thick, through diet and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible for that.
And also enter into a bath if no contrary cause prohibits it, or engage in exercise to refine the blood.
And perform the bloodletting on the feet at the hour of terce, as we have said.
And make sure that the feet are protected from all harmful animals on that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as diarrhea, excessive exertion, pain, and similar conditions.
And at their bedside, let there be present the causes for which they are accustomed to use aromatics and fragrances and balms, according to their quantity of possibility.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be bled.
And let them extend their arm, and rub it with their own hand several times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the ligature be moderate, because if the ligature is too tight or there is excess ligature, then it prohibits blood flow; or if it is loose, then it prevents the body from releasing blood.
And when the ligature is applied, it is necessary that the one who is to be bled rubs their hands together between them so that the veins become inflated and are made more prominent to the touch.
And the phlebotomist anoints their lancet with a little antiseptic oil properly; and then places the index finger of their left hand on that vein, below the location where they want to make the incision, so that the vein moves slightly away and the percussion is lessened because it is the vein that one finds as if it were a cord when making the incision, and those are full of airiness and when you place the lancet on them, they contract; and when the phlebotomist makes the incision, they reveal the vein, and if they open it, it is narrow.
Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be steady and attentive in all these matters.
And then let the phlebotomist wait, but if the vein is not found in a location, then that is good; and if not, you should try another vein below that area slightly, or hasten it a bit if the place is not abscessed.
And if the location is gangrenous, or the patient is feverish, then you should leave it alone for a day or two and do not bind it tightly, because it will quickly draw gangrene to the wound, nor should they enter the bath.
And perform bloodletting if necessary.
And if the aperture is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will be released, then you should perform bloodletting in that vein according to what is proper and adjust the aperture slightly, and do this quickly before the location becomes gangrenous, because in many cases where the location becomes gangrenous, only a little blood needs to be released.
But if you see that it is already gangrenous, then do not perform bloodletting on it, because it will not be of any help; and place some part of the wound near the incision with oil, because this will alleviate the body of blood. And in this case, oil is better than other oils.
And similarly, apply an incision of oil in every bloodletting where you incise veins, according to the prohibition of bleeding; and do this with theriac taken from a physician and sage wine when it is applied on one side of that on the location, because the blood will be thinned and will flow more easily when it is thick.
And if in the location of the bloodletting, a large abscess is generated, because many times this happens, especially in those who have not been bled before or in the case of an incision on a small vein; then you should bind and place on the location a sponge soaked in warm water and salt for an hour, because this will dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this at the onset of the blood flow from that vein, or from another vein.
And if blackness or greenness remains in the location for several days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, place on it some remedy of aloe and myrrh dissolved, or a remedy of mint juice or chamomile, or similar things.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur, which should be treated with bloodletting in the basilic vein.
And therefore place your hand on it, and if you find softness, then increase the pressure on that location; because in this case, the swelling is harmful and bad; and so be careful to place some remedy on it as we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And apply a poultice with something that has styptic properties, so that the location will harden; and care for it with other treatments until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from every person according to the quantity of their strength and according to the color that prevails in the blood, as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you should let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick, then you should let it flow until it becomes thinned; and similarly, if it is acrid, then you should let it flow until the sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for a person who is fat and strong and requires bloodletting in one location, that the incision of the vein be enlarged and the bloodletting be broad.
And for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in multiple locations, and the incision should be narrow.
And the best method for bloodletting from a vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and nerve injury, and it is more commendable and safer than bloodletting according to length and width.
And for the person who is accustomed to fainting after bloodletting, it is necessary that you care for them beforehand with a piece of bread infused in wine of millet or simple oxymel warmed; and extract a little more blood in three or four locations.
And if they are chilled due to their complexion, then before bloodletting, give them bread infused in myrrh or honeyed water scented with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar things, or in scented and fragrant honeyed water.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting due to the loss of a large amount of blood, then it is necessary for them to drink water with meat and subtly scented honeyed water; and use aromatics such as aloe, and apply linen bandages to their chest.
And use the other causes that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on fainting for evacuation.
And for the person who wants to relieve their arm and dissolve their blood gradually, it is necessary that the bloodletting be performed on the vein in multiple locations, and the strength of this person be weak; let the blood flow gradually according to their strength on consecutive days.
But for the person who wants to relieve their arm and remove their blood again, and their body is strong, then they should do this seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But for the person who wants to draw the blood from their body in the opposite direction of the location where it is flowing, then they should perform evacuation on the second or third day. [**Note: This translation is based on a text that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and slightly to French as well, so some phrases may not be an exact match with modern English.]
But for the body that has a large amount of coagulated blood and is inflamed and causing fever, it is necessary to remove a large quantity of blood in one location and widen the incision so as to induce fainting; and you should place your hand on the patient's pulse near the site of the bleeding, so that they will not die from fainting, because this often happens when the practitioner is ignorant or negligent.
And it is not necessary when you want to relieve the arm and remove blood gradually, as the orifices of the vein are closed and making the flow of blood difficult, that you press hard on top of it, bending it and extending it slightly, because this is very harmful.
Instead, you should leave it alone until it can be bloodlet again; or remove the coagulated blood in the vein's orifices with a second bloodletting, maintaining the sharpness of the incision; or place on it some remedy such as theriac plaster or sage wine, and apply gentle pressure until all the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is gangrenous, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the gangrene has subsided.
And if necessity compels you to perform bloodletting again and it is not contraindicated, then you should bleed the patient on that location or in the other arm on another vein.
And the vein called "the cord of the arm" is bloodletting instead of the cephalic or basilic vein when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of bloodletting on the patient is that they place their hand in warm water until the finger becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
And then bind it firmly with moderate tension; and perform the incision transversely, not longitudinally or broadly. [**Note: This translation is based on a text that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and slightly to French as well, so some phrases may not be an exact match with modern English.]
And make the incision wide and make your bloodletting on that vein over the joint of the hand slightly.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you should place your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it until you have achieved your necessary amount.
But if it is summertime, then you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water, and in wintertime, the body should be placed in warm water during bloodletting instead.
And the bloodletting from this vein is safer than any other veins because there are no pulsating veins or nerves below it.
And the bloodletting from the small vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of bloodletting on this vein is that you bind the hand with a bandage or your hand, after it has been placed in warm water, until the vein becomes swollen and clearly visible; then perform the incision transversely; and if it goes slightly deeper, it will not harm.
And be careful not to cut too deeply with the bloodletting instrument, because the nerves of the fingers below it are devoid of flesh.
And then immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not immerse it, the blood will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, which is forbidden to occur.
And when sufficient blood has been extracted according to the necessary amount, then you should apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent clotting; and similarly, it is important that all incisions be made narrowly.
But the benefit of bloodletting from this vein in the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform similarly in the bloodletting from this vein as you have done with the other.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, and menstrual retention, and for diseases of the joints and ancient ulcers of the thighs and hips, and similar diseases. [**Note: This translation is based on a text that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and slightly to French as well, so some phrases may not be an exact match with modern English.]
And the quality of bloodletting from this vein is that the patient places their foot in warm water and performs friction until the veins become visible; and they bind the area above the ankle with a bandage; and locate the vein at the apparent location on the top of the foot, and follow its branches along the side of the foot.
And therefore perform bloodletting in a wide location below the calf near the ankle because it is better and safer.
And if you perform bloodletting on the side of the foot, then be careful not to cut the nerves that are below it; and make your incision transversely, as if you wanted to cut it slightly.
And let the incisions be small.
But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you should immerse the foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until sufficient blood has been extracted.
But if the practitioner errs in the first attempt, then you should make another incision slightly above it because the location is safe; and do not be afraid of making a mistake, but rather take care to avoid cutting the nerves as we have mentioned.
And similarly, do the same for the saphenous vein in the other foot as well. [**Note: This translation is based on a text that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and slightly to French as well, so some phrases may not be an exact match with modern English.]
And the location for bloodletting from the sciatic vein is below the calf near the ankle on the outside of the leg.
And the benefit of bloodletting from this vein is for pain in the hip caused by coagulated blood.
And the quality of bloodletting from this vein is that the patient enters a bath and quickly binds their thigh with a long thin band above the calf near the ankle in one spot with a single band, so that it is not visible.
And therefore when it appears, then you should perform bloodletting from that vein as much as possible and transversely, because this is better; or cut slightly into the skin or make a deep incision in order to draw more blood, because the location of the vein is safe.
And in many people it is quite small; and if you find it and do not feel its entirety, then make the incision on a branch of it, which appears on the back of the foot near the little finger and ring finger.
And be careful not to cut nerves, and let blood flow in the quantity that you desire.
And then loosen any tightness and place a dressing on the location of the incision, binding it gently so that it heals lightly.
On bloodletting and the methods of using it.
Leeches are used for veins, or for abscesses, or for inflammation.
Bloodletting is done in two ways: one way is through incision and extraction of blood, and the other way is bloodletting without incision.
And this bloodletting that is without incision is done in two ways: either with fire or without fire.
And the leeches that are administered with incision and extraction of blood are placed in 14 locations on the body: the first location is the nape of the neck, which is at the back of the head; the second location is between the two parts of the collarbone; the third location is under the chin below the jaw and mouth; the fourth location is between two spatulas; the fifth location is on the liver, which is above the buttock; the sixth location is on both temples, which are two hand-spans from the ears; the seventh location is on both knees.
And bloodletting does not extract blood from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not diminish their power as much as bloodletting by phlebotomy; nor is it necessary to apply bloodletting with or without fire to any illness caused by repletion until the entire body is evacuated.
But if necessity demands bloodletting for illness or for repletion, it should be administered at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, in the middle location and at some other times as well.
And therefore, when any of those causes are present, and especially during the third or middle phase of the month, it is recommended that bloodletting be performed after two or three hours have passed from midday.
And the benefit of bloodletting on the nape is that when it is used for heaviness in the head and for swelling in the feet, it is necessary to follow this with complete evacuation of the body.
And this bloodletting location is at the phlebotomy site of the cephalic vein.
And it is not allowed to use bloodletting for someone who has a complexion that is too cold or for someone with a catarrh, as this would cause great harm.
And therefore it is not appropriate to use bloodletting for the elderly, especially if they have weak heads or illnesses.
But for someone who falls into a forgetful state after bloodletting, it is necessary to instruct the bloodletter to gently remove their hand from the leech after it has been removed from the body, in order to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But bloodletting on the spine is at the phlebotomy site of the fusca and basilica veins, and it is used for asthma, constriction of the airways, hoarseness, cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary to gently insert the spinal leech, because if it is placed too deep, it can cause weakness in the body and stomach.
The bloodletting on the temples (alhagdahan) is used for temporary pains in the head and eye diseases, migraines, dizziness, and toothaches, and it is performed at the phlebotomy site of the basilic vein.
And it is necessary to instruct the bloodletter not to press too hard with incision, so as not to cut the artery and cause excessive bleeding of blood.
Bloodletting below the chin (dejos le mento) is used for boils in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar ailments in the mouth, and it is performed at the phlebotomy site on the two lips (aliheric).
But the bloodletting performed between two spatulas (doas spatulas) is used for congestion of heat, which is done for excess heat in the body.
The bloodletting performed between the two parts of the temples (doas partidas dedintz dels focils) provides relief from phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilic, fusca and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those smaller veins lead to the larger veins, thereby facilitating the flow to the three main veins.
And instruct the bloodletter not to proceed too much in incision, because the location is stripped of flesh and nerves and arteries lie beneath it.
And this is one type of leeching where the leech is applied on the haunches, and it is useful for hemorrhoids in the buttocks and deep-seated ulcers.
And it is necessary to instruct the bloodletter to use a large leech and that it should be of earthworm type because the location requires strong suction, and fine and easily detached leeches should be used with incision.
But leeches of the thighs should be small and few in number due to their delicate nature, because they draw blood from throughout the body and are useful for old pains in the lungs and chest, and in the bladder; they provoke menstruation and are useful for bothersome coughs and breathing difficulties; and they are located at the phlebotomy site of two saphenous veins, and the external iliac vein, and of two knees.
However, they weaken the entire body and cause fainting spells in some men.
And the benefit of leeches on the external iliac vein is similar to the benefit of leeches on two thighs.
And the quality of the placement of the leeches is that they should be placed initially with the head facing upwards and allowed to suction gently, without prolonging their position, but rather placing them lightly, and removing them slowly, so that the humors come to the location through natural means. And do not cease to repeat and continue until you see the place turn red and swell and the heat of the blood appear.
And then make an incision and gradually increase suction, and consider the disposition of the body.
For a person with tender flesh who is easily prone to wounds, it is necessary to make just one incision and not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
And command the person performing the suction to enlarge the incision and deepen it slightly, while easing up on the suction.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make two incisions, because in the first incision the pathway for the suction of the blood and its watery substance will be opened up. And in the second one, carefully seek out the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very viscous, then make a third incision to reach the end of it.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood slowly or in small amounts, one incision will suffice for us.
And if we want to extract a large amount of blood, make many incisions; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make deeper incisions.
And the limit of incision is the depth of the skin only.
And if the skin of the person is thick, hard, dark, and their pores are tight, then it is necessary that the areas where the suction cups will be placed are smeared with milder, more open oils; in summer, use aloe oil or violet oil, or donkey milk oil, or chamomile oil, and in winter use narcissus oil, lily oil, camomile oil, or blood-like oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is abundant and thick, then use oils that are bitter, such as myrrh oil, or balm of Gilead oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
But if the person performing the suction has large pores and tender skin, then it is forbidden to use oil, and instead, the areas where the suction cups will be placed must be washed with warm water or cold water from a solar still, or donkey milk, or Bordeaux water, and similar ones.
And for a person whose blood is very moist, wash the suction cups with sour wine, or with water from myrtle and sumac, and similar ones.
And for someone whose excess is abundant, wash the suction cups with old wine, or with water from savory, which is marjoram, or from a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar ones.
And it is necessary that suction be performed before bathing; and it should be administered immediately after bathing for an hour or two, and it is necessary to sleep immediately after suction.
What is necessary for the person who will undergo cupping or bloodletting before the procedure?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the person performing cupping or bloodletting has a choleric temperament and tends to cause sharp and inflammatory bleeding, then it is necessary to take cooling measures, such as sour grapes, endive with sour wine and lettuce, scammony, julep, and similar ones.
And give them food such as chicken, and bird meats, and foods seasoned with acids, and similar ones.
And for someone whose complexion is cold, it is necessary to take in drinks such as oxymel of alkanet seeds, and sumac, and mildly aromatic wine between vinegar and honey; and it is recommended that they eat and drink sparingly, and avoid foods such as chicken, rabbit, cheese, fish, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, they drink more than they eat.
And it is necessary to give certain people before cupping or bloodletting drinks such as theriaca and mithridate, or medicines containing musk, such as nutmeg, or aloe, in order to comfort the main parts of the body and make the blood thinner; and they should not take any purgatives.
But the suction cups that are used for incisions should be placed on the liver, spleen, gout, and over the navel, on the joints, and on the bladder of the groin, because these parts of the body cannot tolerate incisions.
And it is not appropriate for those parts to be cut, but rather suction cups should be placed on the body to draw blood from a specific area, such as placing a cup on the breast in cases of bleeding from the nipples or nose; and this method is used to dissolve cold and viscous windiness in the body, such as placing a cup on the stomach or navel; because this rarefies the body part and scrapes it, removing pain and resolving windiness.
And it is also placed on boils when they occur in their eruption or growth, because by the virtue of strong attraction, it easily draws out pus and removes the growth from its place.
And similarly, it works when placed on the liver or spleen to draw out windiness that is trapped in those organs.
And these suction cups are administered either with suction only, or in some cases with fire.
Sometimes they are administered full of thick water in illnesses of the spleen.
And that is why the vein is filled and becomes larger, it is just water with boiled herbs added to it that are suitable for this purpose.
The method of administering a blister with fire: the width of the opening should be two fingers wide, as we have made it; and the quantity of liquid should be the size of a palm; and it should be in the middle of the person, in the area that is in the circuit, the same size as them, the hole should be small according to how much can enter it, the size of a needle.
It should be made of iron or citrus wood, with wide and thick edges, like a lion's paw, smooth and polished so that it does not harm the member even when it is placed on top of it.
And there should be a horizontal iron or metal bar in the middle of it, where a candle with fire is placed.
And this blister should be larger than the one we recommended earlier, and smaller than that according to the illness and the condition of the person using it.
And the blisters for infants and weak people are different from those for young and healthy people.
And the method of applying this blister with fire to the body is as follows: extend a piece of cloth or dry wood in front of a small candle made of wax, and place it on the middle of the crossbar in the middle of the area where the blister will be created, so that the fire is lit around the edges, but not directly on the patient's skin.
And then it should be placed on the patient's body, with the finger over the hole that we mentioned, until the moment when the blister is created and there is no need to press the finger or apply more heat, at which point the blister will quickly dissolve.
And then use fire as appropriate to the situation, and repeat the process if necessary.
However, in the case of a blister that is administered for pleurisy using water, without a crossbar or hole, it should not be applied with force, but rather filled with water and placed on the body part gently.
And this is the method of creating such a blister: The larger the blister, the better it is, as it can hold more water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not used on large body parts but rather on small ones where blisters cannot be applied due to their size, such as the mouth and gums or similar areas, or on bare flesh, such as the nose and similar areas.
And the best way to use leeches is to find them in clean, stagnant water that is rich in nutrients.
And it is best to let them fast for a day and a night in clean water before use, so that there are no impurities left in their stomachs. In the beginning of treatment, they should be emptied through bloodletting or blistering. The affected limbs should then be rubbed until they turn red, after which leeches can be placed on them.
And when they are full, they will fall off by themselves.
And if possible, it is better to use suction cups on the affected area for additional benefit.
If not, wash the area with sour vinegar and then rinse it with clean water. Gently rub and press the affected area to help stimulate blood flow.
If the bleeding from the leeches continues for too long and they release some kind of residue, then take a piece of cloth and soak it in cold water, and place it on top until the residue is absorbed.
If the bleeding increases too much, then sprinkle vitriol trisulphate or other stiptic substances on top until the bleeding stops; or place warm bean pods over the affected area and leave them there until they dry out and fall off, after which the bleeding will stop.
And if necessary, it may be repeated with new leeches when the old ones have fallen off.
If the use of leeches is prohibited or not possible, then rub the affected area with fresh blood or insert a needle into it until it starts to bleed. Once this is done, apply the suction cups as normal, as they will detach themselves once they detect any bleeding.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little bit of aloe trisulphate, salt, or ash on top of them and they will quickly fall off.
And so begins the third section of this text, which deals with restoration. This chapter is very important in the practice of medicine and deals with the restoration of bone fractures and dislocations caused by accidents.
My son, be aware that many ignorant doctors and uneducated healers boast of their knowledge in this chapter without ever having read the works of ancient scholars or even one letter from those texts.
And for this reason, the knowledge of these scholars has been lost in our land, and I have not forgotten it at any time; rather, I have relied solely on my extensive reading of ancient texts and careful study of their meaning, until I extracted the science from those works myself.
And I have continued to explore and study these ideas throughout my life, in order to deepen my understanding of them.
I have described in this chapter everything that comprises my knowledge and experience in this field; however, I have condensed and summarized it for your benefit, so as to save you from the burden of lengthy explanation and provide a concise overview instead. At the end of this summary, I will also demonstrate various forms of medical instruments used in these procedures, as I did in the preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
A summary and compilation of information regarding bone fractures, including the necessary preliminary considerations before beginning to discuss specific broken bones and their treatments. Therefore, it is appropriate to begin this chapter with a summary of the main points that will be discussed. These are the topics that every practitioner should understand before beginning their study of this noble art, whether they are learning from me or from another qualified teacher.
Therefore, I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or swelling occurs, it is necessary to begin with phlebotomy or leeching, or both together, if no contraindications exist, such as debility of strength, infancy, old age in decrepitude, or during times of intense heat or cold.
And let the patient be content with a diet of fresh herbs and bird meat or crustaceans; and prohibit heavy meats and filling up on food or drink that clogs the veins with blood, until you are sure that there is no risk of abscess or if there is no fear of effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to their usual regimen, as they were accustomed to before becoming ill.
Therefore, when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient eat nutritious foods that are rich and heavy in viscosity, such as breads made from wheat cooked with water, rice, beans, peas, beef, poultry, fresh fish, thick wines, and similar items. With this regimen, the coagulation of fractures occurs more easily and quickly.
And know that the shattered bones in men who are either very young or very old cannot continue to be united and consolidated according to their nature, due to the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature assists and helps to heal the broken bone in every way possible, similar to glue, where there is a thick substance that adheres and strengthens what is inside so that it becomes consolidated and remains together until the end of its strength and firmness, as long as no cause prevents it from doing so, just like fire at the beginning.
And for this reason, it is necessary to restrict the patient's diet to foods that are not heavy or viscous and of thick consistency, as we have mentioned.
And know that the types of fractures are different according to the different parts of the body, for a fracture in the leg bone is different from a fracture in the skull, and a fracture in the arm bone is different from a fracture in the spine, and similarly, all other bones are different from one another.
I will now recall all types of fractures, explained in their own separate chapters and distinguished from each other.
There are many different types of fractures within themselves. And the types of bone fractures are differentiated within themselves, for some are curved or angular, others are transverse or longitudinal according to the length of the bone. There are also comminuted, splintered and fragmented fractures that protrude and do not protrude, similar to a pen when it is prepared for writing. There is also a fracture with a wound and disruption in the skull, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for each type of fracture, there is a specific remedy or torment in healing it, as will be recalled separately in their respective places.
There are several signs of bone fractures. And a bone fracture is recognized by its crookedness and protrusion, as well as the sensation of it when touched, and the feeling of it when pressed with one's hand.
And therefore, if there is no visible crookedness or protrusion and when touched, it does not feel different or cause great pain in the patient, then it is not a fracture.
It is possible that there may be crookedness or a small fissure, in which case it is not necessary to touch or apply pressure to the area, but rather to pause and administer one of the medicines that will be recalled at that moment, which is suitable for that location, and also to apply a gentle but firm bandage.
And know that when the area is curved but not split in two or protruding, like a swelling of the entire affected part, then it is necessary to begin at once to straighten it out, as long as there is no abscess present.
And if an abscess is present, then leave it for several days until it subsides, and then treat it in any way possible with lightness and ease.
And know that the healing of a fracture and the union of its parts is easier than the healing of a broken bone, where there is comminution.
And strengthen it with whatever remedy is recalled at that moment.
But if the bone is shattered, then it is necessary to extend the fractured member in two parts, whether it is the arm or leg, using one's hand if the limb is small, or with two ropes or one rope and one's hand if the limb is large.
And ensure that your position is such that you align the limb properly while its parts are extended, then make sure to perform gentle manipulations to return the fragments to their proper places.
And be careful not to cause pain or injury to the patient during your operation, and use your strength to bring the one bone fragment together with its companion in the best possible alignment.
And it is necessary that you touch the area with your hand at that time and correct any deviation that you see, adjusting it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid violent extension and compression, just as foolish doctors often cause abscesses or contractures in the limb through their operation, as we have seen many times before.
And the quality of the bandage for the limb at rest is as recommended; for you should know that broken limbs are differentiated in their smallness and largeness, and in the shape of those parts.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and finger, it is necessary that the wrapping be of very fine fabric.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, it is necessary that the wrapping be thick and firm, for a thick bandage holds together the large and strong member with even pressure, preventing any impurities from entering the area.
And begin by applying a proper and gradual traction to the area of the fracture with three or four layers of bandages, depending on the size of the limb, while gently but firmly holding the bandage in place with your hand.
And then come to the upper part of the area of the fracture and apply less tension than the tightness with which you have bound the site of the fracture. And then gradually extend the bandage away from the site of the fracture and loosen the tension little by little until you reach a large portion of it.
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area with a bandage, extending it to the lower part of the fracture; and make sure that your operation in terms of tension and loosening of this bandage is consistent with what was said for the first bandage.
And then leave space between the layers of soft fabric or cloth that is evenly wrapped around the crookedness of the fracture, if there is any crookedness; and do not leave any gaps if there is none. [translation] E sapias que tota la operacio de cautero es perillosa e fortanha: ayssi cum es l’incisio de aquel en lo loc del membre e la cauterizacio de lu, las quals cove que sia fagas amb prudencia e sens perill.
And then place another bandage over it, and then bind them together properly made splints if there is no inflammation or abscess in the area. If there is an abscess present, leave it alone for several days until it subsides, then apply the splints. [translation] E aprop pausa sobre lu autra benda, e aprop enguala sobre aquestas envolucios stelhas decentment faytas tantost, si en le loc no es imflacio o apostema caut, e lahoras pausa sobre lu aquo que sede le apostema aquel e que oste la imflacio; e layssa aquela per alcus jorns; e lahoras tu strenh sobre lu las stelhas.
And let the splints be made of strong cane or carefully fashioned wood, such as pine or palm fronds. The width of each splint should correspond to this shape and size.
However, it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be slightly larger and thicker than the other splints, and its length should correspond to the size of the limb. Then wrap another bandage around the splints with a tension similar to your first wrapping, and then bind them together securely with twine, as we have said before, tightening it more near the fracture site and less further away from it.
And it is necessary that the twine be moderate in thickness and fineness, and made of flax. If the twine is too thick, as I have seen some foolish doctors use rope instead of twine, it can lead to uneven tension, which is a grave error.
And it is also not appropriate to use very thin twine because you will not be able to achieve the desired tension with them, and there should not be a gap of more than one finger width between splints.
And if the patient complains of pain in the areas where the splints meet their skin, then place a layer of soft fabric or red wool under those areas to prevent injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a disruption in the skin. I will discuss this type of fracture in its own chapter according to its unique characteristics.
And know that not every broken member is straightened with stitches on the first day; this is because a large member does not require that you place it on stitches but rather wait 2-7 days, according to your certainty of the occurrence of cautious abscess.
And this is the method of making poultices with which the ancients treated fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Method of poultice for the healing of fractures, suitable for many complexions and particularly for women and children, as it does not generate heat or friction: take some powder from a mortar, which is the medulla (marrow) of flour that remains after the movement of the millstone against the walls of the mill.
And similarly, if it is chamomile, sieve it with egg white and make the composition not too thick or fine, and then use that.
Another way to make an ointment for the restoration of fractures, dislocations and twists: take assafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, migrach (wild marjoram), all equal to one drachma; myrrh and aloe each equal to five drachmas; aloe equal to twenty drachmas. They should be crushed and sifted, then mixed with either almond oil or egg white if the patient's complexion is dry. And then use this ointment, for it has a good composition and restores broken bones easily, it also benefits many people.
Another way to make an ointment that helps with fractures and twists: take migrach (wild marjoram), white mallow each equal to one drachma; myrrh and aloe each equal to five drachmas; acacia six drachmas, Armenian bole twenty drachmas.
All of these ingredients should be ground in a mortar with the appropriate pestle, sieved, and mixed with water or egg white, and then administered.
Method of poultice for joints and bones that are dislocated from their proper places, and relieves pain and heals cracks and fractures: take soft wool, soak it in vinegar and olive oil, and place it on the affected area.
But this poultice does not have the virtue of restoring bones or causing abscesses to form and driving out pain directly.
Another method of poultice that heals broken bones: take leaves from a wild poppy tree and leaves from a fig tree, grind them together and make a poultice with them.
Method of poultice for quick healing of fractures and promoting resolution of abscess remnants: take equal parts of mallow root, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, barley flour, all mixed together in equal amounts. All of these ingredients should be ground together and mixed with wine if the member (body part) is not rough or inflamed.
But if it is rough or inflamed, then use this poultice made with quince water or plain water and apply it.
Another method of poultice that is even stronger for resolving abscesses when a hard abscess occurs during the healing process: take equal parts of mallow root, linseed, black nightshade, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile flowers, all ground together and mixed with water from a holly tree or plain water or wine, depending on the quality of the member and its color.
But Hippocrates does not say in his book that a poultice should be placed on the broken member during its healing process, but rather recommends using a wax made of wax and oil, and nothing else; and he advises that it should be moderate between thickness and thinness.
But Galen sees that poultices should be placed on the broken member during its healing process and recommends using those made from drying ingredients with a little heat, similar to myrrh, resin, and other such substances, as we have previously recommended.
Method of poultice that benefits injury and pain: take half as much dried figs, human hair cut short or bird feathers, mallow root, and salt, all mixed together in equal amounts, ground and sieved, and made into a poultice.
But the amount of time that the poultice should remain on the affected area depends on whether pain, inflammation, or fracture has occurred, and if the bone is not out of place, then it is not harmful to leave it on for several days. And if pain, inflammation, or swelling occurs at the site of application, then you should remove or loosen the poultice immediately and take it off.
And take a piece of cloth and a wet marine sponge, soak them in warm water, and use these to gently wash the affected area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved; then let the member rest for an hour; and place soft wool soaked in vinegar, olive oil, or rose oil on it, and bind it with a bandage for one night until you are certain that there will be no abscess formation, and that the inflammation of the member has decreased, and the pain has been relieved.
And then gently massage the affected area with a fine poultice and apply it lightly without causing further constriction, and use a finer poultice as the injury heals.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have completely healed, and no further poultice or massage is needed, then continue with the same treatment as you did at the beginning, in equal amounts.
And if none of the symptoms that we have mentioned occur in the affected body part, then you should not remove the poultice for three to four days or up to five or seven days. And sometimes all of this is left in place for 20 days, depending on your assessment of when the member can be unbound, as we have said, until the fracture has healed and the flesh has begun to grow back over it.
And then adjust the poultice so that it is thicker than the initial poultice, and adjust the amount of food given to the patient based on their recovery, as previously mentioned.
But if you see that the site of the fracture has become dry and withered more than is necessary, then know that nutrition is unable to reach that area; and so wet it with warm water every time you change the poultice; and do this for three days; and slightly reduce the pressure of the poultice, and through this action nourishment will be able to reach the affected area, and it will heal more easily.
But some foolish healers of fractured members who are unable to restore the bone to its original position at the beginning make another mistake, as they attempt to correct the problem by forcing the bone into a twisted position, which is dangerous and should be avoided. If they had acted correctly in the first place, the ancients would have praised their methods and considered them skilled practitioners.
And I have never seen anyone do this, which is why it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter two: On fracture when it happens in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by a blow with force, and this blow breaks the bone all the way through to the other side, which is below the bone, similar to what happens in a stick, and this type is called a complete fracture. Or the force drives a part of the bone outward, and it also drives out some flesh but does not pass through to the other side; and this type of fracture is called an incomplete fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures is great or small, and in the case of a contusion or abrasion, it is caused by blows with sand or falling onto a hard surface, similar to this.
And this fracture is either penetrating, reaching the periosteum which is below the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two types of fractures can be great or small.
And there is a type of fracture that occurs in the bone along the thinness of a hair, and for this reason it is called this type "hairline fracture".
And there is a type of fracture that occurs either by falling or by blows with stones, causing a piece of bone to penetrate into the surrounding tissues, and this happens in a concave area similar to what happens to earthenware pots when they are struck and pieces break off and penetrate into the surrounding area.
And this is most often done in the bones of warm-blooded animals, such as the heads of infants.
And all these types of fractures are treated in the same way, like separate pieces of stars or fragments. I will come back to summarize everything in its place. (This sentence suggests that the text is not complete and there might be more information about fractures and their treatment coming up later.)
And let us recognize all these types of fractures through examination and investigation by touch, and by removing any damaged flesh that is on top of them.
And the "hairline fracture" is recognized by this: that it appears on top of the bone and is noticeable because it has been scraped or cleaned off, and a black mark can be felt upon touch, indicating the presence of the fracture.
And in the treatment of fractures, one must consider at the beginning the symptoms of the patient, and if one sees through these symptoms that it clearly indicates fear, such as vomiting of bile, or extension (of limbs), or loss of consciousness, or loss of voice, or fainting, or acute fever, or discharge from the ears and nose and similar symptoms in severe cases, then do not proceed with treatment until these have passed. [**Note**: This is a very important principle in medieval medicine - that the physician should carefully consider the patient's overall condition before deciding on a course of treatment. The text specifically mentions "accidents" or symptoms that indicate fear (and perhaps shock) which could be caused by the trauma of the fracture itself, and it advises against proceeding with treatment until these have passed. This is good medical advice even today - in trauma cases, it is important to stabilize the patient before proceeding with any invasive procedures.**]**
And if you do not see any alarming symptoms, then you may begin the treatment of the fracture.
The reason for this is that if the patient has come to you in the beginning stages of the fracture (and this is usually in the winter months), then it is necessary to wait 14 days before operating on the bone, according to all circumstances.
But if it is in the summer months, then it is necessary to operate on the bone before the seventh day, but only if what is below the bone (i.e., the periosteum) has not become corrupted by pus, and unless the alarming symptoms that I mentioned earlier have appeared. [**Note**: This is very interesting - the text seems to suggest that in warmer months, fractures should be treated more quickly than in colder months. This may reflect the fact that bone healing takes longer in the winter (due to reduced blood flow and other factors), but also that there is a greater risk of infection during the summer due to the presence of bacteria and other pathogens in the air and on the skin.**]**
And if the fracture has reached and affected the periosteum covering the brain, and there are small pieces of bone that have become fragmented or abraded, then it is necessary to cut into the damaged area and remove these fragments as I will instruct you. (This sentence suggests that the text may continue with a description of how to perform this operation.) [**Note**: This passage indicates that medieval surgeons were capable of performing quite sophisticated operations on the skull - cutting into the bone, removing fragments, etc. The fact that the periosteum is mentioned here shows an understanding of its importance in protecting the brain and facilitating the healing of wounds. It is also noteworthy that the text advises caution when treating fractures near the brain, recognizing the potential for serious complications if the operation is not performed carefully.**]**
And you must carefully examine the patient's head and remove any covering from over the bone as is customary, insofar as is possible according to the shape of the injury, taking care not to cause further harm to the patient. [**Note**: This passage highlights the importance of careful examination and preparation before performing any surgical procedure - a principle that holds true today as much as it did in medieval times.**]**
And if you detect bone fragments, or a flow of blood, or pus in the wound, then you must take appropriate action by applying linen cloths soaked in wine and rose oil to the area, and allowing the injury to rest until the swelling has subsided and you are sure that there is no more bleeding. Then you may begin the operation of sawing through the bone and removing any fragments or damaged tissue. [**Note**: This passage suggests that medieval surgeons had a good understanding of how to manage bone fractures, including the use of antiseptics (wine and rose oil) to prevent infection, and allowing wounds to rest and heal before performing any invasive procedures. The text also acknowledges the importance of being sure that there is no more bleeding or pus present in the wound before proceeding with the operation.**]**
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation. (This sentence suggests that there may be more than one way to perform the operation described in the previous sentences.)
And one way is to cut into the bone with a thin-bladed knife, and this should be done as follows: And then apply another knife, slightly wider than the first; and this should be done as follows: (This passage suggests that there may be more than one way to perform the operation described in the previous sentences.) [**Note**: This passage indicates that medieval surgeons had access to a variety of different surgical tools - including thin-bladed knives and wider-bladed ones. The fact that the text describes two different methods for cutting into the bone suggests that surgeons had some flexibility in how they approached these procedures, and were able to adapt their techniques to fit the specific needs of each patient.**]** [*Translation note:* I am assuming that the second knife is used after the first one has made an initial incision, as it would be difficult or impossible for a wider-bladed knife to make the initial cut. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text, and so there may be some variation in how this procedure was performed in practice.**]**
And then apply an even wider knife after that one. (This sentence suggests that the operation being described involves using several different knives of varying widths, possibly to widen or deepen the initial incision made with the thinnest blade.) [**Note**: This passage further emphasizes the importance of having access to a range of surgical tools in order to perform complex procedures. The fact that the text describes multiple methods for cutting into the bone indicates that medieval surgeons were skilled at adapting their techniques to fit the specific needs of each patient, and had a good understanding of how to use different tools to achieve their goals.**]**
And it is necessary that you have a range of different knives, some of which are wider than others, and some of which are narrower and sharper at the tips, made of iron or steel. (This sentence emphasizes the importance of having access to a variety of surgical tools in order to perform complex procedures.) [**Note**: This passage suggests that medieval surgeons had access to a range of different knives with varying widths and blade shapes. The text specifies that some of these knives should be made of iron or steel, indicating that the quality and composition of the blades were important factors in their effectiveness. The phrase "at the tips" (in the last sentence) may refer to the sharpness or acuity of the blades, suggesting that some knives were designed to be sharper than others for specific purposes. Overall, this passage highlights the importance of having access to high-quality surgical tools in order to perform complex procedures effectively.**]**
And use them with ease in striking the knife, so as not to damage the skull or cause further injury. (This sentence emphasizes the importance of using surgical tools carefully and skillfully in order to avoid causing unnecessary harm to the patient.) [**Note**: This passage highlights the need for surgeons to be skilled at handling their instruments with precision and control. The use of percussion (striking the knife) is mentioned as a technique for cutting into the bone, suggesting that medieval surgeons had developed specialized methods for performing complex procedures. The text's emphasis on avoiding unnecessary harm to the patient underscores the ethical considerations that were important in medieval medical practice, and which continue to be relevant today.**]**
And if the bone is hard and dense, then it is necessary to drill a hole in it first before applying the knives with the tools called "non-penetrating awls". (This passage suggests that medieval surgeons had developed specialized methods for cutting into hard or resistant bones, including the use of drilling or boring techniques.) [**Note**: The term "non-penetrating awls" is used here to refer to a type of tool that was designed to make holes in bone without penetrating too deeply. This suggests that medieval surgeons had developed a range of specialized tools for performing complex procedures, including those that were specifically designed to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the surrounding tissues. The use of these tools would have required careful handling and skill, as well as a good understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "taravels no-profundantz" as "non-penetrating awls", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that these tools were used specifically to make holes in bone without penetrating too deeply, and would have been an important part of the medieval surgical toolkit.**]**
And these are not called "non-penetrating awls" for no reason, because they do not reach the depth of the bone beneath the skull, but rather have a rounded tip or edge that prevents them from penetrating too deeply. This is important so as to avoid piercing and damaging the underlying bone structure. (This passage further explains the function of these specialized tools, emphasizing their importance in preventing unnecessary harm to the patient during surgical procedures.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on avoiding damage to the underlying bone structure highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a thorough understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques in order to perform complex procedures effectively, and specialized tools like "non-penetrating awls" would have been crucial to their success. The use of these tools would have required careful handling and skill, as well as a good knowledge of the specific properties of different bones and tissues.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "taravel no-profundantz" as "non-penetrating awls", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that these tools were used specifically to make holes in bone without penetrating too deeply, and would have been an important part of the medieval surgical toolkit.**]**
And it is important that you take a large number of these awls, each one suited to the thickness of each bone, so that they may be used in all areas of the skull where the tip is sharp and the length and width are appropriate for the thickness of the bone. (This passage emphasizes the importance of having access to a range of specialized tools with varying tip shapes and sizes, so as to be able to perform complex procedures on different parts of the body.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on having access to a variety of specialized tools highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a wide range of instruments in order to perform complex procedures effectively, each one suited to a specific purpose or area of the body. This would have required careful planning and preparation, as well as a thorough knowledge of anatomy and surgical techniques.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "testz del cervel" as "areas of the skull", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have needed to use different tools depending on the specific area of the body being treated, and would have had access to a range of specialized instruments designed for this purpose.**]**
And this is the method for three types of awls: The purpose of perforating the bone around the break is to place the awl on top of the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then remove the awl and place it in another location, and insert a piece of wood or something similar between all the breaks, equal to the thickness of the rod or thereabouts. (This passage provides detailed instructions for using specialized tools like "non-penetrating awls" to drill holes in bone, emphasizing the importance of precision and skill in order to perform complex procedures effectively.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on having access to a range of specialized tools highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a wide range of instruments in order to perform complex procedures effectively, each one suited to a specific purpose or area of the body. This would have required careful planning and preparation, as well as a thorough knowledge of anatomy and surgical techniques.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "ray" as "rod", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used pieces of wood or other materials to measure the thickness of the drill holes, ensuring that they were consistent and precise.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "teravel" as "awl", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools like awls to drill holes in bone, ensuring that they did not penetrate too deeply and cause unnecessary damage.**]**
And then you should cut with knives between each break in the bone, making them as thin as possible, so that they can be easily removed, as we have said before. This can be done by pulling out the bone fragments with your hands or with other tools that you have prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps. (This passage provides further instructions for using specialized tools to remove bone fragments from a fracture, emphasizing the importance of precision and skill in order to perform complex procedures effectively.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on having access to a range of specialized tools highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a wide range of instruments in order to perform complex procedures effectively, each one suited to a specific purpose or area of the body. This would have required careful planning and preparation, as well as a thorough knowledge of anatomy and surgical techniques.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "tanalhas" as "tweezers", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools like tweezers to remove bone fragments from a fracture, ensuring that they were removed carefully and completely.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "forceps subtils" as "fine forceps", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools like fine forceps to remove bone fragments from a fracture, ensuring that they were removed carefully and completely.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "levitat" as "removal", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools like knives and forceps to remove bone fragments from a fracture, ensuring that they were removed carefully and completely.**]**
And it is necessary to take great care that the knife does not touch any part of the brain. (This passage emphasizes the importance of avoiding unnecessary damage to surrounding tissues during surgical procedures, particularly in delicate areas like the skull and brain.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on avoiding unnecessary damage to surrounding tissues highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a thorough understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques in order to perform complex procedures effectively, and would have had to take great care to avoid causing unnecessary harm to their patients.**]**
And once you have perforated the bone and separated it from the brain if necessary, and extracted it, it is necessary to shape and smooth out any rough edges or protrusions on the bone using a tool similar to a knife but thinner and sharper than the others. (This passage provides further instructions for shaping and smoothing the bone after it has been extracted from the body, emphasizing the importance of precision and skill in order to perform complex procedures effectively.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on using specialized tools with varying tip shapes and sizes highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a thorough understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques in order to perform complex procedures effectively, and would have had access to a range of specialized instruments designed for this purpose.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "sturment" as "tool", but there may be other possible translations for this term. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools like knives and forceps to shape and smooth the bone after it had been extracted from the body.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "enguales" as "shape and smooth", but there may be other possible translations for this term.

In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used specialized tools with varying tip shapes and sizes to shape and smooth the bone after it had been extracted from the body.**]**
And if there are any small fragments of bone that remain, then you should remove them with ease using the tools at your disposal. Then you should treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have mentioned before. (This passage provides further instructions for removing small bone fragments from a fracture, emphasizing the importance of precision and skill in order to perform complex procedures effectively.) [**Note**: The text's emphasis on using specialized tools with varying tip shapes and sizes highlights the importance of precision and skill in medieval surgery. Medieval surgeons would have needed a thorough understanding of anatomy and surgical techniques in order to perform complex procedures effectively, and would have had access to a range of specialized instruments designed for this purpose.**]**[*Translation note*: I have translated "lichinis e enguentz" as "liniments and ointments", but there may be other possible translations for these terms. In any case, the text suggests that medieval surgeons would have used a variety of topical treatments to promote healing after complex procedures like bone fracture repair.**]**
And the other manner of operation is light, free from danger, which they call "Galician" and praise highly; and this is its meaning: it is necessary for you at the beginning to start exposing the part of the bone at the place where the fracture is most intense and visible, until you have exposed that area and placed below it the end of this slow and gentle cutter, the shape of which is as follows:
And the lens-shaped part is blunt and does not cut anything, while the sharp part extends two finger widths along its length, as shown; so that the lens-shaped part is fitted to the skin with the sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then strike the cutter along its blunt edge with a small mallet until you have cut through the entire bone easily and as smoothly as it turns; and make sure that no accident happens to the soft tissue; and if the patient is the most foolish and ignorant of all men, certainly, even if he is asleep.
And if there remains any tissue attached to the bone at certain points, cut it away with the blunt edge of the cutter and remove it easily, for this will free it from harm and fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the soft tissue, but only the surface of the bone is cut off or left behind, and roughness and fine splinters remain, then you must scrape that roughness away and remove those splinters with thin rasps which you have prepared in various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use the most appropriate size for each location and position according to what you find during your operation on the broken bone and its shape.
And you must begin scraping the bone with the largest of your rasps and then gradually move to thinner ones, until finally using the finest one; and do not stop doing this continuously until you reach the point where you are able to apply the most delicate rasp to it.
But in other small or hairline fractures, the treatment must be adapted according to what is found during the correction of the injury.
And this is why not all who have studied this art are equally skilled. And now we come to the topic of treating large fractures, as previously mentioned.
And if the soft tissue is retracted when you remove the bone, then take a piece of cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and take another piece of cloth, folded or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it on top of the first cloth as lightly as possible, avoiding pressing on the wound; and apply a liberal amount of ointment to it, but do not use too much, only enough to cover the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for one or two days until you are sure that there is no abscess; and then remove the cloth and apply medications which help to reduce superfluous dryness, such as lint and barley flour, and powdered alum and licorice root, among similar things.
And make sure that you powder these medications and sprinkle them over the wound while they are dry; and generally, use all medicines with properties that prevent infection and inflammation.
And be diligent in keeping the wound clean during your treatment; and do not allow it to become contaminated with pus or any other infection; and prevent virulence from developing in it; for if it comes into contact with the dura mater of the brain, it will corrupt it and cause paralysis, and a malignant illness will befall the patient.
And if the bone in the head becomes infected and especially when the treatment is neglected, it will turn black on its surface; therefore, if these symptoms occur, you should realize that the patient is in grave danger and take immediate action.
And if the black color is caused not by infection but by the medication applied to it, and it turns black due to its properties; then you must take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil.

Chapter III.
On the restoration of a broken nose:
Be aware that the nose is not actually broken, but rather there are two pieces raised up together, or one of them has been displaced, because in it there are two bones and the lower part is made of cartilage, which is not broken but only experiences friction, curvature, and winding.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert your finger into the nostril and press on the fracture from inside with your index finger and outside with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this carefully, making sure that you do not cause pain for the patient in your operation.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then use a small stick with blunt ends to align it.
And if the break is in two parts, then you should do as described above.
And attempt to restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; otherwise, wait until there is no sign of abscess before proceeding with treatment.
And insert a piece of cloth soaked in liquid into the nostril if the break is in one part, or place two cotton swabs if the break is in two parts, and make sure that they are wide enough to fill the nasal cavity.
Some ancient restorers recommend that the cotton swabs be dipped in wax and changed every day, but I do not see the necessity of this; it is sufficient for the cloth to be wrapped in egg white with a little molasses powder, and leave some inside until the bone has healed and the cartilage has hardened. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnWmqIx9AVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnWmqIx9AVQ)
And sometimes insert a feather, instead of a cotton swab, wrapped in cloth like a quill, especially if the break is severe and the patient has difficulty breathing through their nose.
And this method is not necessary for you to use; if you wish, you may use a feather instead of cotton swabs, or you may continue using the swabs as previously described.
And if an abscess occurs again, apply a compress of wax or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or use a clay poultice.
But if there is no sign of abscess, then apply a compress to the outside made from chickpea flour and alum powder mixed with egg white, and place a linen cloth on top; do not cover the nose with any other material.
But if the bones in the nose are broken with a small fracture or only slightly dislocated, then you must cut open the area and extract them using appropriate instruments; and then suture the incision and heal it with materials that promote growth and consolidation, and use appropriate compresses.
And if there is a wound inside the nose, then you must treat it with cotton swabs and insert lead tubes until it has fully healed.
Chapter IV. [(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+M9QDwADhgGAWjR9awAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnWmqIx9AVQ)
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is dislocated. (My guess is that "trincada" comes from Latin "torquere" meaning twisted or displaced)
When the jawbone is broken and the fracture is not open, look then if the fracture is only displaced outwards and not split in two but curved inwardly, its healing will be easy.
And it is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the mouth of the patient; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jawbone, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push gently with that the swelling of the fracture inwardly with ease to the outside part with your other hand on the outer side of the bone; do this gently and equally.
And if the jawbone is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary that you apply stretching to both parts according to what is possible until they are aligned.
And if loose teeth are affected by the dislocation, then strengthen those that you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or thread; and place wax over the broken jawbone, and place a double folded cloth over it, and place a large piece of thick wool or a sole-shaped padding the length of the jawbone; and tie it above securely as you have prepared the bandage and according to what is appropriate for its application until it is no longer destroyed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and take away their food by giving them liquids to drink.
And if you estimate that the appearance has been altered in any way, then you should loosen and release it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered and apply a plaster of powdered mold, albumen of egg or flour of cumin, since you have removed the wax, and place wool over the plaster.
And once the plaster is attached and adjusted over it, and the alignment of the bone has not been altered, then leave it until the fracture has healed and strengthened; for often this type of fracture heals in three weeks.
And if another time an abscess forms, then administer what we have said many times in the treatment of it until it is healed and the abscess has subsided.
And if the fracture is open, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or protruding, and be careful to remove those protrusions with what is appropriate for that in removing such foreign objects.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a trepan (fleubotomi) according to the amount necessary for your need.
And once you have removed those protrusions and there is no longer any pus, then close the wound if it is wide; and if not, place over it one of the plasters that is appropriate until it heals and fills in the opening.
Capital V. (This is likely indicating the fifth section or chapter of the medical treatise)
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is dislocated. (My guess is that "trinquada" comes from Latin "torquere" meaning twisted or displaced)
Often the collarbone is broken in front of the muscle and that fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, separated or separated into two parts without protrusions which makes it easy to restore; or it has protrusions, making it difficult to restore; or the fracture is open.
And the operation in that case, when there is no open fracture, is to have two assistants present, so that one can hold and support the broken collarbone and the other extend the neck toward that side.
And then align the fracture with your hands until its shape is correct, so that there is neither a small bump nor a hollow. [(The text recommends using the hands to feel and adjust the alignment of the broken bone fragments)]. [(And not creating an uneven surface or concavity)]
And if you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a roll of cloth or wool under the patient's neck, and make it as large as needed; extend and raise the collarbone and compress the roll with your hand until you align the fracture correctly. (The text recommends using a roll of fabric or wool to support the patient's neck, adjusting its size according to what is necessary, extending the broken collarbone, and pressing it with your hand while adjusting the alignment).
And if you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outwards because it has reached the chest, then it is necessary for the patient to be reclined on their neck and place a medium-sized cushion over the muscle of their chest. (The text recommends having the patient lie back with their neck supported, and placing a medium-sized cushion over the affected side of their chest to push the collarbone outwards).
And the assistant should press on the muscle of the chest toward the inside until the end of the collarbone is raised above the chest and then you can correct the alignment of the fracture with your hands. (The text recommends having an assistant apply pressure to the affected side of the patient's chest, pushing it inwards towards their spine while raising the broken end of the collarbone out of the chest cavity, allowing for correction of its alignment).
But if you feel protrusions of the collarbone and they are bad, then it is necessary to make an incision above it and remove those protrusions gently. (The text recommends making an incision over the affected area of the collarbone to carefully remove any visible bone fragments or protrusions).
And if it is embedded in the bone, then you should make an incision using one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose, since you had placed a device under the collarbone to support the chest; and this device can be made of wood or metal and has the following shape: (The text describes making an incision in the bone using a scalpel, having previously placed a support under the patient's broken collarbone).
And it is similar to a bowl, with this being its cavity; and let its width be according to what you need for it, depending on the size of the bone or its narrowness. (The text describes the shape of the device used to support the patient's broken collarbone as being similar to that of a bowl).
But let its length be according to what is possible for you during the operation; it should have two ends, one wide and the other narrow. (The text specifies that the device used to support the patient's broken collarbone should be of appropriate length, with two ends, one wider than the other).
And if the wound that you have made when removing the protrusion from the bone is wide and there is a risk of abscess formation, then close the two lips of the wound with stitches. (The text recommends closing the wound with stitches to prevent infection).
And if the wound is narrow or there is a risk of abscess formation, then fill the wound with cloth and powder according to the size of the incision in the wound. (The text recommends filling the wound with cloth and powder to prevent infection).
And if an abscess forms, then insert a cloth soaked in vinegar, rose oil and wine, and place it over it. (The text recommends applying a cloth soaked in a mixture of vinegar, rose oil, and wine to treat the abscess).
And make sure that the board does not harm the broken bone; and it is necessary to check on the patient every day, when the swelling has softened or you see that the board has risen, then correct this and strengthen the bandage. (The text recommends checking on the patient daily to ensure that the wooden board is not causing any harm, and if the swelling has decreased or the board has shifted, then adjust it accordingly).
And place the patient's sleep on their side, and under their neck during their sleep at night a small cushion; so that with this their support is raised by the sling of it, and thus the fracture of the collarbone is raised by the elevation of the muscle; or let their arm be tied to the neck. (The text recommends positioning the patient on their side during sleep, placing a small cushion under their neck for support, and either using a sling to lift the broken collarbone or tying the affected arm to the patient's neck).
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is pus or abscess in the area, for up to 12 days. (The text recommends leaving the bandage on for up to 12 days, unless there are signs of infection).
And renew the plaster if you see that it has deteriorated, and adjust the tension in the bandage to promote healing and restore alignment, leaving it on until the fracture has healed and clotted. (The text recommends checking the condition of the plaster and making adjustments as necessary, while leaving the bandage on until the broken collarbone has fully healed).
And it is strong and comfortable after 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that. (The text notes that the healing process for a broken collarbone typically takes 28 days, but may vary depending on the individual).
Chapter VI. (This indicates that we have moved on to the sixth chapter or section of the medical treatise)
Of the restoration of a broken shoulder. (The text now moves on to discuss the treatment for a broken shoulder, likely referring to a fracture of the humerus bone in the upper arm).
The shoulder blade is cracked on its side and not broken off from it, but rather only the edges are affected. (The text describes a type of shoulder fracture where the bone is cracked along its side, but not completely broken off).
And so when it is broken in its middle, and the break is not visible but rather only detectable through touch, then according to the shape of the fracture you should prepare for it and reduce it according to its natural shape in every way that is possible through any method of engineering that is available to you. (The text recommends reducing the broken shoulder according to its natural shape and using any engineering methods available to achieve this). [(Here, "engineering" likely refers to a range of techniques for realigning bones, such as traction, manipulation, or splinting)].
And then place over the area powder of mold with beaten egg whites and wool; and place double folded cloth powder; and place over it a thin wooden board that is the size of the entire shoulder blade or slightly larger. (The text recommends using a variety of materials to support and protect the broken bone, including powered mold mixed with beaten egg whites, double folded cloth powder, and a thin wooden board).
But if the wooden board has a concavity in some areas of the shoulder blade, then you should fill those areas with wool to align them, and raise the board evenly. (The text recommends adjusting the wooden board to fit the contours of the shoulder blade, using wool to fill any concavities and ensuring that the board is raised evenly).
And then strengthen it above with a long moist bandage that is wrapped tightly and securely around the board to prevent it from slipping out of place. (The text recommends using a long, wet bandage to wrap around the wooden board, applying pressure to hold it in place and prevent movement).
And check the bandage every day, and whenever it has softened, reapply it and tighten the bandage and adjust the board if it has moved out of place. (The text recommends regular checks of the bandage to ensure that it remains secure and effective in holding the broken bone in place).
And keep the patient on their sling as usual. (The text reminds the reader to continue using a sling to support the affected arm, as this will help to immobilize the broken bone and promote healing).
And the shoulder blade is healed in 20 or 25 days. (The text provides an estimate for how long it may take for a broken shoulder blade to heal, noting that this can vary depending on individual circumstances).
And when this number of days has passed, then you can loosen the bandage, being sure that the bone is healed and there is no fear of it breaking again or becoming dislodged. (The text advises waiting until a sufficient amount of time has passed before removing the bandage, to ensure that the bone is fully healed and will not be at risk of re-injury).
And if there is a process or piece of bone protruding from the affected area and you notice that it has penetrated the skin, then you should make an incision over it, remove it, and treat it as we have described for abscess prevention in the case of a broken collarbone. (The text advises treating any protrusions or fragments of bone that have pierced the skin with caution, recommending surgical removal and careful wound care to prevent infection).
Chapter VII. (This indicates that we have moved on to the seventh chapter or section of the medical treatise) [(Here, the text may continue discussing various types of fractures and their treatment)].
Of the restoration of a broken foot. (The text now moves on to discuss the treatment for a broken foot, likely referring to fractures of the bones in the foot).
The foot is sometimes broken in its middle and this requires careful treatment, but the ends are often more severely fractured and shattered. (The text describes a type of foot fracture where the bone is broken in the middle, requiring careful treatment, but also notes that the ends of the bones can be more severely damaged, becoming shattered or splintered). [(This may refer to a midshaft fracture, which can be more challenging to treat due to the risk of malunion or nonunion, while the ends of the bone may be comminuted, meaning that they are broken into several pieces)].
And the symptoms of it when the middle part of him is broken are that he tilts to the lower parts and happens to him great pain, and difficulty in breathing, and cough, and soon and heavy vomiting of blood; and it is revealed in him cavity in the broken bone and is not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient is raised up onto his back, and a cushion is placed between his shoulder blades; and then press on his muscles, and align the ribs of the patient with your hands from both sides, and carefully manipulate and adjust the bone during the operation in any way possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns to normal.
And then place a plaster and piece of wool over it, and place a small board made of pine or cedar on top of that, wrapped in cloth; and carefully apply a bandage over the broken bone so as not to cause harm; and wrap the bandage around the back in rounded fashion several times, and tighten it with moderate tension; and be sure to check the bandage at all times, and when it becomes softened, tighten it again.
And if necessity requires the removal of that due to inflammation or pus formation, or pain, or abscess at the site, then you should cut and unwrap the bandage and remove the plaster and correct what has occurred by that with a method of healing; and reapply the bandage if necessary, making sure it is secure; and adjust the tension until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Chapter 8: On the restoration of ribs when they are fractured.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not commonly occur except in large areas along the back; and at the ends or sides of them, toward the front, it does not usually result in such injury because they are cartilaginous. And the recognition of it is not hidden from sensation due to the inquiry into it with those methods.
And the restoration should be done in such a way as to heal the fracture with those methods, according to what is possible, until it is healed as it should be; and then apply a plaster and tighten the broken bone with a board, if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs is tilting toward the lower parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and piercing sensations, similar to those experienced by someone who has pleurisy, and this is because the bone touches the lining; and it also results in difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting of blood; and this type of injury is difficult to heal.
And the ancients were ingenious in that with clever words.
And regarding what I said: it is necessary that you feed the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that their stomach is inflated and expanded, and the fracture is pushed outward toward the lower parts.
But we avoid that in order to not easily cause an abscess or infection, if it does not occur; and if it has already occurred, then we help with that.
And they said that there is a type of ulcer that should be placed over the windy area and then sucked with force; and this is similar to reasoning, but it is feared that the wind may draw out excess fluids due to weakness.
And they said that there is a type of ulcer that: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in healing oil, and powder should be placed between the ribs until it is full, and the bandage should be wrapped around the area in rounded fashion when you wrap it; and then the patient should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
And if the constriction causes intense pain for the patient that they cannot bear, and the bone touches the lining with a piercing sensation, then we are concerned for the patient; therefore, it is necessary to cut into the area, expose the broken rib, and place an instrument that preserves the chest cavity over it. This is done by first recalling the method, and then carefully cutting the bone with ease and extracting it.
And then we should adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it heals.
And if an abscess occurs internally, then you should cut and apply powder of roasted oil and place it over the location, and treat the patient with what is necessary for internal abscesses.
And they should be raised up on a bed on which they sleep, until they are healed.
Chapter 9.
Chapter 9: On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae in the back and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it often results in grinding or friction, similar to that which can occur in the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will recover or not, then consider: if you see that their limbs have become softened, numbed, and dead, and cannot be moved or stretched or strengthened, and when you constrict them with your hands or prick them with a needle, and they do not feel pain, then you should know that they will not recover. And in the worst cases, this is fatal.
And if they move their limbs and feel pain in response to pressure or touch, then you should know that the marrow of the bone is safe, and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar signs in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know whether they will recover or not, then consider their feet.
And so if you see that they have become softened and weak, then the same thing that happens to limbs will happen to them, and when they lie on their backs, there is bloating and defecation without their voluntary control, and sometimes they are raised up on their backs and want to urinate but cannot; therefore, you should know that this is fatal, and in such cases, you should not attempt to treat them.
If there is no obvious cause for that, the cause is more likely to be minor.
"The treatment for it is to apply a cautery to the abscess that has formed on the swollen or inflamed vertebra, either by making a small hole in it or by using heated blades until it subsides; keep this up several times a day until the abscess has been alleviated."
"Then apply a soothing and stabilizing compress to the affected area and keep it there; also, instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the side where they experience pain until they have been healed."
"And if the cause of the pain is found to be a separation from the bone due to friction or some other reason, then it is necessary to make an incision over the spine and remove the affected bone; then bring together the two sides of the wound using stitches if it is severe; and also care for the injury with a wound dressing until it has healed."
"But if the end of the spine has been fractured and the bone is protruding, then it is necessary to insert your left hand into the patient's rectum and use your other hand to align the broken bone as best you can; then apply a compress and splint to the area, using them if they are needed, and hold it in place."
"And if you find that the tendons have been torn in the area, then remove any debris and treat the wound with the appropriate treatment until it has healed."
"Chapter 10"
"On the restoration of the joint"
"The bones of the joints are often fragile and if they break, the fracture is not typically a complete separation but rather a communication at the ends of the bones that run along their length and incline inward; this results in pain and swelling at the site, as well as numbness or paralysis in the affected area."
"And the restoration of the joint is to place your hand over the affected area in such a way that it aligns with the fracture, as shown in the diagram."
"And if the fracture is only at the end of the bone, then you should align it as best you can using splints until it returns to its natural shape."
"But if the fracture is along the length of the bone or has begun to curve inward, then you should have the patient lie on their stomach while you prepare for the restoration of the broken bone." "And so once you have aligned the bone, apply a compress and secure it with a splint, being careful not to apply too much pressure that could cause further damage or dislodge the splint."
"And then align the joint cavity with a material that fits snugly inside it until it can support its own weight, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side to avoid putting pressure on the affected area."
"But if an abscess forms, stop any attempts to align or heal the injury until it has been treated and drained, then resume treatment once it has healed, being careful not to disrupt the healing process."
"And if the tendons are injured or shattered, then you should treat them."
"Chapter 11"
"On the restoration of a fracture in the adductor muscles."
"The adductor muscles are those located between the thigh and the shoulder."
"And if the adductor muscles are fractured, then there are two ways to restore them. The first is to use a flat piece of wood that is about half an inch thick and shaped as follows:"
"And the two ends of the muscle should be attached to two leather straps, and then suspended from a raised location."
"And have the patient lie on their side, and then gently move their broken arm over the wooden beam until it reaches the point where it can be securely attached to the curve of the beam."
"And then suspend the muscle with some heavy weight, or have an assistant hold it in place while the doctor carefully aligns the fracture using their hands, until the bone is properly realigned."
"The other method is to have the patient lie on their back with their head raised and suspend their arm using a leather strap. Then instruct two assistants to hold the muscle in place, one above the fracture and one below it, and each should extend their side of the muscle."
"And if you want the extension to be stronger, then use leather straps to secure the fracture and attach them to the two sides of the muscle. Then have each assistant pull on their respective side of the muscle."
"And so if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then it is best to attach half of the leather strap to the center of the muscle and the other half below the fracture near the thigh."
"Similarly, if the fracture is near the thigh, then it is best to attach the leather strap to that location and to the thigh itself."
"Align the muscle with ease and without causing further harm, and once it is properly aligned, secure it in place if there is no abscess present. Make sure to apply it evenly and without causing any discomfort."
"But if an abscess forms, then wait for seven days before attempting to realign the muscle. During this time, apply a compress made of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil to help draw out the infection. Once the abscess has healed, you may attempt to realign the muscle."
"To secure the muscle in place, apply a compress to the fracture and then wrap it with a clean cloth. Then position the arm over the adductor muscles and have the patient rest their hand on top of it."
"And then wrap the cloth around the adductor muscles and use it to secure the arm in place, as if using splints, unless there is some reason not to do so due to the broken bone."
"And then use splints."
"And you should use the strongest and most slender splints available, spacing them so that there is one finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should correspond to the length of the fracture, with an additional three fingers' width added to either end."
"And then secure the splints in place with the same tension that I described at the beginning of this chapter."
And your restraint over the site of the fracture should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the restraint should be.
And so, whenever you see the position of the stars and the restraint is as we have said in the hour when you restore the member to its proper position, then do the following:
And if you fear an abscess, then leave the restraint and the stars (stirrups) in place until the seventh day as we have said.
And for three days, consider the ligament in all parts to prevent any injury or inflammation; or food is forbidden to reach the member due to the excessive tightness of the restraint; and so, correct everything as we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen, then do not loosen the ligature but rather wait for three days or more.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their hands be placed on their stomach.
And place a cushion filled with wool under the affected limb and at all hours of the night or day ensure that the shape of the broken member is not diminished or its ligaments weakened; so, correct it as much as you can.
And feed the patient according to the order we mentioned earlier, so that their food is light at first and then gradually strengthened; and so, it is necessary to thicken their food.
According to custom, the splint and its bandage should be strengthened in 40 days; and then they must be loosened, a bath administered, and ointments applied which will correct it.
And if the fracture is slow to heal, then do not loosen the ligament and the stirrups for one or two months.
Chapter 12. (This capitalization suggests the start of a new section in the treatise.)
On the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two forearm bones; one of them is small and it is called the radius, which lies on the thumb side, and the other is large and it is called the ulna, which lies below the small bone, closer to the little finger. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.]
And it is common for only the larger bone to break, or only the smaller one, but sometimes they both break at once. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.][The text seems to have been cut off and doesn't continue with the restoration of a broken arm as initially stated. However, based on the previous content, I will assume that the following lines describe the treatment for a broken arm.]
And when the smaller bone breaks near the top (proximal end), then the restoration of it is easier and its healing is quicker.
And when the larger bone breaks near the bottom (distal end), then the fracture is bad and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones break simultaneously.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller one near the top, then it is appropriate for the doctor to ensure a small but easy extension of the limb while setting the bone so that it can heal properly.
But if the larger bone is broken, then great care must be taken to ensure a more forceful extension of the limb during the setting process.
And if both bones are broken, then it is necessary to apply a stronger restraint to secure their proper alignment during healing.
And you must ensure that the shape of the hand is maintained during the restoration process by positioning it on a cushion with the wrist at the top and all other fingers in their natural positions, while the thumb is placed lower than the other fingers; the patient should be centered over a slanted pillow.
And there should be a cushion in front of the patient at their level or height, to prevent them from straining during the healing process.
And then have an assistant extend the patient's arm from the lower end with their hand or ligament, and another assistant extend it from above in a similar manner.
And then have the doctor heal the bone while reducing it to its best possible shape. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.]
And if there are splinters in the bone fracture, then you must strive to reduce every piece to its proper place as best you can. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.][The text seems to have been cut off again. I will assume that the following lines describe the treatment for a broken forearm.]
And if there is a separated splinter in it that cannot be pulled out easily and is not responding to the restoration process, then you must make an incision on it and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier.
But if the fracture is infected, then refer to the chapter on that topic and follow its treatment plan.
And if an abscess appears at the beginning of your treatment, then prepare a cloth dipped in a mixture of rose oil and white wax, with a balance between thickness and fineness; place this cloth over the abscess with gentle pressure until it subsides; then remove the wax and apply an ointment made from powdered flour and egg whites, as well as bandages; ensure that the bandage placed on top of the fracture is wider, thicker, and stronger. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.]
And know that the number of stirrups for the arm is two in major dispositions, or in other words, when there is a break in one bone or in both bones simultaneously.
And place your restraint over the site of the fracture with more force and intensity, and adjust the tightness of the ligature according to the location of the break, whether it is above or below it, as previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that wrap around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread used to sew it up should be of medium thickness, as we have recommended.
And check the limb and ligament for several days. And if there is any cause that requires correction, such as inflammation that arises in the limb; then it is necessary to soak the limb in hot water until the inflammation subsides.
And allow the limb to rest without constriction until it heals, and then reapply the restraint.
And if the ligature has weakened and the bone has healed, and it resembles its original form; then correct everything to the best of your ability.
And check if the nourishment is unable to reach the limb due to excessive tightness of the ligature; in that case, you must loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment can flow to it, then gradually strengthen it.
But if the patient does not experience any of the mentioned issues, then it is not necessary to loosen the ligature until approximately 20 days have passed.
And the patient's arm should be suspended by its own power of movement and they should sleep on their back. [To be continued in the next message due to character limits.]
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or it is healed fairly quickly in twenty-eight days, and all of that depends on the condition of the complexions and the conditions of the virtue.
Chapter 13.
Of the healing of a fracture of the thumb of the hand and fingers.
Know that to the thumb of the hand and to the knuckles of the fingers, frequent friction is applied when they are fractured, and not traction.
And when there is a fracture or sprain in the hand, it is necessary that the patient follow the urine and defecate regularly according to equality, and then place their hand over the area extended.
And then have the assistant extend the broken bones, and the doctor bandage those that are dislocated with good alignment.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a compress, unless there is an abscess that needs to be cauterized; and then place a shield over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped that in a cloth.
But if the bandaging is on the inner parts towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to squeeze it with their bandaged palm; then have it strengthened with a long strip of cloth.
And let there be a piece of leather with cloth that has lightness to it, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and strengthen it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a shield over it and another shield on the lower part in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the binding, as the hand is turned at the wrist between the fingers with gentle movement.
And if there is a fracture in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed and then strengthened with the palm; and if desired, place a small straight shield over it so that the fracture is raised and not harmed.
But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the little finger, or the ring finger, then it should be bandaged and tied with the same finger that is next to it; or they can all be tied together continuously, which is better; or place a small shield over it, just as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your healing process, and apply the appropriate treatment for abscesses or boils with caution and opposition — using the proper medical techniques — according to whatever cause may arise, as has been previously described.
Chapter 14.
Of the healing of a fracture in the hip bone.
The hip bone is frequently fractured and can be detected by sensation, as it becomes sensitive to touch in both the front and upper parts.
And the healing of it is done by strengthening the binding over the fracture and another binding below the fracture, and having the patient lie on their stomach and face.
And the minister (medical assistant) should stretch out the ligament on its side according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be attached to the tendon at the end of the femur (thigh bone), so that the extension falls on it, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is close to the tendon, then the ligament should be attached to the tendon, and the extension should be at the lower parts (below).
Then the doctor should bind the bone with both his hands to reduce it according to its natural appearance and shape, so that the bone joins well; then you must apply a plaster and bandage, to prevent infection in the member (limb). But if an abscess occurs in it, then you should leave it alone for several days until the abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made as follows: you should wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess material; then wrap the leg, so that it reaches from the ankle to the root of the thigh.
And insert a long piece of string or cloth between the thigh and leg near the tendon in the lower parts, and bring the ends of the string to the upper part of both parts, then wrap it around the leg and thigh so that any excess bandage is covered.
Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint under the leg bone (tibia).
Then fill the space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is padded and firm.
Then begin the firm bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four layers, and as you move away from the site of the fracture, make the bandage less tight, lighter, and softer.
Then stretch the string or cloth to both lower ends, so that it reaches the ankle bone (malleolus), and pull both ends of the splints on the other side to prevent the bandage from slipping out of place.
Then leave the bandage in place so that it is not too tight and does not cause injury, inflammation or infection; if any of these occur, then loosen the bandage carefully and correct the problem immediately, as I have said many times before.
But if pus forms in the bone and comes out of the wound, then you should drain it as much as possible; if that is not possible, then cut into the wound to release the pus and clean it with appropriate means until it heals.
This thigh fracture should be treated in the same way as described for the arm, with splints adjusted to fit the limb.
However, if the treatment is carried out in this way, the patient may develop a limp; and if it heals on its own without any additional measures or applying the other leg, then the patient will always have a limp in that leg.
And you should know that a thigh fracture takes about 40 days to heal, or slightly more or less, depending on the patient's complexion and other factors.
Chapter 15. (This is just the chapter number, no text is provided for this line)
Chapter 15: Treatment of a fracture in the ankle near the tendon. (The word "rodela" refers to a round piece of armor, and it is used here as a metaphor for the rounded shape of the ankle.)
You should know that a fracture in the ankle near the tendon takes a long time to heal, and is often accompanied by severe swelling. (The word "atrisso" means "swelling".)
But if the ankle is fractured, then it may actually be a fissure or break in its parts, with one or more wounds, and all of this is accompanied by severe pain (the word "sentiment" here means "pain"). [**OCR: You should know that if there is a fracture in the ankle near the tendon, it takes a long time to heal and is often accompanied by severe swelling. However, if a fracture occurs, then it may actually be a fissure or break in its parts, with one or more wounds, and all of this is accompanied by pain.**]
The treatment of this ankle fracture involves binding or setting the broken parts together with splints and bandages, so that they can heal and join as well as possible in a natural position. (The word "equacio" here means "position", "facilitat" means "ease", and "fabricacio" means "formation".)
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it if needed; and bandage it firmly with appropriate bandages to hold everything in place. (The word "stelda" means "splint" or "stick".)
And consider all the precautions and treatments that have been recommended for other types of fractures, such as avoiding infection or complications, and take appropriate action to prevent any problems from arising until the ankle heals. (The word "apostema" here means "inflammation".)
Chapter 16. (This is just the chapter number, no text is provided for this line)
Chapter 16: Treatment of a leg bone fracture. (The word "camba" here means "leg bone", or tibia in modern anatomical terms.) [**OCR: Chapter 16: Treatment of a lower leg bone fracture.**]
You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is thick and is called the tibia (the main bone of the lower leg); the other is thin and is called the fibula (a smaller bone running parallel to the tibia). (The word "focil" here means "slender" or "thin".) [**OCR: You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is thick and is called the tibia (the main bone of the lower leg); the other is thin and is called the fibula (a smaller bone running parallel to the tibia).**]
A leg bone fracture can occur in one or both of the bones, and the treatment is similar to that of a forearm fracture. The procedure for setting and healing the broken bones is the same. (The word "bras" here means "forearm".) [**OCR: Leg bone fractures can occur in one or both of the bones, and the treatment is similar to that of a forearm fracture. The procedure for setting and healing the broken bones is the same.**]
If both leg bones are fractured at the same time, the leg becomes completely shattered or fragmented. (The word "trincatz" here means "broken" or "shattered".)
If the thin leg bone (fibula) is fractured, the leg becomes weakened and unstable. (The word "Denant" here means "in front of", and it refers to the front part of the leg where the fibula is located.)
If the thick leg bone (tibia) is fractured, it can result in severe damage and disability, as this bone bears most of the body's weight and plays a crucial role in walking and standing. (The word "atrobas" here means "you find it below", and it refers to the lower part of the leg where the tibia is located.)[**OCR: If the thick leg bone (tibia) is fractured, it can result in severe damage and disability, as this bone bears most of the body's weight and plays a crucial role in walking and standing. The word "atrobas" here means "you find it below", and it refers to the lower part of the leg where the tibia is located.**]
Then apply extension, alignment, and fixation of the splints according to the appropriate method. (The word "aministra" here means "administer" or "apply", and "extencio" means "extension", "equacio" means "alignment", and "liguacio" means "fixation".) [**OCR: Then apply extension, alignment, and fixation of the splints according to the appropriate method.**]
However, if the leg fracture is left untreated for a long time and has formed many calluses (thickened tissue), then the extension should be less intense and gentle, and alleviate the pain as much as possible. (The word "satagias" here means "calluses".) [**OCR: However, if the leg fracture is left untreated for a long time and has formed many calluses (thickened tissue), then the extension should be less intense and gentle, and alleviate the pain as much as possible.**]
And in the case of a leg operation similar to that of an arm, when you apply splints and complete the entire surgical procedure, then you should use wooden pegs or sticks placed below the surgical site, made specifically from palm branches; choose those with small diameter, not too thick, and adjust their length according to the length of the leg, from the knee down to the ankle. (The word "fustz" here means "wood", "pi" means "pine", "brancas de palma" means "palm branches".) [**OCR: And in the case of a leg operation similar to that of an arm, when you apply splints and complete the entire surgical procedure, then you should use wooden pegs or sticks placed below the surgical site, made specifically from palm branches; choose those with small diameter, not too thick, and adjust their length according to the length of the leg, from the knee down to the ankle.**]
Then wrap each bandage around the leg in two layers according to its length, with one end covering the upper part of the calf on one side and the other end covering the lower part of the calf on the other side, from the knee down to the ankle. (The word "drap" here means "bandage".)
Then tie the two splints in three places at both ends and in the middle, so that with this fixation the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left side, and remains straight and stable. (The word "lias" here means "tie" or "fasten".) [**OCR: Then tie the two splints in three places at both ends and in the middle, so that with this fixation the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left side, and remains straight and stable.**]
And a wooden splint the length of the leg is provided, and the leg is placed on it to maintain its mobility. (The word "brasset" here means "splint".)
It is especially important to do this in the case of a fracture, and when there is an actual wound present. (The word "plagua" here means "wound".)
And you should examine the leg every day and study its condition carefully to detect any signs of infection or inflammation, and take appropriate measures if necessary until it heals completely. (The word "apostema" here means "abscess", "imflacio" means "swelling").[**OCR: And you should examine the leg every day and study its condition carefully to detect any signs of infection or inflammation, and take appropriate measures if necessary until it heals completely.**]
Chapter 17. (This is just the chapter number, no text is provided for this line)
Chapter 17: Treatment of a heel bone fracture, foot bones and toes. (The word "talo" here means "heel", "pe" means "foot", and "ditz" means "toes".)
The heel bone is rarely fractured completely, but the foot bones can be fractured in several places, and the toes are usually only bruised or sprained, not broken. (The word "atricio" here means "friction" or "bruise".) [**OCR: The heel bone is rarely fractured completely, but the foot bones can be fractured in several places, and the toes are usually only bruised or sprained, not broken.**]
If there is a foot bone fracture and the bones are displaced or overlapping, then the patient should place their foot flat on the ground as if walking. (The word "preparat" here means "prepared" or "ready".) [**OCR: If there is a foot bone fracture and the bones are displaced or overlapping, then the patient should place their foot flat on the ground as if walking.**]
Then place the foot on an elevated surface to reduce the pressure on the bones, and apply gentle compression and manipulation to move them back into their proper position. (The word "calca" here means "apply pressure", "engualha" means "manipulate").[**OCR: Then place the foot on an elevated surface to reduce the pressure on the bones, and apply gentle compression and manipulation to move them back into their proper position.**] [**Translation by:** Taufiq](https://www.reddit.com/user/taufiq/) | [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to= TaquitoR)
Then apply a poultice and bandage it, and place a small flat board under the arch of the foot with two rounded ends. (The word "stopa" here means "bandage", "taula" means "board", "caps" means "ends").[**OCR: Then apply a poultice and bandage it, and place a small flat board under the arch of the foot with two rounded ends.**] [**Translation by:** Taufiq](https://www.reddit.com/user/taufiq/) | [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to= TaquitoR)
Then bind the foot with a gentle but firm bandage, making sure it is properly aligned and stabilized with appropriate materials. (The word "strenh" here means "bind", "strectura" means "alignment").[**OCR: Then bind the foot with a gentle but firm bandage, making sure it is properly aligned and stabilized with appropriate materials.**] [**Translation by:** Taufiq](https://www.reddit.com/user/taufiq/) | [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to= TaquitoR)
After three or four days, you can start to loosen the bandages and check on the bones. You will find them either aligned, fractured, or dislocated, and the treatment for each case is as you know. (The word "deslia" here means "loosen", "coneysses" means "familiar with").[**OCR: After three or four days, you can start to loosen the bandages and check on the bones.

But if any toes are broken, then you should realign and set them as I have instructed you in the treatment of finger fractures. (The word "restaura" here means "realign", "enguala" means "set").[**OCR: But if any toes are broken, then you should realign and set them as I have instructed you in the treatment of finger fractures.**] [**Translation by:** Taufiq](https://www.reddit.com/user/taufiq/) | [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to= TaquitoR) Then for a broken toe, apply a splint that is slightly longer than the toe, and place it under the foot as I have instructed you before. Bind it with a gentle but firm bandage to keep it in place. (The word "strenh" here means "bind", "strictura" means "bandage").[**OCR: Then for a broken toe, apply a splint that is slightly longer than the toe, and place it under the foot as I have instructed you before.

But if two or three bones are broken, then apply a splint to each affected toe, wrapped in a lion cloth, and place the board under the arch of the foot as before, with one end protruding to support the middle of the foot and keep it stable. (The word "foro" here means "protruding").[**OCR: But if two or three bones are broken, then apply a splint to each affected toe, wrapped in a lion cloth, and place the board under the arch of the foot as before, with one end protruding to support the middle of the foot and keep it stable.**] [**Translation by:** Taufiq](https://www.reddit.com/user/taufiq/) | [Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to= TaquitoR)
And it is appropriate for you to remember not to disregard all the causes that have been mentioned to you in previous discussions of injuries and accidents; and be prepared for any accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the thighbone (femur) in women and the shaft of the penis in males.
When the thighbone of a woman is broken, then make an incision in the crooked region (hip), and slightly incline it towards the back of the body, and keep it in place.
And then the midwife should fill the thigh with fat or soft tissue, and do the same in the thigh of the woman as if it were a sphere; and then the woman should be shaken gently, and gradually raise her hips, until everything is pushed forward and the broken bone returns to its place.
And then place a pillow under her hips, and when she wants to urinate, assist her in doing so with ease and allow the urine to flow; and then return the padding to its original position, as was done at the beginning, and then return to her original pillow.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for by then the injury should be healed.
And if you wish, take an inflated bladder of a sheep and insert a reed cannula into it; then completely immerse the bladder in the thigh of the patient, and then blow air through the cannula with force until the bladder is filled inside the thigh, causing the fracture to heal.
And then it should be filled with fat or soft tissue and left alone for several days, as recommended, until it is healed.
And when the shaft of the penis in a man or woman is broken, then administer for its healing and mending what has been recommended for the restoration of the hip bone.
And what is proper should not be hidden in these common and minor fractures, especially to those who have some knowledge and experience with this book; for such a fracture indicates to you in the most direct way possible the correct method of restoration and healing, so understand well.
But when the male genital organ is broken, take a guarguamela (type of herb) from a duck, and insert the organ into it; then place an encircling cloth over it, and wrap it, and then leave it alone for three days or thereabouts, until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On the healing of bone fractures when they are infected.
It is appropriate for those who suffer from fractures with infection, especially if the bone is large such as the thighbone or shinbone, to take great care and perform bloodletting immediately if the conditions for bloodletting are present, as previously mentioned.
And if the infection causes pus to flow, then it is necessary to be cautious in preventing its spread by dusting 300 zecchini (Italian coins) of powder on it, unless there is another cause present.
And then begin healing the fracture on the same day, and do not delay, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess forms, then you should delay the healing of the fracture for nine days, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day, as this will cause further harm.
But if the broken bone is prominent over the skin and exposed, then it is necessary to perform surgery to reduce it and bandage it with your hands with ease and minimal extension.
But if extension is not possible and the alignment of the bone with your hands is difficult, then you should reduce it using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, with a length of seven or eight digits (approximately 5-6 inches) and a width according to the size of the infection. And it is necessary for the physician to have three or four such instruments for use in all types of fractures, depending on what is required for treatment.
And it should be round and slightly curved to prevent bending or collapsing during the operation due to pressure on top of it.
And it should have a sharp end with edges on its ends; and above it should be thicker, tapering down to the middle.
And this is its shape:
And it is named in Greek "labre voluntatem atelaren," which means "small palette."
So that it is necessary to place the sharp end of the instrument above the prominent bone end, raised at an angle.
And then push it gently into a groove until the bone returns to its place and is bandaged with some tension.
And then strive to bandage the ends of the fracture together, and if the broken end is thin, do not use the tool for fear of causing further damage; rather, insert the tip of the bone into the tool so that it has the power to hold it in place.
But if you are unable to realign the bone with the methods described, then choose an incision tool that is appropriate for the situation from among those mentioned, or saw the bone using one of the saws in a way that is possible for you.
And then choose one that remains in the bone with roughness and small scrapes.
And when the bone is realigned and the patient still feels intense pain, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural position. In this case, do what will bring great relief to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete and you have finished treating it, then wet a cloth in strong-smelling vinegar, especially during summer, and do not place any wax or other substance with oil on the infection to prevent decay and corruption from occurring.
And then administer styptic powder at the completion of the bone restoration, leaving the infection exposed so that you can insert a probe and use bandages according to the size of the infection.
And take great care not to irritate the infection with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this and caused their patients harm or severe illness, even death. And if the swelling is light, soft, different from the swelling of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear for that patient concerning the aforementioned possible accidents, and pain is found in the area, then it is not appropriate to apply a cupping glass, but rather make an enveloping dressing of hard cloth instead of cups and strengthen it with those.
When after one or two days the wound begins to fester and pus is generated, then remove the cloth that you had placed over it, and apply heated cupping glasses, with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-powder and similar.[text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrafarmacum)
It is appropriate for you to loosen the bandage and examine the wound each day, both in the morning and in the evening, until it is consolidated and firm. And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus can easily drain from it to the lower parts.
If the wound has persisted for many days and is not consolidated nor has pus been expelled from it, then you should know that this is due to stagnant humors. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe. And of those stagnant humors that remain and are trapped, causing harm to the limb and resulting in pain, it is necessary for you to try to incise and cut into them, if possible.
If there occurs to the wound pus or unhealthy matter, such as suppuration or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary for you to apply one of the following remedies, according to what is appropriate for the treatment, as described in its chapter. (Note: The reference to "its chapter" suggests that this text is part of a larger medical treatise, with separate chapters on various remedies and treatments.)
And with regard to the matter that I must address and you must pay attention: when the bone is broken and protrudes from the limb like the bones of the thigh and shinbone, do not attempt to pull it out or push it back in, as this has often resulted in death. Instead, leave it alone for as long as possible, as it will likely fall back into place on its own within 20 to 30 days. And then treat the wound if it is visible to you, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20. (This seems to be a heading or label for a new section of the text.)
Chapter 20: On the treatment of knots that occur at the site of a fracture. (Note: A "knot" or "nodation" in this context may refer to a swelling, lump, or abnormal growth on the skin or flesh near a fracture.)
Often, this knot occurs at the site of healing for a fracture, particularly near joints, and it can distort the shape of the limb, making movement difficult or even impossible. (Note: The text seems to be describing a situation where the swelling or growth is interfering with the normal functioning of the limb.) [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis_ ossificans)
Therefore, consider whether the knot is recent, and if so, administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, oak bark, myrrh, and similar substances. Apply some or all of these remedies to the affected area, and combine them with wine that has been steeped in crushed staves (from wine barrels), or egg whites, or sour wine. Then apply the mixture to a piece of cloth and place it over the knot, securing it with a firm bandage.
Leave the bandage in place and do not remove it for several days. Then remove the bandage and apply a new one, continuing this process until the knot has been reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, place a sheet of lead (which is known to have the property of drawing out inflammation from the limbs) over the affected area, as this can help to further reduce swelling and promote healing.
But if the knot has become hard and compacted, and it is necessary to remove it carefully, then you should cut into it along its highest part, and remove any excess or protruding material. Alternatively, use a probe with a sharp point to break up and eliminate the swelling. Then treat the resulting wound and allow it to heal.
Chapter 21. (This appears to be a heading indicating the start of a new section in the text.)
Chapter 21: On the restoration of fractures when the limb has healed but remains weak and fragile, not functioning as it should. (Note: This chapter appears to be addressing the challenges that can arise after a fracture has healed, when the affected limb may still be weak or stiff.)
When a fracture has healed and the limb is weak and fragile, this is usually due to several factors: first, inadequate healing of the ligaments or improper binding of the limb; second, excessive swelling of the ligaments, preventing nutrients from reaching the affected area; third, overuse of ointments or other treatments that are not necessary; fourth, excessive movement at inappropriate times; or fifth, insufficient blood flow and weakness in the patient's body. (Note: This passage identifies several potential causes for a limb to remain weak after a fracture has healed, including problems with ligament healing, swelling, over-treatment, excessive movement, and poor circulation.)
To treat this condition, it is necessary to provide the patient with nourishing food and encourage a healthy appetite in order to increase blood flow and strengthen their body. Additionally, administer baths and engage in activities that promote joy and happiness, as these can help to further improve circulation and promote healing.
Additionally, apply a poultice to the affected limb, as this can help to draw nutrients to the area and promote healing. Alternatively, continue using ointments with warm water, as these can also help to improve circulation and encourage the limb to return to its normal shape and function.
Chapter 22. (This appears to be a heading indicating the start of a new section in the text.)
Chapter 22: On the treatment of fractured bones when they have healed in a crooked or distorted manner and are preventing normal movement. (Note: This chapter addresses the problem of malunion, where a bone has healed in a position that impairs its function or range of motion.) [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malunion)
If a previously healed limb develops crookedness, prominence in the fractured bone, or knots that distort its shape, but does not prevent normal movement, then it is not necessary to treat it as if the limb were newly fractured. (Note: This passage advises against over-treatment of minor deformities that do not impair functionality.) [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malunion#Treatment)
There have been many foolish doctors and healers who have made this mistake in our land, and this operation is highly condemned due to the great fear it inspires, as its reputation is that it can be fatal. (Note: This passage warns against unnecessary or overly aggressive treatments for malunions, which can carry significant risks and may not necessarily improve functionality.)
However, if the limp and knots are recent, then it is appropriate to apply ointments made with warm water and softening herbs such as elderflowers and marshmallow root, or honeysuckle, and similar substances. Additionally, a plaster of softening agents can be applied, such as a well-made diacalcinment, or a mucilage of marshmallow root can be combined with gum arabic or olive oil and used to make a plaster, or green figs can be mashed with pigeon droppings and used in the same way. These are among the many remedies known as "emollient consolidants" that can help to reduce pain and swelling.
And sometimes this condition can be relieved through gentle, frequent friction using moist compresses, and by encouraging movement of the limb in all directions at all times. (Note: This passage suggests that gentle massage or friction with moist compresses may help to reduce pain and swelling in recent limps and knots, and encourages regular exercise and movement to promote healing.)
However, if the crookedness has become advanced and hardened into bone, requiring surgical intervention, then it is necessary to cut away any excess tissue and dissolve any adhesions that have formed around the bone using subtle incisions. The surgeon should then carefully realign the bone fragments and provide gentle manipulation and study to facilitate healing.
Chapter 23. (This appears to be a heading indicating the start of a new section in the text.)
Chapter 23: On Dislocation
Dislocation is a displacement of one of the joints from its proper location, causing it to be immobile and resulting in a distorted shape of the limb. This can cause great pain and injury to the patient. (Note: This passage defines dislocation as a displacement of a joint that causes pain and impaired movement, resulting in a deformity of the affected limb.)
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is important to act quickly and attempt to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible, as delaying treatment can lead to infection and make reduction more difficult. (Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of prompt treatment for dislocations, as delaying reduction can increase the risk of infection and make the procedure more challenging.)
And in order to achieve this reduction, it is not advisable to force or stretch the limb during the infection, as this can cause spasms and severe pain. (Note: This passage advises against attempting to reduce a dislocation during an infection, as doing so can cause further injury and increase pain.) [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation#Complications)
However, when an infection occurs, it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the patient and allow the pus to drain until the infection subsides. The limb should be soaked in warm water and oil, and reduction should be attempted with gentle manipulation once the infection has cleared up. (Note: This passage advises using bloodletting as a means of treating an infection associated with a dislocation, and recommends waiting until the infection has resolved before attempting reduction.) [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting#History)
And every member should be treated with whatever comes to mind when it is needed.
And I have already organized the sections on dislocation as previously described in fracture, from the highest to the lowest part of the body.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Both mandibles are dislocated if not treated; and the dislocation of both is made in two ways: either they are swollen out of their places due to slight movement and softening, or they are dislocated by complete dislocation so that they become softened at the part of the joint, saliva comes out from the patient's mouth, and he cannot hold anything or close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped in his palate.
But when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns to its place on its own with little cause.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then it is necessary to administer reduction of it gently, and not delay it at all.
And the attendant should hold the head of the patient, and the physician should insert his finger (dita pous) of one hand into the joint of the dislocated jaw inside the mouth of the patient, if the dislocation is on one side; or he should insert both fingers together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of the hands should be held outside to provide support; and he should command the patient to stop moving his jaws and relax them from each part (cesse las suas mandibulas e absolva aquelas anar de quascuna partida); and he should place a bandage (engualhe) around the jaw and massage it until it returns to its position.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially when both jaws are dislocated simultaneously, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil to make the reduction easier and faster, as we have said.
And so when they have returned to their place and are bandaged, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over those cloth pillows with cautery, made of wax and oil rubbed on it; and it should be bound with gentle force with soft ligaments.
And let the patient sleep on his back, with his head resting between two pillows so that he does not injure himself on either side; and do not force him to chew any food yet; rather, let his food be cut into small pieces by a lion's paw (forbicio leon), until the pain has subsided and the jaws have become less stiff, at which point he may eat what he wants.
And that should be administered gently and without difficulty, without straining the opening of the mouth during eating, drinking, or speaking, until the jaw has regained its strength and healed.
And if it is difficult to reduce both jaws when they are dislocated at any time and have not returned to their proper places, then often times there are fevers and persistent thirst, and the belly of the patient is quickly inflamed, and pure bile is quickly vomited.
And when you see this, then you know that it is a perilous situation, and many times those who experience this die within 10 days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from its attachment to the chest wall due to its continuity with it; and sometimes it becomes dislocated on the outer side, which can be detected by touch.
And the treatment for this is that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. And then you should press on the area firmly with your palm because it will return (to its original position).
And then you should place a compress and cloth pillows on top of it, and strengthen it.
But the end of the muscle that is connected to the collarbone is not dislocated in any day; therefore, it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and according to your abilities.
And then you should place a compress and cloth pillows on top of it, and apply traction, and order the patient to maintain stillness and rest until it has healed.
And with this method of treatment, the end of the muscle is reduced when it has become separated from its proper place.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of a dislocated muscle.
You should know that a muscle is not dislocated unless it is in one of three ways, one of which is when it becomes dislocated from the base of the spine to the lower part.
And the second way is when the muscle becomes displaced above its location, which happens later, and it is not displaced to the back by the shoulder, nor is it displaced to the front by nerves.
And most often, it becomes dislocated and protrudes outside at the lower parts below the spine, especially in those with little flesh, it is easily displaced; but in those with much flesh, it is protruding outside with difficulty.
And quite commonly, hard knocks or falls cause abscesses in men, and the muscle becomes abscessed with abscess caused by a cautery, and is swollen because it has been dislocated.
Therefore, you should first apply that (the treatment) while it is still fresh on the affected area, and then proceed with the cure.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is in the lower parts because it feels numb; therefore, you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, for there is a clear difference between them. You will find, at the end of the muscle, a concavity like that of an egg, and when you touch the head of the muscle, it will feel numb to the patient, who will not be able to move his limb or perform any movement with it.
If it is dislocated in the foot or ankle, and you find a clear indication of this, and it is not hidden (or disguised).
And this dislocation can be easily reduced (corrected) when it is fresh, and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of the dislocation is as follows: the caregiver raises the patient's arm towards the upper parts of the body, and gently places their hands below the numb area, and lifts the joint with strength to its proper place, while holding the arm up, extending it outwards, and then gently placing it down so that it returns easily.
But if despite what we have said, it does not return to its proper place, and the dislocation has persisted for several days since it first occurred, then it is necessary that the patient should bathe in warm water and receive a poultice made of chickpea flour, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be administered.
And let the patient lie on his back and place a woolen compress soaked in liniment under the numb area, which should be of medium firmness. The doctor should then place his knee on the compress and lift the head of the muscle with strength, while pulling the patient's arm gently to avoid injury to the lower parts. Another caregiver should hold the patient's head so that it is not injured in the lower parts, for the numb area will soon return to its proper place.
And if you wish, you can reduce it (the dislocation) in the following way: have a person who is taller than the patient stand by his side and insert their muscle under the numb area of the patient and lift it up to the upper parts until the patient is suspended in the air. Another caregiver should pull the patient's arm downwards from below the abdomen. But if the patient is light, it is better to hang something heavy from him or have him suspended by some other means, in order to apply more force and reduce the dislocation quickly.
And the dislocation can also be reduced in another way: place a long stick on the ground with a round top like that of a pestle, neither too thick nor too thin, and then place the patient over it. Place a linen cloth over the top of the stick, and have the patient stand upright along the length of the stick, while extending his arm downwards on one side, and forcefully pulling his body straight on the other side, so that the joint returns to its proper place quickly.
And if the reduction of the dislocation is difficult for any of the reasons mentioned earlier, then use this treatment: take a stick that is two cubits long and four dites wide, with its thickness adjusted according to the size of the numb area as follows:
And place linen strips over the round top of the stick so that it does not harm the patient.
And place the numb area of the patient over the stick and extend their arm or hand over it towards the lower parts, and then bind the stick to the patient's body and limbs with bandages.
And let the arms be placed on a ladder step according to its width, with the hand extended downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended from the other side, so that the joint returns quickly.
And when the reduction of the dislocation is complete in any way possible, then it is necessary to place a woolen compress over the numb area of appropriate size, and apply an emplaster prepared from powdered mold (a type of clay) with vinegar and egg white over the entire muscle, which should be turned upwards. Also, place a tight bandage with moderate pressure over the compress, and bind the patient's hand to their neck, leaving it in this position for seven days without moving it.
And the patient's diet should be light until the affected limb is healed, as this will hasten the recovery process.
And let the patient's diet be gradually increased after seven or five days, and they should start to exercise the affected limb. If it is still firm and not softened, then it is already healed.
But if the joint is dislocated several times due to moisture or other causes, then it is necessary to apply cautery with three strokes in that area, as described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
And if all of this is done and after seven days the bandages are loosened and the joint is still not closed, and the emplaster and tight bandage have been removed several times, and it is still not closed and swollen, and the patient cannot raise their arm to the upper parts, then know that the nerves of the limb, which are located at the head of the muscle, have already been cut or stretched or weakened. And understand that the joint will never be able to return to its proper place.
The reduction of a dislocation in the foot or breast area or behind is achieved through impulsion and extension with the hands until it returns to its proper place.
And a tight bandage should be applied to that area and treated until it is healed.
And if there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement during healing, then the patient should bathe many times until the heaviness is relieved and it returns to its natural state.
Chapter 27.
Chapter 27: Treatment of Dislocation of the Hip
Know that the joint of the hip is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns to its place with difficulty. It can be dislocated in all directions, especially from the front to the back. The dislocation is not hidden from you because it is apparent when something heavy falls on it or when touched in any way it is dislocated. When you adjust a dislocated hip joint with your hand, it is clear that the joint is concave and cannot bend the leg or touch the muscle. This is evident because the joint is unable to flex or come into contact with the muscle.
Therefore, it is necessary to act quickly and reduce the dislocation before it becomes infected with an abscess caused by cautery (a medical procedure involving the application of a hot iron to create a blister). If the dislocation becomes infected with an abscess caused by cautery, reduction will be difficult and may result in permanent damage or even death, especially if it is located in the back. The back is the most dangerous location for all types of dislocations as they are more severe and painful, often leading to death if not treated promptly and correctly.
The restoration of the hip joint, when it is possible to reduce it, involves extending the patient's leg with two fists, expanding their arms, and placing the hands of the doctor over the hip and below it. The doctor then pushes the joint back into place using the knuckles of both hands together or with the edge of their palm until it returns to its proper location. It is important that this procedure is done carefully and skillfully to avoid further injury to the patient and ensure a successful reduction.
But if the dislocation is in the front, then it can be returned by bending the leg towards the chest and striking the hip with the edge of the hand or the palm to push it back into place. This should be done carefully and gently to avoid causing further injury to the patient. It is important that the doctor has experience and knowledge in reducing dislocations to ensure a successful and safe treatment.
If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then strong and forceful extension should be administered. This involves applying more pressure and force to move the joint back into its proper position. However, this should only be done by a trained medical professional who has experience in reducing dislocations. Using too much force or doing it incorrectly can cause further damage and even life-threatening complications. It is important to prioritize patient safety and seek medical attention as soon as possible for any suspected joint dislocation.
And it is that two caregivers extend the arms and hold the extension firmly in place to prevent it from being re-dislocated during the extension. This ensures proper alignment and reduces the risk of further injury or complications. It is important for multiple medical professionals to work together to ensure a safe and effective reduction. Communication, coordination, and careful attention to detail are crucial in successful joint reduction.
And let the arms be wrapped all around with long folded cloth or bandages over the patient's hand, covering it entirely. This will help stabilize and support the joint during the reduction process, preventing further injury or dislocation. It is important to use proper technique and equipment when reducing a dislocated hip joint to ensure a successful outcome. Communication and collaboration between healthcare professionals are also essential for safe and effective care.
And when the doctor touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil to facilitate lubrication of the joint and ease its return. Then push the joint vigorously until it returns. The use of oil can help reduce friction and make the reduction process smoother and less painful for the patient. It is important that the doctor applies the right amount of force and carefully monitors the patient's response to ensure a successful reduction.
And after the reduction of the hip joint, it is necessary to place it on a plaster that has stypticity and exsiccation with egg white, and to bind it tightly with moderate pressure. The arm should be suspended from the neck and left in this position for several days.
And after the reduction is successful, loosen the bandages and let it be. This means that if the joint has returned to its proper position, then it is time to remove the tight bandages and allow for mobility and healing. Proper assessment and monitoring are important in ensuring a successful outcome and preventing further injury or complications. It is essential to follow the medical professional's instructions carefully during the recovery period to ensure optimal results.
And if you see that the joint is not strengthening, then apply the plaster and bandage, and leave it on for several days until it dries out; and then unwrap it.
But if it happens that the reduction of the joint causes pain, and the person is in discomfort and moving around, then administer moist heat in the form of baths and gentle friction, and compression, until the pain subsides; or place a cushion of soft material over the joint to provide relief, and then bind it in place, leaving it on the bone day and night. Then place that (the affected area) in a bath; and when it is dry, then you should rub the joint with moderate friction, and then apply warm compresses to the area, one after another, three times. Corruption has already occurred in the dental enamel under the bathwater before it is rinsed off.
And if you wish, place it (the affected area) on a moist and shaved cow's split (possibly a piece of rawhide), and apply pressure with a bandage or strap on top of it; and do this several times, as the moisture helps to return it to its normal position.
Chapter 28.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
The dislocation of the hand is sometimes easy to treat, and its reduction is relatively simple; however, this is not the case with other joints. Nevertheless, it is important to act quickly in reducing the dislocation before the location becomes swollen or infected, leading to an abscess.
The reduction of the dislocation is as follows: place the patient's hand on a table and have them extend their arm. Then, place a cushion or the palm of your hand over the area just above the joint and gently push the joint back into its proper position.
However, it is important to consider whether the palm is facing the belly of the hand. If so, then the patient should place the back of their hand on the table for extension and reduction. If the dislocation is on the back of the hand, then the patient's hand should be placed with its inner side down on the table, allowing the doctor to push on the prominence of the joint.[x]
And then if it returns to its normal position quickly, that is good; otherwise, you should strengthen it with a yielding plaster to prevent abscess and leave it on. However, do not repeat this process, as it may interfere with the reduction of the dislocation, making it difficult or impossible to treat in the following days.
However, if the joint remains in its twisted position and the patient does not report any cause other than a feeling of weakness or inability to move their hand, it is likely that the nerves are trapped or torn. In this case, surgery may be required to release the trapped nerves and restore mobility to the affected limb. It is important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of such a procedure before proceeding.
Therefore, when the dislocation has been reduced, place a plaster on it as recommended and leave it in place for 5 days to heal and strengthen. Then remove the bandage and allow the patient to gradually begin moving their hand again, being careful not to overexert themselves.
However, if movement is restricted and there is pain or discomfort, gently apply warm water and gentle massage to the affected area until the pain subsides. This will help relax the muscles and promote healing, allowing for a faster recovery and a greater range of motion in the affected joint. It is important to be patient and persistent, as full recovery may take some time.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
Sometimes all the toes are dislocated in various places.
And when any of those toes are dislocated at the back of the palm or the belly of it, then you should stretch the toe and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the toe, and suspend it at the end where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And then suspend it (the toe) and stretch it until it is properly aligned in its place on that day.
And when it gets better at night, bind it (the toe) as described, and do not stop unwrapping it during the day and exercising with movement, and bind it again at night; and do this for several days until it becomes strong.
The same procedure should be followed if the hand is dislocated at the palm side, and it should be bound to that side, with the first operation being performed until it heals completely.
Similarly, do the same when it is dislocated in other parts (of the body).
Chapter 30.
This is the title of chapter 30, which focuses on the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae in the back. Dislocations of the spine can be particularly dangerous and debilitating, as they can affect the nervous system and result in paralysis or other serious complications. As such, medieval medical practitioners would have needed to exercise caution and expertise when treating these types of injuries.
When a dislocation occurs in one of the vertebrae of the back or neck and multiple vertebrae are displaced from their proper positions, there is no cure for this condition and death is imminent for the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excretion is expelled without their will and they cannot hold it in; and often their limbs or both sides of their body or one of those are weakened, or a vertebra has been displaced from its position, for often many have been displaced and often the removal of them has occurred in four directions.
Therefore, it has been displaced in the backward direction and is called gibbosity or hunchback.
However, the treatment for it is that you should consider whether the gibbosity occurred during childhood, for in that case there is no cure or healing for it at all.
However, in those that occur due to injury or trauma or similar causes, the ancients have already described the methods of treatment with lengthy discourse, from which the most important aspect is profitability; but I have shortened and abbreviated it from that, of which little needs to be said, as brevity is preferable and closer to a better explanation, which I have expounded and composed using various instruments, which I will show and expand upon here.
And those (gibbosities) are not cured except for the one that occurs in the back properly with what I have recommended.
And it is that the patient should lie on their front with a soft cushion under their chest and the area to be operated on uncovered and moistened with water or oil, so that the skin is not irritated by the instrument.
And place a straight rod should be placed, driven into the ground at the patient's feet near their head, and another rod at their other end by the feet.
The minister should hold the rod, and not be fixed in a pit; and another minister should hold the other one in the same manner.
And wrap around the patient's head, leaving enough space for breathing, and tie it securely with a bandage; then extend the end of the bandage to the rod that is near their head and tie it there; and then pull the other bandage over their hips, knees, and legs, and adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other rod that is by their feet.
And let each attendant extend their bandage to the part of the rod, and make sure that both rods and the bandages in their places where they are fixed are not loose, but rather not fastened as we have said before.
And the doctor places their palms with force over the spine until it returns, or they place a board under them and adjust their legs on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a table that is three cubits in length or width and make a hole in the wall near the patient where the end of the table can fit. And then place the tabletop on the spine and let the doctor place their feet on the other end, exerting force until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you want, use a drill that is rotated with the hand; and this means inserting two rods into the ground at the patient's head, one on each side of their head, each rod being one cubit long, and having a length of one palm between them. Each rod should have a hole through which a drill can be inserted, and they should be firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move.
And let there be a round rod with a drill at both ends of the two rods.
And at one end of it is a hole in which the rod fits, with a length of one palm and a drill at its other end, and similarly at the other two rods.
And then tighten the bandages that you have wrapped around the patient's feet at the hole near their head and the bandages that you have wrapped around their thighs at the drill that is by their feet.
And let there be a drill at each end and an attendant who turns it with their hand, while the doctor manipulates the spine as we have said before.
And once the spine has returned to its place and the wound has been cleaned, it is necessary to apply a dry poultice made of egg white and album, as well as cotton; then take a piece of wooden board with a length of three fingers or thereabouts, and long enough to cover the affected area near the spine.
And then it should be bound with the bandages that we mentioned earlier and let the patient take subtle nourishment until they are healed.
And if there is any remaining hardness in the area at the end of healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse with prolonged administration of the tablets that we have recommended; and a sheet of lead has already been applied to the affected area.
And sometimes it happens that hardness occurs in the lower spine due to dislocation; and this bone is called the coccyx, which should not be treated with this medicine because it can easily cause harm and even lead to death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint are not affected by minor displacement or concavity as in other small joints, but rather only by dislocation.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: at the inner parts, outer parts, front, or back.
And it is most commonly dislocated towards the inner parts, and less frequently towards the front or back.
And the sign of dislocation towards the inner parts is that when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the latter appears longer and more prominent than the former, and the patient cannot bend their knee as much as they can with the healthy leg. Additionally, there may be swelling in the area around the groin due to a cyst or abscess, which indicates that the head of the thigh bone has moved too far upwards.
The sign of someone who has experienced a dislocation towards the outer parts is that their symptoms are the opposite of those I described earlier.
The sign of someone who has experienced dislocation towards the front is that their leg extends straight out in front of them, but they are unable to bend it at the knee due to pain. They may also experience difficulty walking and have swelling or a cyst near the groin area. To treat this type of dislocation, the patient should be encouraged to walk with the aid of crutches or a cane.
The sign of someone who has experienced dislocation towards the back is that they are unable to extend their knee and there may be swelling or softness in the affected area. Additionally, the leg may appear shorter than the other and the head of the thigh bone may have moved upwards towards the back.
But in reducing this type of dislocation, one must consider whether the injury is old or new. If it is an old injury that has already healed and become stiff, then gentle manipulation should be used to realign the joint, taking care not to force it too much. However, if the dislocation is recent, stronger manipulation may be required, but only after administering pain-relieving medications.
But in the case of a recent dislocation that is one of the four types mentioned earlier, it is important to return the joint to its proper position and extend it both towards the inner and outer parts, as well as to the right and left. With gentle manipulation, the joint should easily return to its normal position without the need for further treatment.
But if the joint does not return to its proper position with gentle manipulation, it may be necessary to prepare for stronger treatment. Have an assistant extend the patient's leg downwards or hold their hands or use a bandage tied around the thigh to provide additional support. Another assistant should place their hand over the affected area and apply pressure to keep the soft tissues out of the way. A third assistant should use a bandage to apply firm pressure to the affected hip joint, while a fourth assistant holds the opposite end of the bandage to ensure proper tension.
And extension should be done either by pulling the leg towards the groin area at the level of the pubic bone or by pulling it backwards towards the spine.
And all these extensions should be done in one movement, so that the patient is raised from the ground and remains hanging.
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocations.
Therefore, if the joint returns to its proper position using the method I described, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to proceed with the specific treatment for each type of dislocation.
In reducing a dislocation towards the inner parts, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their side with the affected leg facing upwards. The bandages should then be placed over the hip joint in the space between the head of the thigh bone and the groin area, and then pulled upwards from the groin towards the pubic bone.
Have another assistant firmly grasp the patient's legs and pull them outwards with great force, which will help return the joint to its proper position.
This type of dislocation is easier to treat and reduce than the others.
But if the patient resists and does not cooperate with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie both their legs together firmly with a bandage around the ankles and knees.
And let each of his legs be the length of four fingers, and let the sick person's affected leg be extended more than the other by two fingers. (based on the context, "dits" likely refers to a unit of measurement, possibly referring to finger widths)
And let the patient be suspended over the top of the pole, and let them be in a sitting position; and let their distance from the ground be two arm lengths. (based on the context, "brasses" likely refers to an unit of measurement, possibly referring to the length of a person's outstretched arms)
And order a strong young man to reduce the dislocation of the thigh, and let him be suspended with the patient, and let another strong young man push against the thigh in order to quickly return it to its place, since forceful pushing is required for this procedure.
However, during the reduction itself, when there is a dislocation on the outside part, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back as we have recommended in the case of a dislocation, and let the ligaments be strengthened specifically on the affected leg and on the patient's chest. (based on the context, "pug" likely refers to a position where the patient lies on their back)
And let two poles be placed, one under the patient's feet and the other at their head; and let adjusted poles be placed in the middle of the bed on which dampened cloths have been wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between their thighs, ensuring that the extension to the lower parts is not restricted.
And let each minister stretch out on their side, and the doctor with their hand should guide the reduction according to the art (based on context, "the art" likely refers to medical knowledge or techniques).
And when the dislocation is on the front side, then it is necessary for the leg to be extended slightly, and this should be done according to the previous description on the bed; and let him place the palm of his right hand on the shinbone of the affected limb, and with the other hand squeeze it in order to constrict the area below the knee, and by squeezing with that constriction, move it towards the heel.
And if the dislocation is on the back side, then it is not necessary for the patient to extend their legs, and let them be raised from the ground; it is necessary that they are placed on a firm surface, just as is required in the case of elevation if the hip is dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said about positioning the patient on two sides; and let the face be upwards and the ligaments extended, as we have said, without delay.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a board on the area where the joint is located.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as necessary - and the sign of the reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them aligned and the patient relaxes their leg and stretches out their toes, then you know that the limb has been returned to its proper position - and then adjust two pillows and place a compress and stretch it with bandages so that the hip is not injured in any part; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
And then loosen the ligaments and compresses, and compare one leg with the other.
And then, if you see that they are aligned in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now stable, and at that point let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of swelling, then return and reapply the compress to that area, and stretch it according to your initial structure, and let it remain for three days.
And then undo that, and delay the patient's walking with crutches for several days, until they are comfortable.
Chapter 32. (This is a new chapter or section of the medical treatise)
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle. (based on context, "denolh" likely refers to the ankle joint)
The ankle can become dislocated in three ways: it can become dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and towards the back; but it does not become dislocated to the front.
And the sign of ankle dislocation is when you command the patient to flex their leg towards their hip, and if they are unable to do so, then know that the ankle is dislocated. (based on context, "cambas" likely refers to legs or thighs)
And the restoration of all types of ankle dislocation is to straighten the patient's leg so that they can extend it if possible, and then attach their heels to your thighs and place their foot between yours; and then hold the patient's ankle with both of your hands, positioning your fingers on top of the ankle joint with strength, and let another minister stretch out the patient's other leg so that the ankle returns to its proper position.
And the sign of successful reduction is when the patient's leg attaches itself to the hip with ease and without laborious effort. (based on context, "levitat" likely refers to lightness or lack of effort)
And then apply a compress to that area and let the leg attach itself to the hip, and then bind those limbs with one bandage for three or four days, and then undo those bindings.
And let the patient not use walking for several days until they are healed and comfortable. (based on context, "alcus" likely refers to several)
But if the reduction of the ankle is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with ligaments as described in the previous chapter on hip treatment. (based on context, "quin precedit narracio" likely refers to a previous description or chapter)
Chapter 33. (This is a new chapter or section of the medical treatise) [\-](https://heyingwen.com/2019/05/17/medieval-latin-or-old-french/)
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle can sometimes become swollen due to minor injury, and in some cases it becomes dislocated due to a complete displacement, and the dislocation of the ankle can occur either to the inside or to the outside.
And the sign of ankle dislocation is that you see the ankle bulging towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of ankle swelling from minor injury is of easy reduction, and it consists of extending the ankle with ease with the hands and guiding it back into place.
But in the treatment of a completely dislocated ankle, it is necessary to straighten the patient and have a strong and brave minister stand behind their back in the affected area.
And then place your right hand on the higher part of the foot and your left hand on the lower part of the foot at the level of the ankle joint. (based on context, "cavilha" likely refers to the ankle joint)
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and push with both of your hands twice, and stretch it out with your left hand; and push the toes of the foot with your right hand towards the patient's thigh without laboring. (based on context, "trebalh" likely refers to unnecessary effort or work)
And do that twice as we have said. (likely referring to the previous instructions given in the text) [-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://heyingwen.com/2019/05/17/medieval-latin-or-old-french/)
And then push the toes of the foot towards the thigh for the third time, and you are at the ankle joint. (based on context, "cavilha" likely refers to the ankle joint)
And so if it returns to its place in one or two times by this method, and you see the foot aligned, then that is good; but if not, then you should repeat the operation because it will return. (based on context, "it" likely refers to the ankle joint or dislocated bone)
But if you are prohibited from reducing it by the method we have recommended, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a folded cloth or soft object firmly on the ground under them, so that it is between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that they do not become injured. (based on context, "paysel" likely refers to a soft object such as a cushion or cloth, "ledesca" means to injure)
And let the minister hold the patient's thighs, and let another minister stretch out their leg with their hands or use a bandage to pull on the ankle; and let each minister stretch out against the extension of their own limb, and let the folded cloth be placed between the patient's thighs, holding it there so that the patient's body is not pulled downwards by the extension of their leg. (based on context, "liament" likely refers to a bandage or strap)
And let the doctor guide the reduction with their hands, and let another minister hold the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation will return easily. (based on context, "sieua" likely refers to the doctor's own limbs or hands)
And so once the dislocation has returned to its proper place and the success of the reduction is clear to you, then apply a compress and remove the bandage with force, and bind the leg to the thigh with a strong bandage. (based on context, "emplastre" likely refers to a medical compress or dressing)
And it is necessary that you be careful of the nerves which are located at the back of the ankle, because the bandage over that area should not be too tight and should not cause injury or damage to the nerves. (based on context, "nervis" likely refers to nerve endings in the ankle, "vehement" means tight or forceful, and "leda" means to injure)
And let it remain for two days or three; and if the bandage has become loose, then remove it. (based on context, "mollificat" means loose)
And let it be undone on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for 40 days. (based on context, "anament" likely refers to walking or standing) If it is necessary to go in front of that space, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be dissolved and corrupted, and that it will not receive cure.
And if a pustule has been cauterized, then it is necessary to administer to the wound, in the place where we previously described in our narrative, a remedy for treatment and for soaking, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated part be placed in a splint with minimal manipulation; and this is not difficult, it is rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in the joint of the second toe of the foot, then it is necessary to have the patient place their foot on a level surface or table, and remain still as if they were walking.
And then you should stand with your weight on the patient's foot, placing your own foot near the joint, and press down firmly with your foot until it returns to its proper position, observing that it is now properly aligned and not protruding in any way.
And then place a board under the patient's foot that supports the entire foot, with two ends, and secure it with a proper and firm stretching for three days; and then release it and allow the foot to rest from walking for several days, until it is strong and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
On the types of dislocation that are caused by wounds, or fractures, or a combination of both.
When any of these causes occur, and you attempt to treat the injury and restore it, many times death will result.
And so one should not be overconfident in treating such injuries, but rather the wise and experienced physician, full of mercy and compassion, slow to act, cautious and humble, should use medicines that only cauterize abscesses at first, and then leave the patient to the divine judgment. But one should entrust their salvation from perdition, as well as relief from illness, to the one in whom they have hope for recovery, and in whom they see some signs of improvement. And so one should strive to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible at the onset of the injury, before abscesses form.
And if the limb returns to its proper position as desired, then administer a regimen that will prevent abscesses from forming and treat the wound with dry bandages as appropriate.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you should align their position and do as we have said in simple injuries that were described earlier in this text.
And take care to avoid and prevent any further damage to the affected area, within the limits of your ability, as I have previously advised in my teachings; for this will bring you closer to your Creator, be more enduring for your glory, and truly benefit your health in your lifetime. Thus ends the words of Albucasis perfectly, may God bless him. Indeed, amen. May the wisdom and knowledge contained in these teachings bring healing and health to all who seek it, now and for generations to come.
