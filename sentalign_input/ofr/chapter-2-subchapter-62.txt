of fleshy hernia
Aqueous hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white syfac, which is below the shell of the testicles, that contains the testicle;
and is called "syfac", and sometimes it is actually within the lining of the testicle, so that one thinks it is another testicle;
and it is the skin of the scrotum between the white syfac that we have mentioned;
and this occurs infrequently.
And the development of this hernia comes from weakness in the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this fluid has many colors:
either a color tending towards jaundice, or it is blood red, or black, or watery white, and this occurs more often;
and these are the signs to recognize this gathering, for if it is in the white syfac (hydrocele) that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is not visible, because there is fluid all around it.
And if there is fluid in the tunic itself, the abscess is round with part of the testicle, and because of this, it is thought to be another testicle;
and if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunic, it can be felt easily;
then when you want to know the color of the fluid, examine it with the square intromissor, the shape of which is shown above.
According to what comes out after the intromissor, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron (cautery), the patient should be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body;
then have him lie on his back, on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the penis to one of the two testicles from the heart of the scrotum;
then take the milk-white spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the base to near the tip, and let your incision be perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the scrotum down to the white tunic, and peel it back subtly as much as possible;
then pierce the tunic full of water with a large hole, and draw out all the water, then insert your hooks and stretch the tunic upwards;
and do not touch the testicle itself, only the tunic;
cut it all or in pieces likewise the thickened part of it delicately, because if you do not cut it carefully, the water will return;
and if the testicle happens to be outside during your work, replace it when you have completed the work on the tunic;
then bring together the two edges of the testicle with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, to prevent the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle along with the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if fluid is collected in two parts together, know that these are two branches;
then cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
and above put other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it on the two testicles, and put on top folded cloths, and tie it up with the bandage that is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness, and let them be joined by stitching at the opening of the pants, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks up to the back, and the other to the penis area;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the bandage be gathered in the buckle of the pants;
and sometimes this ramification is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and you should take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white membrane that contains the water is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce this membrane with hooks, and peel it off with this thin, hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you extract it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this method is safer;
and with less risk of bleeding, and better than surgery; 
and if anything gives you trouble, like a hot abscess or bleeding or something else, treat that which troubles you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid, and does not want to endure this procedure because of its dreadfulness, then perform a perforation, as I tell you, which is, when you are quite certain by the signs we have described that there is watery pus there, have the patient sit on a raised seat;
then pierce the abscess in the lower part with the spatula wide open, and position the perforation lengthwise along the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the liquid runs out freely;
then put cotton on the area, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining liquid, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the liquid to flow from the opening of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument used to draw liquid from dropsical patients, the form of which is shown above;
and widen the wound a little, and know that the liquid will return, and accumulate again after six months or around then, and when it has accumulated as before, the patient will continue this way throughout his life.
