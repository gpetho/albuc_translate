It is necessary to first purify his brain with major purges and with all the treatments that we mentioned in the section if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medications.	When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.82178223
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate the medications, then he should use gargles and masticatories that purify the brain for many days before that, along with improving his nutrition, then shave his head, then cauterize him with a single cauterization in the middle of the head as described previously, and another cauterization on his posterior, and a cauterization on each side of his head.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.8021239
If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauterizations that were mentioned for the one with paralysis and body relaxation on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity.	0.58513093
