The first chapter on cauterizing the head with one cauterization.	CHAPTER ONE. On the single cauterization of the head.	0.7422178
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness on the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent catarrh from the head towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, throat aches, and in general, for every disease that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, muteness, and similar ailments.	This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.	0.914333
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habit. Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then sit him cross-legged between your hands, having placed his hands on his chest. Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is like this:	The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient. Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast. Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink. Then heat an olivary cautery.	0.9219616
Expose from the bone the size of a toothpick head or the size of a cherry pit, then lift your hand. Otherwise, repeat with the same iron or another one if it has cooled down, until you see the bone as I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak cotton in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the burn from the fire disappears. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until he recovers, God willing.	If you see that some bone is exposed, the size of the head of a skewer or a grain of vetch, then take your hand away; otherwise repeat with the same iron, or, if that has got cold, with another, till the amount of bone I have mentioned is exposed. Then take a little salt dissolved in water; soak some cotton in it, apply to the place and leave for three days. Then apply some cotton soaked in butter and leave it on till the eschar falls off; then dress with Tetrapharmacum ointment till healed.	0.86411846
They have said that the longer the wound remains open and suppurates, the better and more beneficial it is.	The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.	0.7870519
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then the burned part of the bone is scraped, and then treated.	Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt. Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.	0.9216146
Others have said that the cauterization should be exaggerated until it has a strong effect on the bone, so that something like a carat or a small disk falls off the bone. They claimed that it vents the vapors of the head from that place, and the wound is left open for a long time, then treated until it heals.	Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place. The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.	0.8669294
I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people, and by way of risk, and leaving it is better in my opinion. And safety, if it exists, is because the head weakens when its natural connection is severed, as we have seen in other organs, especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so work with it, and you will be safe, God willing.	But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky. In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be. For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature. In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.	0.85846865
