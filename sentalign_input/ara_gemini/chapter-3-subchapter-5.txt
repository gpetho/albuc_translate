The fifth chapter on the reduction of the clavicle if it is fractured
The clavicle is most often fractured from the front at the end of the shoulder.
Its fracture takes one of three forms: either it breaks and splits in two without producing fragments, which is the easiest to reduce; or fragments occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to reduce; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
The procedure in it, if the fracture is without a wound, is to bring two assistants, one of whom stabilizes the arm next to the fractured clavicle and the other extends the neck toward the other side.
Then you straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape becomes as it should be, and there is no protrusion or curvature in it.
If you need more extension, it is appropriate to place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit, its size being according to your need, and you extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is straightened as it should be.
If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has gone deep, it is appropriate for the patient to lie on his back and a medium-sized pillow be placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downward until the clavicle bone that is deep rises up, then at that time, fix the fracture and straighten it with your fingers
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and has started to move, it is appropriate to make an incision over it and remove that fragment gently.
If the fragment is trapped in the bone, be clever in cutting it with one of the cutters that you have prepared for this purpose, after the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument made of wood or iron, has been placed under the clavicle, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a curvature, its width depending on the size of the bone you need, and its length depending also on what allows you to work, and let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the tear in the wound that you made when removing the bone fragment is wide, and you are safe from a hot swelling, bring together the lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the tear is small, or you fear a hot swelling, pack the wound with bandages and pads according to the extent of the wound's opening.
If a hot swelling appears, soak the bandage in rose oil and vinegar or wine, and apply it on it.
As for bone setting, if it is without a wound or incision, it is that you apply on the bone the poultice made from mill dust with egg white, and place the soft compress on it, then place the ball under his armpit if needed.
Then take a turban that is very long and its width is a span or so.
Then apply a folded pad on the compress and poultice.
Then take a splint from a thin board whose width is three fingers and its length is likewise.
Then insert it into a cloth.
Then insert that cloth with the splint in the place of the turban that falls on the site of the fracture.
Then tighten the turban over the fracture as it goes around, and wrap it on his neck, under his healthy armpit, and under his affected armpit, and bring it back times on each side, however you see that the tightening sets the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the key to it all is that the splint does not move from the broken bone, and therefore it is necessary that you check the patient every day, so whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, fix that and tighten the bandage.
Then make the patient sleep on his back and put a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night so that his arm is raised from his side, so the clavicle fracture is raised by raising the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is an incident in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the poultice if you see reason for that, and repeat the tightening, and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and sets.
And it becomes stronger and firmer than that in twenty-eight days, and it may be in some people in less than that.
