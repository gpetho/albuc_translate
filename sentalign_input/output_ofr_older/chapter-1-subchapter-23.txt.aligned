When moisture prevails over the channels of the lung, especially when it comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be emptied by purgative medicines; afterward make a cautery at the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and burn only a little of the core. Afterward make another cautery at the junction of the neck to the top of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile" whose shape we mentioned earlier; and treat the area as we mentioned earlier until healed.	When humidities prevail over the windpipe, and especially when there is a frigid temperament, the patient should first have his bowels opened with a laxative. Then cauterize him once in the hollow of the jugular fossa at the root of the throat in the hollow part. Take care that the cautery does not pierce through to the gullet, and burn no more than half of the thickness of the skin. Then cauterize him once more, strongly, at the junction of the neck with its last vertebra, the cautery being claviform as described above.	0.8214705
