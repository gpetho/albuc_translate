Chapter ninety-three, on incising the illness that is known as an abscess.	CHAPTER NINETY-THREE. On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'.	0.764192
This disease, which is called "al-nafir" in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the limbs, then moves from one limb to another, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.	The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.	0.74177504
I was called to a sick woman in one of the rural areas, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of the forearm, and after an hour passed I saw that swelling crawling along the ulna as a worm crawls, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as could be, like mercury when it flows from place to place.	I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein. After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place.	0.83776534
So the pain went away from that place and settled in the shoulder.	Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow.	0.9040914
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout the body until it went into the other arm.	Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm.	0.7868555
So if you want to treat it and its possessor feels the pain, if it appears to you visibly as we mentioned, then tie tightly above it and below it with haste and incise upon it until that trapped wind comes out and cauterize the place.	When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place.	0.8163035
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with that which expels the winds and disperses them, such as asafoetida seeds and sagapenum seeds and similar medications.	But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.	0.7503723
