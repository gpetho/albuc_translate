 CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO.
On cauterization of gangrene.
 Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.
Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains.
Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.
Then treat with stimulating ointments.
If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good.
Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.
Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily.
I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.
