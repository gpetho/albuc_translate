Chapter Seventeen.
On Cauterizing the Fistula That Appears at the Corner of the Eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the sections on diseases and your treatment is not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You order the ill person to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head in front of you, holding it so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium seed husks on his eyes, then you heat the cautery, which is pictured here.
It is hollowed out like a tube of eagle feathers on one end, which is used for cauterizing, and if you wish, it can be open on the other end, and if you wish, it can be solid like a probe, except that this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then you squeeze the fistula if it is open and the pus comes out of it and you dry it, or if it is not open, you open it and extract its pus, then at that time you place the cautery on it, and it is very hot, and you hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand does not err or the patient becomes agitated, and the cautery falls on the corner of the eye and ruins it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop, otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if you need to.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with oil to it, and treat it with the desiccating ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply the sharp, corrosive medication to it until the bone is exposed and scrape it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method for cauterizing fistulas mentioned by some of the predecessors is that you treat the site of the fistula by incising it, then you place a thin funnel into the incision itself. This is its image.
And you pour into it the equivalent of a dirham's weight of molten lead, and you hold the funnel firmly in your hand, tight and secure, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead spill into his eye. And it is necessary to put cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye. 
Indeed, the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we mentioned, then fine. Otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and redirect the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be discussed in its specific section.
