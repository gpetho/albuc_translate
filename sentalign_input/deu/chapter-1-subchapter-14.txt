Chapter Fourteen:
On the Cauterization of Nasal Fetor.
When treatment for nasal fetor as previously mentioned in the division proves ineffective, prepare and administer purgative pills for three nights. Then shave the patient's head and cauterize with an olive-shaped cautery.
Next, cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery on both eyebrows just below the hairline.
Be careful not to incise the artery.
The form of the nail-shaped cautery is as described.
