of large hanging swellings
Sometimes thelul occurs in the abdomen and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "funge" because of its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and the head large; and there are small ones and very large ones; and I saw a man who had two in his abdomen that were more similar to fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were already split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found in one eighteen ounces in weight, and in the other six and a half, and the procedure for the incision is that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist and of a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready in your presence.
For during cutting, excessive bleeding often occurs, and if the blood overcomes you, then hurry to cauterize; and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead wire, and tie the growth with it as we have said, and leave it for two days; and then tighten it, and do not stop tightening the lead wire until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without difficulty; and if the roots are thick, be careful when cutting, especially in the abdomen, but you can certainly cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul that is pale in color and weak in appearance and milky in aspect. 
For it is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.
