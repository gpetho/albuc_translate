On the treatment of the dislocation of the fingers.
Chapter 30.
When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, or one of the fingers toward the back or the inner side of the hand, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, suspend it toward the side to which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it until it aligns straight on that day.
Then at night, bind it according to the instructions; during the day, keep unbinding it, exercise it with movement, and bind it at night.
Do this for several days until it becomes firm.
Similarly, if it dislocates toward the inner side of the hand, bind it toward that side, and perform the initial procedure until it heals.
And do likewise when it is dislocated toward other parts.
