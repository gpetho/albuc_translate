Praefatio.	 Praise
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have finished this book with you, my sons, which is in the aftermath of medicine's science and complete, having reached its end by examining it from his explanations and his declarations; thus has been given to me that I may finish reading it along with you as a part of surgery, namely, hand surgery.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since the operation has been completed in our region and at our time, unless knowledge of it was lost by mistake or a deliberate act; unless descriptions have not been recorded in ancient books that were copied out by hand: and thus there was an error and a waste until the intentions of him were set forth; and prolonged thereafter. It is given to me so that I may execute her along with this Treatise according to its terms, as described above from positions, declarations, and abbreviations: and so you will come back in forms of tools for Cautery, and the remaining instruments of works: until it is clear by declaration addition or by his proper statement what should be necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 On the other hand, because the art of medicine is long and requires its author to exercise before that in knowledge of anatomy is described by Galenus; until he knows how members are connected together, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, veins, and vessels, and numbers of them, and their exit from it, and pulsations of the arteries, quietness, and places where they go out.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And Hippocrates said that a name with its name is much; but the hand of art is small and especially in the art of surgery.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already spoken about it when entering into this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since he who is not known what we spoke about anatomy does not enter and falls into an error from which men suffer; just as I have heard many of those who are formed in this science, but do not practice it without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 "That happened because a medical student cut through the veins of a woman's neck and caused blood to flow from her; this ultimately led to her death.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 "I saw another medical student who took pride in extracting a stone from the bladder of an old woman; after that, the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 "Therefore he punished him by removing his beard with scissors.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 "This is why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 "And I too had spoken to him about removing it; and I saw that there was a large stone in his bladder, which would lead to death.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 "And I saw another medical student who was treating a man from Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicam; and he injured the eunuch with black hands (possibly due to anger), which were near his heels; after that, the doctor bound up the fracture on top of them using rope, sticks, and strong cloth. But they did not release his breath.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 "Then he was relieved by his desire to get away.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 "After that he released him on several days and said to him, 'Don't let the rope out,' and he stayed there until his wrists were loose, and then he led him to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 "I therefore spoke to him about removing the rope; after that there was tranquility, and he experienced relief from his suffering.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 "However, already corruption had been confirmed in his member; I couldn't stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 "Therefore the corruption ceased to walk around in his member until it ended.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 "And I saw another medical student who cut off the cancerous tumor; and he was infected after some days, until great malice came with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 "That is because when the cancer is pure due to melancholy at that time it does not need to be burned with iron entirely unless there's something inside of him that allows him to live.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Because of this the sons need to know that a surgical operation is performed with two divisions; for one it associates health and the other has peril associated with many divisions
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 I have already explained this in another chapter of this book where there is terror and fear involved
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it's necessary for you to remember this so that they don't get confused and may not fall into the trap of speaking or being dishonest
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Take care of yourselves with diligence and security; support the weak and the infirm with kindness and firmness so that you may be guided to a better inheritance through grace from God towards salvation and blessed succession: remove terrible anxieties and difficult healings, and let go off your souls when they fear it, so that the desire for conversion may come upon you in trust and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 It will be more beneficial to your glory and higher in this world as well as ultimately on the quantities of yours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen has already said it in certain his own statements.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not cause harm to yourself, for you are the best doctors of your bodies.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 I am about to divide this Treatise into three Chapters

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The book of surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 On the first part
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 To begin with, concerning the cutting of flesh and bones, the manner in which it is performed, at what time and whether using iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Concerning the opening (of an incision), when to start it, how much depth should be made initially, and where
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before starting an operation concerning the cutting of flesh and bone, it is necessary to mention (the quality) of the instruments used; this should be noted down. And what kind of incision reveals the complexion?
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore, I will say that regarding the quality of instruments used in cutting flesh and bone, this is a long, short, knowledgeable, and hidden
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Having spoken on the quality of instruments used for cutting flesh and bone, they have made their decisions; to me, however, only a few things from what was said are sufficient.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore, I will say that cautery is universally applied to all kinds of flesh where there is no material substance; and for the two types mentioned earlier: one which is hot without any material substance and another which is dry without any material substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 But regarding the cold type and the dry type with a material substance, they have spoken.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 And someone said that cautery is useful (in this situation).
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of this, namely that cautery is not useful for cutting into a cold substance which is both hot and dry; because nature is (hotness) is heat.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 The one who said the opposite of this mentioned that cautery can be useful for cutting into all cold substances which are both hot and dry; because when you compare a human body to its moisture, and you look at the complexion of fire on it, then the body becomes (cold).
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 I will say this through his words because from my experience that has already happened to me a certain number of times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless do not let him enter here until he is already tried and practiced (in the art of cautery), has exercised himself thoroughly at that point, and knows about the variety in complexion among people, their disposition towards heat, causes them to occur, accidents they cause, and time periods during which they happen.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 Other veins have no fear of you: especially those of cold and moist
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 All the physicians have used them, but did not fail when Cautery was applied to them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And it is known by the sons that from Cautery secret treatment with fire and kindness to him when accompanied with medicine burns well because fire alone action not succeeded unless the part burned: and does not hurt another member with it, except painer.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 The action of physicians was done to that which grows from the members: and sometimes it causes to strike in the difficult recovery member, and sometimes it weakens.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire because of his subtlety and substance goodness does not do that, unless excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 We did not discover that by experience, for the length of services and study with art and position over integrity people's: and because of this excuse out of the sermon in length.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if not for this book of mine, we would reveal to you the secret hidden by fire and the quality of its operations in removing its own body, which expelled the fears through a philosophical demonstration speech that agreed with your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And it is known by the sons that these dissent at a time when Cautery was agreed to be done, and they consider it as better than any other time of yours.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that Cautery is agreed at all times: therefore the pain caused by time is overcome when brought with Cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if Cautery is for the pains from necessary pain, strong, winter, who does not tolerate delay: therefore because of it, it is feared by those, that caused malice greater than what was previously called as a result of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And it does not remain in the minds of your sons except the ignorant and foolish physicians who consider that by Cautery healed is not a remedy always: and they consider it as a result, but are not like them; therefore because Cautery is not, unless on medicine's place which changes complexion, and dries the moisture that causes pain.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, it is necessary to apply cautery over medicine for the benefit of its own application and effectiveness, as well as that of his master. It is possible that he may find a shortage at some time due to the lack of one or another ingredient from which he prepares the operation; therefore, we must provide him with this lack in order to be able to administer cautery.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 Subtile deficiency of the member (or limb) from which there is a lack of excess moisture and humidity, such as with dental cautery for pain relief, it is possible that he will not experience any pain in this area.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 However, this would only happen over time.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 The correct sequence of the utterance is as follows: "After the application of medicine comes a speech which should be made once (immediately after) - this one refers to the treatment itself and what was intended in that person; because they believe that the treatment does not confer benefits with medicines or post-cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 However, this is contrary to the correct sequence of events - when we apply the cures in a specific ingredient, they do not confer the benefits of medicine; after that, we administer the treatment at the end and provide it: then, from that point on, the application of cautery after medicine no longer follows the intended order as understood by most people.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 They have said that cautery with gold is better than cautery using iron; they did not say this however, unless the reason for their preference was equal in quality and value of gold; they have stated that it does not make a bad place for cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 This is not absolutely true because I have already tried this and tested it; however, what that thing does to some bodies but not others cannot be determined.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 Cautery with him is a benefit, better than using iron as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However when you apply cautery to fire within fire without declaring it as such and the amount of heat is unknown because of the burn on the skin; and if added fire above that point ignites and causes great pain, and results in burns.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Because of this injury to the craftsman in his craft; and because of that there should be Cautery (a surgical technique) performed using fire near us as soon as possible and close by for performing an operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I too have ordered this chapter on Cautery according to the chapters; and ordered it from the head down to the feet so that those seeking what is done by him may find it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 How to perform Cautery (a surgical technique) on the head at the hairline
Caput II.	 The head, part 2
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 This Cautery causes the control of moisture and cold on the brain: which two are caused by; and abundance of flux from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and pain in teeth, and pain in the throat: and universally all injuries caused by cold as paralyze, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ones.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The Cautery method is to perform it quickly; so that the remedy with a solution of fire may first be applied three times during the night or four if needed by virtue and his age, and by custom
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then tell him to wash it off immediately.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 After that have him sit between your hands flat so that his hand has already been placed on top of the chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Whenever your middle finger reaches that point, mark it with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then Cautery of Oliver should be applied whose shape is this one.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 After that place it on the marked spot slowly with ink so that your hand can be drawn back gently and you remove it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 "Firstly, take your knife and put it aside.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 "After that, if you have already cut off a head or the back of your hand, then take away your knife.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 "If not, put the knife back and wait for them to show you your bones which I have given you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 "Then pour something from the sale and place it into water, drink it yourself, put on your head and leave after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 "Then pour something from the sale onto your head and remove it after three days until the charcoal is burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 "After that, take care of yourself with the ointment and apply it often enough to heal.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 "They said this is better because more pus comes out when the wound is opened and emitted by it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 "They said some people do this to the skin up to the mouth and hold a cautery until the bones of the spit are gone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 "After that is applied to the wound then it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 "Others say that it is necessary to cauterize with a cautery until the end so that there will be no impression of blood in your mouth and the mouth will die as if cut off by a knife or an instrument made for women which are dipped into alpha-betic parum: they also say, when you exhale from this place, you lose hair on the head and it must heal after opening for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 "After that, then it is cured until it becomes solid.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 "But I do not see two kinds of cauteries universally except among some people based on fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 "I remove it and it is better with the health of them.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 "This weakness of the head from a natural solution is continuous and consistent with our experience on other parts of the body especially when it is weak by nature and the species cautery are best and better among us to use them.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 To cauterize one's head for the benefit of the entire head
Caput III.	 The third book
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 Chronic pain affects the entire head when an injury occurs to it; and prolonged this in weakness, is used by the elderly, the disabled, the young, and the middle-aged.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And particularly if one has already been cauterized with a cautery, we do not apply anything to him from these; but then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head is naturally strong and not weak, but rather has a good constitution; then we cauterize it with another cautery beneath that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then we cauterize his head with all the veins of his own head with another cautery, so that no wound shall pass over the skin and an estimate is made of the quantity from the bone which we mentioned earlier.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And we cauterize him with a single cautery at the place where that one is mentioned; and it is the site to which he was bound up before, and take your oath on this, and do not disclose his mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 Weak then was affected by that chronic pain of the head because its cautery is not as strong as those of all heads.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I tell this Cautery at its place; and it must be the Cautery which is used to cauterize the veins of the head, and done gently with a Cautery beneath that one for the middle aged.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is how he was made

Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain occurs to part of the head and also extends it to the eye; or when prolonged until it reaches an exhausted state, and is treated with medical substances on the head, and additional care is given to it for its treatment, which I mentioned earlier in the division into stages of exhaustion: then cauterization in him takes place according to two ways.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 Cauterization with a hot implement is necessary if there's an acute infection, to remove one tooth at the same time and cut off its roots, also amputate both of his limbs from two sides
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Once the location of pain is found while holding a needle, let them make that spot underneath where you can catch hold of it
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 After that, hold him down underneath the oil with a sponge and cure it from there
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you want to do that using some of the medicines I wrote about in the 12th book on remedies for hemorrhoids.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 Cauterization with iron is necessary, as well as any other hot implement.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The shape of the cautery tool used for this purpose is a cone
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 The shape of it's called the Claw because its form is like a claw with an eminence in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 After that, hold him down on the spot and keep your hand steady: also heat iron gently with a wick and make its quantity as you would give out skin fat, just like his endurance.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And take hold of your hand to prevent the artery from being damaged and to stop the bleeding.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 After that, put him under water with salt and hold down on the spot: later on cure it using oil; after that, cure it gently using an ointment.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you want to do this for a stroke with the help of a second cautery tool.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And when doing so on an artery during a stroke, it's not just an ordinary task.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 Cauterization for this purpose is different from the one used before.
Caput V.	 The top of V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you cure a stroke, as for the treatment of that ailment before and regarding the divisions of blood vessels, except in cures; do not forget to cure it: and if you find out from pain lines that are above the spot with the length of your fingers or like this: also hold his hand down until you hit an artery and pull it right up to his mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to cut off the continuation of the jaw that moves forward during chewing so as not to obstruct its passage or get stuck in its way and cause a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And this is with caution and care for the flow of blood in arteries that has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For the cutting of it (the artery) is frightening for him who did not know what he was doing or was not diligent and experienced enough, so that the surgical procedure with him should be performed first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I am remembering the regulation of blood flow from an artery according to its own way and at its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Which if you do not see through a hemorrhage (bleeding), that which is not enough for him to the cautery and you see the body of the nurse to tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head as we did with care, until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you are given a cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of arteries with a pair of tweezers holding it.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 The cautery is therefore better and more useful for this purpose.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Regarding the way of cautering with the ears of a person.
Caput VI.	 Sixth part
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When an earache occurs with cold and is treated with solutions of herbs as we said it would be done in the previous part, and does not disappear, then use the cautery; this thing which is called a dot (puncture) has its shape like that one.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the dot with it after its ignition is applied to the whole circumference of the ears as we have mentioned; or else apply it in both sides if the pain occurs on both sides at once.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And after you have used the tweezers to the root of the ears as much as possible, when you have marked out its location with wax; and there are ten dots on every ear, or nearly so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then cure the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Regarding the way of cautery for torture
Caput VII.	 On the head
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Torture that is treated by cauterization only occurs when the burns are caused by contact with fluids, as stated earlier in the division of burning injuries.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And if there is no application of cautery, it will happen due to burns caused by friction or from a spasm in the nerves.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this kind of torture with honey and burnings on the head and neck, and gargling, but if your cure does not come to pass, then it is necessary that cautery be applied by three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another below in time from its own height, and thirdly at the junction of two arms.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your Cautery on the opposite side of a weak person.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Although the soothing does not happen unless it is applied to the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cautery is that you apply Cautery directly to the top of the ear, as it was described earlier.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 Place your hand with the Cautery until a medium amount of fire has burned off the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of Cautery, and it is species by contact with a thing that has been described earlier. However, although not inferior to others in subtlety, but it should be placed so as to burn off excessive fat only.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then, cure the sick person with what preceded it until they recover completely.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 The manner of Cautery for ancient apoplexy
Caput VIII.	 On the head
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When ancient apoplexy occurs and your cure does not come to pass, but the patient has no fever, then apply Cautery by four Cauteries on each of his headcorns, Cautery in the middle of the head, as stated earlier, Cautery at the occiput of the head, according to what preceded it.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 "The cautery is applied over the stomach with a cautery.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 "Then it was cured, as before
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 "The cautery is applied to the belly button.
Caput IX.	 "Head number nine
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 "It is intended to puncture the water bag on its belly with a large syringe and to release the brain's fluid.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 "Then he will remove the head completely and place it on a cloth described in the treatise on cloth placement; then he places him (the head) once.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 "The method of cautery is as follows: and do it according to the order mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 "If so, it is good
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 "If not, he applies the third cautery to the back of his head, which is descent from the top of the head down to the bottom of the eye; and puts between every large cautery a certain amount of digit.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 "Then it was cured, as before
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 "If you add an increase to him and he is tolerant of that; then do the cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 "Then if you add more, it will cauterize over two ears
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 "Then cure him; and the cautery should be applied according to its form which was previously mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 "The cautery is applied in paralysis, with mollification.
Caput X.	 "Head number ten
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 "It was intended that you proceed to the brain's fluid with your syringe and as before.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 "Then he will remove the head and apply a cautery to its middle part; and a cautery above every ear, over all of his ears, over three on the spine of his neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 "If you are weakened by many and excessive bodily pains; and if he is tolerant of it but has great strength in his fearfulness: then apply him four cauteries to the back of his spine; and last with a cautery until all the most extreme pain is consumed, and release your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Therefore take care of it, so that it may be healed; and with Oil of Olive

Caput XI.	 Chapter 11
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 During an attack (Epilepsy) do not use fire; except for those whose Epilepsy is caused by discharge of phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 And let it be done for the brain of him primarily with water and with other treatment as we have prescribed in the last chapter; when he is in a state to be treated gently or if he is to accept medical care.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If the child does not tolerate medicines, then apply a mixture of water and emetic to cleanse his brain in advance over several days along with nourishing food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then treat his head after that manner of cauterizing as described before; and another cautery is applied to the upper part of his head, and over every hair of his head there will be a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If he is weak and still tolerates it, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I prescribed in his having paralysis; and soothing to the body over the collarbones and shoulders; and also on the back of the spine: And let there be Oil of Olive as before.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the causes of Melancholia are damp and thick phlegm; then cauterize him with the cauteries that I prescribed in his having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the causes of Melancholia are an excess of declivity to Melancholia and his body is wet with moisture; then give him in a pot what will cleanse his brain as before: then treat his head gently after that; and make afterwards a tortellini from linen, like a ring.

When it is declared to you the beginning of water through a sign that I showed you previously, then start and let him dry with his head first, after rinsing well with what he made wet it.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And protect him from all liquids, and let him stay in the bath for a certain number of days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Indeed prepare it so that he can remove his own head, and burn him gently from head to toe.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Indeed burn him with two fire-makers or two hooks, if the descent of water into both eyes is simultaneous; or from one side if it descends into only one eye; and cease all veins and arteries that are under the skin, which are short in latitude; and make the cauterization long through the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 Which if you see something from it, then cease him immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I always when wisdom that is in the extraction of arteries, and their removal, and caution to the flow of blood.

Caput XIIII.	 The twelfth part
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When tears of the eyes are ancient and dried up: and are located above the ears, and arteries that are external to the head, it is necessary to burn this with cold fluids; then you must burn using a cautery in the middle of the scalp: and two cauteries over the two temples: and two cauteries below each ear.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if there are additional wounds, then you must burn it with a cautery on all sides of the eyes, above the eyebrows using another cautery.

When you treat this one, along with what we said in the previous section and do not give a treatment; then immediately afterward, provide three nights' rest to him: afterwards shave his head and burn it using a cautery on both sides of the nose.

Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the palm of the eyes is softened by dust or humidity: then burn it with a cautery using one, along with another one for the moon.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if there is another wound, burn it above two of the eyebrows and spread out by two blows; and the length of all the cauteries will be according to their height: and you may not cut off your hand using a cautery unless there is something that has been applied on the third palm.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 This is how the burning of Claudius works in this way for the moon.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 "With the palm with hairs prickled on the eyes.
Caput XVII.	 The seventeenth head
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 In this [the seventeenth head] there are two ways to apply a cautery, either with fire or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 When applying the cautery with fire, before doing so, take care to cleanse [the body part] beforehand in order that any hairs it may contain are burned off, unless those hairs are growing and thus prolonging their duration until they become equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If one is cauterizing the body part around its own location [the area where it was applied], then hold his eyes with a clamp or something similar so that they do not move until they are born [i.e., burned].
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 After they are born and equalized [i.e., after the cautery has burned off their hairs], then place the head of your instrument gently in its own place. Next, apply a wax seal to his eyelids with a seal that corresponds to the shape of dead leaves, so as to indicate when it is time to remove them. And let this be the first sign [in removing the hairs] towards the roots.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 After that you place the head of your instrument soaked in alum or mucilage over his eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 And after a while when another cautery is needed it will be used to remove any remaining hairs.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 And when you have finished applying this seal over the figure that you marked out just now on his eyelids until the surface of the skin has been burned like a shape made from dead leaves completely and entirely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And this is the seal of your work on medicine so that if you have already marked out the eyelid with a seal and it is time to remove the hairs from around the point of the eye, then let the hairs be removed at the point of the eye itself.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 And then you use your hand in that moment and remove it after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 After this place the head of your instrument soaked in butter over him until all trace has been removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 And after that care for him with unguent so that he may be cured.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If anything is released after the hairs have been burned off at this time and he becomes calm [i.e., relaxed], then apply another cautery to that place again as you did originally.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If hair is found below, then it should be cauterized immediately until it reaches its proper place; and it will equal to not itch the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 When cauterizing with a burning medicine of the same kind.
Caput XVIII.	 The eighteenth head
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is that the sick person may cease hair until they are prolonged and equal to each other.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 From an inscription on a piece of linen, "I made myself like the wings of a bird.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Afterwards he took soap in his knowledge, and from the water not taken once or any other load of a penny weight, until then he takes good grace with it, so that it would be avoided.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Afterwards from the hand of a cloth as you made the shape of wings like bird feathers and puts it on the eye socket one or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under his eye drink, the albumen, yes; and sick head is in your neck.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And puts your finger pointing above medicine, and makes it jump higher.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you might say to him the number of times sense was sick and biting medical treatment: because his bite as fire had hit.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 When therefore he persisted this which itself has bitten off, then dismiss the medicine and move her with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 And when you stop biting, then remove the medicine, and wipe the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then consider if you want to rub the eyelid with a stroke like fire or a cut: and then it is good; but if not, then again above from medicine on the place where did not medicine print, and does not tarnish, until it becomes equal operation your hand, and contraction of the eye.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Afterwards puts with butter over him, until eradicate skin burns.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards cure it with a treatment of honey or another, until it is cured.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And you must be there at the end of an operation to keep your last hold of a place that nothing from medicine does not fall into his eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 "If the eyelid is swollen after a day and scratches something into the eye from its hairs, then apply medicine to that place where the swelling originates from the eyelid itself just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 After this care for him until he recovers.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a man's death.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 You know that men's eyes differ in size and proportion.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, given this consideration by you - and not to be concealed the way of rectitude for him who pursues this art with diligence.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 Of burning a fistula of tears
Caput XIX.	 Head 19th
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat a fistula as we described in divisions of tears and do not make your care complete - then when cauterizing it is required that you do so according to this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Support him until he places his head on your arm and holds it with his own head resting between your hands so that it does not move or cause any disturbance by the head itself.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 After placing a small glass on his eye, or over his eyelid with saliva - then burn the cautery whose shape is this one.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Hold it tightly, as if the shape of a pen's quill bound by one end and held tight with both ends - just like how the cautery fits in: and if you push it forward until the other edge is reached and if you hold it tightly from above then do so.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concauum is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 After expressing the fistula if it is open and take out what you have taken - then put him back in immediately if not opened; take from his hand and put her there.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place over it the cautery that is heated on fire.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold with your hand tightly near the cautery on his eye to prevent it from being pulled out or agitated by him - and place over that the cautery in a groove of the eyelid and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you perform an operation from your own cautery until it reaches a good result
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not, then make another cautery at once or after some time, depending on the extent of the injury; and discard this tool in three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a bandage soaked with butter, and treat him with oil until he is cured.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If after 40 days he does not get better, then apply a hot corrosive medicine to him until the disease is cured; and repeat this application as many times as needed within its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 Another method of cautery was mentioned by some people.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Cauterize the place where the fistula is found; and then apply a subtle tool called a Canna subtilis, which has this form.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And when you have found this in him and measured out a drachma of the liquefied lead, hold your hand with the good Canna, so that he does not lose his strength and should not be moved from any direction, lest it flow down to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And you must apply the injured man's lead with either egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 Lead is cauterized to the place of the fistula and is cured by a marvelous treatment.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed as we have described from the cautery and care, it is beneficial (good).
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then you must administer a nasal tube to the fistula and narrow it down towards its own course as much as possible at that place itself.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 By this method of cautery for the veins (Labi).
Caput XX.	 The 20th chapter.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 There are many tears in the veins of the lips which are called Pila, and especially in the mouths of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 If you have many tears to cure; as we described it by the burning of small bits of lead and without care for the treatment, then burn the narrow tool with fire in this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 His skill is measured as how much he can subdue her (the patient)
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then he shall apply a flame to the wounds so that it may cauterize them and prevent any further bleeding from deep wounds.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 And then he will treat him with the cautery until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 By means of the cautery applied to the fistula of the nose.
Caput XXI.	 Head 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When the abscess is in the root of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of teeth - then he makes pus and it runs; subsequently it hardens, it flows, it forms a fistula; then the same cure is applied, but not put into her treatment, then it is necessary to apply fire to the fistula according to the amount that fits within the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then he shall apply the flame to a fistula of the nostrils and hold your hand until it cauterizes deeply into him; afterwards you do this same thing once or twice more often.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 And then he cures him after that as we have said in the treatment until it is cured completely.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore his health improves and heals, this will be a good thing.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to remove the corrupted place and cure his mouth according to what did not occur at the top of his head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 By means of the cautery applied to the gums, and the teeth are softened up
Caput XXII.	 Head 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gums are softened due to moisture and teeth are moved by them, and cure her with medicines, do not put it - then he puts his head on your shoulder.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then the flame is applied to cauterize it; which shape cannot follow these - so that you put a bandage on top of the tooth and then apply fire in it until he feels the heat already from the teeth: hold your hand firmly while doing this.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And afterwards you repeat cautery a number of times according to what is being done with them.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 "Then [the sick person] puts his mouth under a warm stream of salty water and holds it for one hour; then spits out the same.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 The hardness of the throat [is] softened by means of the application of a warm stream of salty water and stretching [of the tongue], and thus moisture is restored to that which has been corrupted through dryness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 "The manner for cauterizing teeth.
Caput XXIII.	 The 23rd part.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the pain [in teeth] is due to coldness or there is a chill present; when they are numb and not restored by treatment with medicines, then use a Cautery in this way - either as a Cautery with butter or a Cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The Cautery [is used] when it is employed together with butter - as you gently place the butter upon its surface and press it down into the ear canal or the nose.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take hold of it [the Cautery] and apply pressure to both sides.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then plunge the Cautery into butter and press it onto a painful tooth; hold it there until the pain subsides; then repeatedly apply pressure to gradually extinguish the fire in the teeth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 "And if you wish - plunge the Cautery into a cold butter or onto a painful tooth; and then press it down with hot iron until the fire is extinguished in the deepest part of the teeth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The Cautery [is used] when it is employed together with fire - either to the air passage or onto a metal object such as a piece of iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And there should be some bodily substance within it so that it cannot extinguish the heat [of fire] towards your mouth when you are ill.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply the Cautery to it [the fire] and place it onto that tooth; hold your hand while you do this until the Cautery is extinguished.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this several times as necessary - either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 "And apply pressure to it [the Cautery] as you gently place the warm butter upon its surface and hold it for one hour; then spit out the same.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the cauterizing instrument
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whatever extremity you have at your disposal, and this is the form of a needle
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 To cauterize through a straw.
Caput XXIIII.	 Head (24).
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When the straw is full of phlegm and surrounded by cold fluids that do not facilitate digestion through the mechanical means with which they are supplied, you light the cautery, whose form this is.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open extremities to allow smoke from one to pass through to the cautery by another, and setting it on fire above the other immediately until a hole is burned all the way through, or if you need to go further into that hole, then after the second time when you light it up again.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the hole has become small, then set another smaller needle in the hole to cauterize further.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then remove it after three days and put fat over it until what was burned away by the fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then cure him with oil of cloves to heal the needle's shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 To cauterize through a straw and constriction.
Caput XXV.	 Head (25).
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When fluids come over the lungs' straw and especially when that is accompanied by cold complexion, it should be encouraged to first help with medical solutions.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize him into a knot at the base of his throat on both sides, and after that do not continue with the cautery, unless something else is needed.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize him into a knot with the cautery above his knee joints, and after that put another smaller one on for later use.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then cure him with it until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 To cauterize through the lungs and also.
Caput XXVI.	 Head (26).

When cough and lung stiffness are caused by cold dampness and weakness does not have fever or phthisis (scrofula) and ancient cough; at that time cautery should be applied with two skewers above the navel in depressed positions, gently
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And another one in between the breasts; and set a second catheter according to its shape that precedes it.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 If your cautery is done with a needle called Point whose shape proceeds from the pain of the ear; and there are thirty points ranging up to nearly as many others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then you should take care of him when it precedes, until he is cured
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And then a catheter with three rams in this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Because the application of cautery is done when you do it with one tria catheters.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 The method for cautery in the Titillation and dislocation of the arm.
Caput XXVII.	 The twenty-seventh chapter.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the arm causes dislocation by dampness and does not fit into place at the time of its own discharge until it becomes accustomed to its customarily correct position; then after a little movement which happened just as we have testified this is necessary that you decrease the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then he will be supported over his back, or over both shoulders
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 And then use the left hand's finger to touch gently the inner Titillation towards the top; and if dislocation happens there.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 And then a catheter with two rams is made.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Whose shape this is.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then the catheter should be applied until it penetrates to another side of the ribs and does not change form with four catheters.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes when the application of cautery is done with three catheters whose shape proceeds; then six catheters are necessary; and the rams should be set according to the subtlety of the thrusting.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 "This is a three-pronged lancet used for cautery.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 "And sometimes it is added over this way one, which are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 "Then you put a sponge soaked in salt above the cautery to hold onto it securely.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 "And then gently remove the affected part of tranquility so that it doesn't move in time and when it is ready to be comfortable.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 "If the dislocation is on higher up, that is rare and then cauterize it with a large clamp over the arm or by puncturing many cauteries.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 "About cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 "Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 "When there are cold and moist conditions in the stomach until it is extracted with its own skin and many catapults are added to him and they apply various methods of cauterization, but do not confer: Then he should be stretched out on his back and extend his limbs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 "And then he cautorizes with three cauteries and below the lower part of the shoulder is done with one clamp and under two laterals of one clamp until the figure of triangular cauteries are formed.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 "And they lengthen between them so that they do not connect when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 "The depth of the cauterization is related to the size of three third ones in terms of surface.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 "And the shape of the cauteries should be according to this figure without adding: And if you cautorize with a large clamp in the middle of the stomach according to this figure: and there is a cauterization that fits into one according to the circle's shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 "The stomach is cautorized with a clamp that holds onto it from this clamp and there are signs above the stomach marked point by quantity as you do with encaustic: Then he cautorizes him with punctures then cure him with a treatment until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On cold objects
Caput XXIX.	 In the 29th book
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When frostbite, severe pain is caused by it and moisture or a big swelling, until the excess flow of natural skin, and then treatment of sick people, as we said earlier, should not be profice in this: you need to bring the patient up on their own chest with three signs cauterization at once, and this amount same below the hypodermis where he touched the human figure. And space is between all cautery according to the size of the fingers: and a cautery according to the length of the right side of the body: do not compress your hand too much with excessive cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And there is a quantity that comes from the hardness of the skin, and not an increase in amount; and should be standing still on their own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing still, then let him fall to the ground, who has extended his limbs and hands himself.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And to you it's possible that you cauterize this cautery with a cauterizer when you are skilled and have prudence in your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And protect yourself that you do not go to cauterization last and harden the whole body, so that it is hardened throughout the body, but also to prevent from the intestines: because skin there is soft, therefore beware of this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 On the cautery of the Epar's ears
Caput XXX.	 In the 30th book
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When the exit wound occurs and you know that this is on the ear of Epar or inside his tunic, then if it's in the skin of Epar, there was pain for the sick person, and hardness without heat: and if it's inside the tunic of Epar with pain from the heat of others. And you already realize because the treatment has become exhausted by the doctors to him.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 "Let him lie down upon his own bed.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 After that, apply the heated cautery with encaustic plaster to the figure and after that burn away what has been coagulated (or coagulated flesh).
Et haec est forma eius.	 That is his form or shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 Then he applies the cautery once with him until his whole skin is burned away and then cleans himself thoroughly from the wounds until all of his senses are recovered; after that, care for him in order to recover.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 It is not necessary to apply the cautery form so that it may be done, unless his study in the art of medicine has been prolonged; and with whom hands have accompanied these illnesses for some time now; then he dares to perform this kind of operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 Better it would be that I remove her from there (i.e., the sick person's bedside).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Cautery of the pleurectomy.
Caput XXXI.	 Head number 11.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients applied the cautery with the roots of the Aristolochia to the pleurectomy cold as follows:
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is that you take the root of the Aristolochia as a longer one, which comes from there and sits like the size of your fingers.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 After that immerse her in oil; then ignite or burn her with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then he applies the cautery once into him where there is a connection between the head and neck, with two cauteries to a lesser extent guided by guides under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two more cauteries into him where there is a connection between the fifth and sixth ribs to the back; and another one into the middle of the chest; and another one above the abdomen.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And three more cauteries to the back; one into him where there is between two spoons; and two more with both of the lateral ribs, below a cautery which is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 It's not necessary to squeeze your hand with the cautery, let it be displayed on the skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 "Some of the surgeons," they said, "are like those who are cauterized with a hot iron and burned; inside them [the patient] is introduced by fire until it reaches its proper destination within the back so that it may be discharged when needed, unless there's an obstruction: just as we described in the previous chapter for Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 "But with this incision and cautery there is fear, either the patient may die quickly or a fistula occurs at that place where no remedy is.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 How to perform splenasection
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you cure the spleen by splenasection, as we described in our previous chapter regarding the treatment of jaundice, and if your care does not help, then the cautery is used according to three ways [described below].
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of the three methods is as follows: Cauterize in a manner that cuts transversely across the spleen's length according to the shape of the cautery [Epatis].
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And for each cautery there is quantity of fingerbreadths, either many or few.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method [of cautery] that we described regarding Epatis's cautery was equal to both methods and one more.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; let the patient exhale into their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is as follows: When holding the cautery with two fingers according to our description in the chapter on dislocations [of the arm], let it be released when the left cubit falls down, and you release it according to the width of the body so that they fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 After that you should hold two ignited fingers until they penetrate the other [hand]. Afterwards take it out of there; thus four cauteries are done.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if another person holds a third finger along with you, then cautery is performed according to three methods.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 After releasing it after many days, the cure is more effective than what preceded it from care.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Cautery is performed with the aid of a syringe/needle and fire.
Caput XXXIII.	 Head (of a person).
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery does not fail when applied properly
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you cure the Hydropicum using our prescribed methods and do not administer error correction, then it is necessary to apply cautery on four areas around the navel, one above the stomach, another above the buttocks, a third over the wound, two behind the back between the spine points, one directly at the chest, and another directly at the belly. And let the depth of the cautery be proportionate to the sharpness of the pain
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 After the cautery is applied, it will release a quantity of pus over an extended period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And after the application, you should add two intentions to it. It will heal with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 With the form used for applying a cautery to the belly, it should be sharp like that one. And with the form used for the back, it should be broad as that one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Cautery is performed on the feet and hands.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Head (of a person), feet (of a person), hands
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When you apply the Hydropic (a preparation to remove excess skin or fat), and replenish with a citrus water, then apply cautery over the back of the feet between the ear and the anus. And take your hand holding the cautery and do not twist it. Then take your other hand and don't touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The water will soften and the cautery should be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 After that, apply two cauteries on each of the limbs and set it with a sharp point to cautery. And make the cautery according to the length of the thigh; one below the knee, another below, surrounding around the middle of the thigh. And make two cauteries over all the joints. After releasing the cautery without correction for a long time, let some water be released from it. Then cure it with what we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Cauterizing solution of the Ventricle
Caput XXXV.	 The 35th head
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution from the stomach is cooled by ice or moisture, until the stomach's strength and digestion weaken, which are in the stomach and intestines; then, cure this with care using appropriate methods, but not heal: when you encounter a patient whose body has become inflamed due to too much cautery, at that time cauterize it with a large cautery over his own stomach. In the same way as before for the stomach, use four cauteries around the umbilicus (umbilicus), and two cauteries; or cautery over the diaphragm above the ribs if there are two of them
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you encounter excessive moisture and the patient is more tolerant of the illness at that time, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the pecten (pharyngeal tonsil) as well as all other areas; and in addition add two smaller cauteries above the stomach near its great one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 It is a beneficial treatment, whose outcome cannot go wrong.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Cauterizing hemorrhoids
Caput XXXVI.	 The 36th head
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When hemorrhoids are present in the anus and many of them or just one, and they come from excessive humor, coldness, or moisture corruption; then cure this with it as we said before for the uterus, but do not give a benefit to treatment: at that time cauterize three cauteries above the inferior spine of the back below slightly curved triangles, and a cautery under the umbilicus (umbilicus) almost by two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If you think his stomach is frozen and he can't digest food or face turns sour, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach as before; and a cautery above the epiglottis (glottis) of his throat, another above the spleen of his abdomen, using the same method: give an open cure after a while to let it heal until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 After excision of wounds
Caput XXXVII.	 [This chapter is missing in the text]
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you excisions wounds, then ignite the cautery that has been applied with a flame.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the ignited cautery into the cut wound; and finally your hand, until it is removed from the opening of the vein by which blood flows out: this should be done once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are multiple wounds, then cautery each one separately with the same instrument as we used before.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then cure them by applying the ointment until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cautery him with a large cautery over the bandage, then it will be even more of an extreme.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 How to cauterize the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 This chapter is missing in the text.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When you do not succeed to perform the incision and operation on its own place, then it will be cautery with cautery to heal.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 With this happened to a fistula, he was healed and the discharge from that occurred and corrupted moisture.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is right that one should try gently with tweezers to extract it.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then determine the depth of his fistula by gently pulling on it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then ignite the cautery that is similar to a flame.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce you into the ignited fistula and determine how deeply it was pulled by tweezers.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 Then apply additional cautery until all the corrupted bodies are healed once or twice or three times depending on how deeply you pulled them out by tweezers.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And protect you from the flame of a fire, if it is there or on another body part, until the fistula is directed to the corresponding body cavity: either to the body's surface, or to the intestines' body, then protect you at those locations all around.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do this unless the fistula is in a fatty location and you try to penetrate it.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Until the place is healed
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If a seal was placed on the location and the materials are removed from it, then in time there is no need to worry as by that time he has already healed completely
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If the materials are not removed from it then you know that he is attempting to get through it or he has a perforated mouth and/or has swallowed something which may come out of his throat. In either case, the memory of these events should be noted at its own location.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Of cauterizing Renes
Caput XXXIX.	 Head number 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When he has suffered from frostbite or a great cold and/or had a severe shivering fit which makes him lose consciousness, it is necessary that he be cauterized over the snow-covered Renes in front of them all with an eye dropper to put on every single Renes who had received treatment. The memory of these events should then be noted at their own location.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And we may cauterize him again once within the same location as his first.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three lines?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore more were needed at the end of the treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Of cauterizing Vesicam
Caput XL.	 Head number 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When he has become weak from Vesica and the cold has caused a softening of urine due to its moisture and frigidity, unless his strength is retained until urination starts, then we must cauterize him in the lower part of his back towards Vesica where the pectine hairs begin. And also in front of both sides of his body with an eye dropper: this way he may be treated on one side or two sides depending on how many doctors are available to do it and what treatment has been applied before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Of cauterizing Matricem.
Caput XLI.	 Head number 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When he is struck with cold and moisture from Matrice where impregnation was prohibited and menstruation occurred to him, unless the cause of this condition had already been established when they arrived in front of each other (i.e., they were not brought there on purpose), then it is necessary that three cauterizers be used around his belly button as we mentioned before for Vesica's cautery, but also on the inferior back or by two cauters depending on how many doctors are available and what treatment had been applied before. The memory of this event should be noted at its own location.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 Dislocation of the Anchis
Caput XLII.	 The twelfth cranial nerve has been dislocated.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 If the mucosa becomes humid and causes the Anchises to be drawn out of place, causing his death at that location; its sign is that it extends from one side to another when brought together with a finger; upon dislocation, this area becomes swollen.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is recommended to cauterize the sick person above the Anchises' dislocation with a cautery similar in shape; after you have marked him with encaustic paint as described earlier: until he falls into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 The cautery whose form precedes that of stomach cautery
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If that cautery is not present at the time you are using it, then cauterize him with three cauteries as described earlier; after that cauterize him again with a large cautery: and let there be depth in proportion to the amount of skin being burned throughout the whole body.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 After this treatment he will recover (be cured).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Dislocation of the twelfth cranial nerve causes sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 The thirteenth cranial nerve has been dislocated.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When a pain arises from the Anchises' dislocation and causes chills or humidity; and when you treat him as we described in the previous division but do not apply curative treatment either, let that happen: then it is recommended to cure the sick person with bitter pills of the fetus, or with artificial ones, similar
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 After this, cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 The method of cautery is as follows; either by using the cautery with medicines applied to it or by using fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cautery by fire is done in many ways
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One way is to cauterize above the Anchises' dislocation using three triangular shaped cauteries with this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make sure that the depth of burn is good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 The space between all the cauteries should equal to the quantity of flesh burned on each hand, and there be one big cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 When a cautery is applied over the top of the arrowhead
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 There are four types of cauteries
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 When using a circular cautery, the shape should be such that it encircles and holds the arrowhead firmly.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 It is to cut through all of the skin completely
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is a method for cautery used on sciatica when the pain touches the arrowhead itself and does not reach to the hips or thighs.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If the pain reaches to the hips and thighs, then you apply two cauteries simultaneously on each hip at the location where the pain occurs until it subsides, and your cautery is placed on top of four fingers touching a part of it (so as to avoid any damage), making sure that the cautery is in place.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 The depth of the cautery should be determined by the depth of the skin incision.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the pain reaches towards the toes, then apply a cautery at that location with one or two or three or four or more, as it may be necessary to do so.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If the pain is below the knee and above the foot, then apply a cautery at that location with one of those placed on top of it.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 Always remember to prevent the cautery from causing harm or cutting through major blood vessels and arteries while aiming for what lies above it on a patient with pain, either in order to stop the bleeding or to contract their muscles.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I also heard that someone was burned to death after cauterizing above the foot and causing it to inflate with blood until a tumor formed on their leg, then perforating everything completely and corrupting all of their weight; from there came heart failure and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in both parts simultaneously, apply a cautery to each as per this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Some wise people said that there was a method for cautering an arrowhead.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 A small hole is made with a tool whose diameter equals the size of your little finger. And it must be inserted into its own orifice according to the length of the third digit from each hand, either as large or smaller than that; and in this hole you should insert a third stick similar to the first two.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And it is the space between all sticks measured by the length of each finger's nails; and the sticks should be opened at both ends; and their height will be like a single stick, or two sticks; and you should bind them securely with an iron tool to those sticks.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is burned in fire until it becomes red and emits flashes; then it should be placed over a sick person gently supported on the healthy limb.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, you will burn him with three round irons simultaneously one at a time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then remove it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards, you apply the plaster with butter; and then after opening the wound, bathe in water several times.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he recovers
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 To Albucasis (the author), a caution regarding the sons of Cautes; for he is very useful, because of his appearance, and therefore many are expected by him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 However it should be noted that from good irons to him who suffered; he will come with him the place of his suffering.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 Cauterium however with the help of medicines is used when you make two sticks perforated through an armlet; and this stick descends from the door of his heart either by air or iron according to their height, whose height will be like a single stick, or two sticks.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And it is the space between both quantities of fingers' breadth; and they are opened below and above; and what holds them to each other according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then you place it over a sick person gently supported on the healthy limb.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand tightly over the plaster of the sick person very much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 When heated with a hot iron, and held for a time of the hour, it is tolerated by the afflicted one both against his own wound as well as that which has inflicted him; thus he himself inflicts a burning wound on himself like fire until the treatment stops
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 With your hand holding the instrument and cleanse it with hot water all over until it is completely clean; then let it rest for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And put butter over it until the blackness is removed; then let it rest for a while and take out some of its pus
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 This indeed marks the final stage in the illness.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 And treat it with ointments until it is cured.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the shoulder or arm, have him place it where you retained water from the previous treatment with equal force.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 This is how heated water should be used; and I have already written about that in my book on medical treatments
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take the alkali and calcis separately one part each; place them in new vessels whose lower parts are perforated through a small hole by equal quantity to which you will feed with your hand's radius; place another vessel below it containing hot water, and squeeze out of both of them using your hands until you have compressed as much as possible. Then let go of the vessels after you have squeezed their contents good enough, so that the sharp water may descend into the lower part of the vessels.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Finally, pour all the water onto another vessel and squeeze it over the other alkali; and repeat until you can continue no more.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 This one will be of great assistance to the physician during many operations and in cauterizing the remains of members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it is effective for treating wounds with fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And from the medical substances there are others, to be used for cauterizing a large area of flesh as well as this one; and they also include Melanconium and Calcarea with soap in equal portions.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 "Galen reported that he had cured certain diseases of the bones and nerves through which he was a physician.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 "Galen reported that he had not been able to treat any other disease, but was cured by the waters of a particular place and became healthy thereafter.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 "It is necessary to administer the water of a certain place for healing, and if it does not succeed from the physician, then the patient should be given dry food until he has become accustomed to eating: and after becoming accustomed, he should be put on a table at which there was pain in his feet or thighs. Then bind him up with thongs, so that no matter how long or short they are, for three hours.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 "After that he brought the patient into the water of a certain place.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 "Since his body was exhausted after entering the water, he carried him to a bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 "The pain subsided and he became healthy.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 "And you know that it is not necessary to use someone else's remedies until after the body has been cleansed of them.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 "Dioscorides reported that when he cautorized a sheep for its sciatica, it was cured in the same way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 "The patient should be given a sheepskin, and drink old oil; and put on a deep place between the thumb and toe, between the fingers and toes.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 "Then he should take a dry sheepskin and burn it in fire until it is consumed.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 "Then put him back on the sheep skin, and let him go down until he is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 "And repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 "Do not stop doing this until the pain goes away and he is at rest on the table.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 "This method of cautery is called the Vaccine Cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 "Of Cauterizing for Pain Relief by Dorsie.
Caput XLIIII.	 Fourteen
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 If the pain arises from a blow to the back of the head or as a result of a fall, or through an incision, evacuation of excess moisture is performed for these cases just like others and with the same method: by applying a cold wet compress, but not a burn-producing one; if it doesn't work, then only this type of bandage will do.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 After evacuating the baby's back with its own umbilical cord and for these cases as well, let them lie on their backs until the pain subsides, making sure to apply wax in all lines of the treatment every 5 cauteries or more frequently depending on how much excess moisture was removed from the nurse; and make sure to cauterize it using cautery points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if so, cauterize with two or four cauteries and with the middle cautery as a second method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 The method of cauterization for cases involving the back of the head
Caput XLV.	 Fifteen
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 Many a time this headache is inflicted on infants by blows or falls.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of the injury is on their heads and consists of a cut that happened near the fall or blow, and also an unusual movement towards the back: and in these cases the back of the head gets stiff and numb from the rest of them.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 After that happens to you, do this: Cauterize him with a circle cautery as the second method.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And place the cautery evenly over all parts of the spine; and if you are cauterizing through a bandage around the back of the head, do it with two or three points close together; and there should be points nearby to use as needed.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then give him rest until he is cured as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And do not apply the cautery to a headache, which occurs through spasms of the nervous system.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 The method for cauterization in gout and joint pain.
Caput XLVI.	 Forty-six
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pain from compression by cold and dampness affects any part of the body, then when the pain occurs in the feet due to custom among physicians, they are called Podagrom properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Thus cure for podagra caused by cold and dampness with appropriate treatment methods, and the pains are not alleviated, it will be cured by cautery (burning).
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that cautery should be done after evacuation of the affected part of the foot, with many applications and a burning oil (oleum).
Cuius haec est forma.	 What is this shape?
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if there are blisters over the face of the feet, then you apply cautery to those blisters.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain goes up to the knees or is accompanied by wounds and many times occurs, then you burn him over all four joints with three or four applications of the same cautery (clavius).
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If it's necessary for you to have more than one application of this cautery, then burn him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And don't cover your hand with the cautery, just make a small incision in the skin to release pressure from it.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pain reaches up to the buttocks and back as well, then apply what we said about cautery on his head.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If there are pain only in the hands up to here (the wrist), then make incisions into blisters with a burning thread as they would heal by two lines.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If there is relief from pain only in the fingers, then make incisions into them above all the joints of the hand and above the palm of the hand as well.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If there are pain after a day up to the elbows or shoulders, then burn him over all parts.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And don't make use of a foolish remedy from doing things badly by doctors who know little about medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If there is good regimen and it will release the phlegm, God's help with that cautery will make him well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Cauterizing wounds
Caput XLVII.	 72nd head
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a tear occurs to the anus and descends into the intestine or perineum, it is approaching; then one should immediately stop eating on that day
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And if he passes feces through his own opening.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then you should hold him by the back of his neck and encourage to bring it out until he has passed stool or urine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then you should reduce him by your fingers and bind his upper lip to the tear with a hot iron; thus he will be prevented from moving towards the top of the face, unless it is possible that urine or stool passes out before this happens.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then you should burn a small piece of iron and tie it to his upper lip; thus he will not be able to move towards the top of the face until he has passed urine or stool.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine by your fingers, or bring the anus closer to your body
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then place one of your hands on his head so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already placed another under the anus, and a third above it to hold its position.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place a small piece of iron over his upper lip with your hand holding tight the iron; so that he will not be able to move towards the top of the face until he has passed urine or stool.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him there so that his mouth does not open up further; unless you have succeeded with the iron to close its mouth at first until the anus comes out.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe when he passes stool after your cauterizing; so that you do not burn him and his death is certain or great harm happens.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that if you cannot succeed with the iron to close its mouth after the cauterization operation has been performed, then your procedure will not work.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 The piece of iron used for infants should be very small according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 After that, with the remaining ointments, so as to cure it.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 Forty days and nights he lies motionless on his back until the blister heals
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 He should be fed with measured portions of his own weight for a period of time, in order to prevent the waste from passing through him and emptying into the bowl or bladder.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then after forty days, when he is strong enough to stand up again, bind him securely with ligatures and let him rest for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And he will regain his strength through rest, good food, drink, and light exercise.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 When the regimen is followed as prescribed, then complete healing will occur.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I say that the treatment for Rupturae should include incisions into his caput (head).
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 If Rupturae occur in the rest of his body and are about to begin, then they should not be added on, at that point cauterize the Ruptures with a heated iron or other cautery device according to their quantity: so that it occurs as if from before, just third.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 And then you should continue his treatment as we have said, without adding any more to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 Some people say that the Ruptures should be cauterized with a triangular cautery device according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After the Ruptures are marked with encaustic wax and a line is drawn along their width across the top of the Ruptures to the upper side, and another line down from there.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand on it as you would hold something hot
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 However, the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 In order to cauterize when there is a chance of pain or shock, either from injury or concussion
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 If Rupturae occur from injury or shock and the pain persists for a long time without any treatment: then it is necessary to cauterize them with Punctum Cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the Cautery for all parts of his body should be according to their size and strength, and any disability or loss of power he has experienced, and also according to pain that results from them.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 "If healing is done through first cutting, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 "Otherwise, apply a cautery over this.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because of the custom among them is that they are exchanged from one member to another as needed for what suits him best.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore it is necessary that with cautery those who are injured may be healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 The method of cauterization from leprosy
Caput XLIX.	 Head, forty-nine
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes healed with the greatest application of cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 Especially for species of Leprosy which are caused by the decomposition of phlegm and melancholy. Therefore, when you consider that specific one with cautery.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If Leprosy is the cause and you treated it with that one, as we said in division. But if it did not descend or remained unchanged, do this: Cauterize his head five times: first on the top of the head near the eyebrows; second below him towards the forehead by the end of hair; third above both ears; fourth behind both knees and fifth behind his neck by the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And lastly with the hand on his mouth near it, until he prints a foam in its mouth and they fall out of him; that is to free the expiration of heavy vapors from him; and cauterize also over his spleen as much as has been previously done.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 And if the Leprosy is already spread over him and appears visibly; then do this with these cauteries as we said for the head. But add also on the nose, two above both cheeks, two above both shoulders, six above the back of the body, one large by the great tail, one above it in order to relieve the pain from his arm.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 In your throat are some small bones beneath the chinbone (collarbone), and you should not swallow them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 When a cautery is applied to the upper part of the throat or nose, another one to the stomach (chest), and yet another one at the epiglottis.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 You should know that the further a cautery is applied, the greater the pain it will cause and the quicker you will die.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 You should know that if a person is not injured by the pain of the cautery as when they are burned, then their body has already been stunned (stunned or paralyzed).
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that a cautery be applied in proportion to its magnitude and extent of the members (joints) it joins together, according to which it precedes by the species of the tools used for such purpose.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 After that, treat with flour and pitch the cautery until it is cured (healed).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 In order to cauterize effectively.
Caput L.	 The end of this excerpt.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a member is stunned by something, it should be treated with medicines and oil and glue until it recovers or is cured (healed), but if the member cannot recover from its stunned condition, then cauterize it to revive it using a larger cautery as needed based on the size of the affected member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Your cautery should be applied with greater force and at a faster rate than usual, if you want to avoid burns or other injuries from its application.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 After that, treat it with oil until it is cured (healed).
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Sometimes when a cautery is applied to stun or stun the hand and feet by hitting them with something hard on exiting from behind, so that they may recover from their stunned condition (paralyzed).
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 However it is not recommended for a person who does not know about the anatomy of the members and how to exit from behind (escape), because they may not be able to escape or recover their stunned condition when hit by something hard on exiting from behind, causing them more harm than good.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 In order to effectively cauterize the nose and its environs (the nose area).
Caput LI.	 The end of this excerpt.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When the veins become inflamed and nothing can be done by medicine alone, then cautery shall be applied deeply into that inflamed vein with a cautery instrument as much as necessary to cover up its surface until it is removed or the color of it changes
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 After cautery is applied to the inflamed vein with a cautery instrument, it should be treated with flour and herbs or lentis (oranges) and rose oil, and on the leaves of astringent herbs like hyacinths and columbines. It can also be treated with the blood of pigeon or hyacinthine flowers. All these things mixed together shall they apply over the skin until it is cured
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 The procedure for cautery in cancer
Caput LII.	 Chapter Two
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is emerging and one should hold it back from spreading further by cautery.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The doctors said that the cautery should be done last of all things.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 I don't understand this, because I am afraid it will cause more harm than good and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is better to do the cautery by encircling it with a circle as we previously said or using multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 The procedure for cautery on bruises
Caput LIII.	 Chapter Thirty Three
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has bruises and they become mature or because of an excess of fluid causing swelling, or due to old age becoming weaker as their blood count decreases, or time, one should press on the bruise with several cauteries until it is mature.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 It will finish maturing by itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If one perforates the bruise with the cautery then they should use a cautery iron which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And deposit it in the middle of the bruises until it is penetrated through to make sure that the cautery iron reaches all of them and so it can be used when one falls ill as a cure for clear urine.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 However, please note that this is a medieval Latin translation and the meaning might not be identical with standard modern Latin translations in terms of grammar or terminology used
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Cauterize by means of a corrosive instrument
Caput LIIII.	 The head.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is not limited to members that are immersed; it also affects the one being charred, as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you want to stop the one being charred by corrosion, then apply a large amount of charcoal and a small amount of pitch, in the place where he is present, so that it may meet his location
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Once you have applied charcoal and pitch to all parts of him until the corrosion stops completely, nothing else should remain from it except for a slight residue.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 After three days, put on top of the areas that have been treated with charcoal and pitch a mixture of sulfur and oil, until all the char is gone, and every corrosion.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Cure him using ointments made from various ingredients.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If you want to cure a person who has become healthy after three days when there is no more corruption, it's good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not, then apply the charcoal and pitch to what remains from the places that were corrupted once again.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 The one being charred is treated sometimes with an acute medicine
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 This happens because of the location of the charring.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, the charring with fire is either excessive or of poor quality; and I have already said that the cure for it involves both a mixture of charcoal and an acute medicine applied to where he is present. Therefore take this remedy when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Cauterize by means of blisters and warts
Caput LV.	 The head.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 There was a large amount of filth on the lower parts of his feet; it is heavy and filtered, which caused the foot to sweat.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cure for charring involves two methods: the one with fire and the other with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 When the cure is made with fire, it burns a certain amount of charcoal evenly from all sides; and its edge should be very thin.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 In the meantime place it over a hot stone
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 In the meantime, take hold of it with forceps and apply it to the wound until bleeding stops; then let it remain in place for three days, after which you may remove it if no more blood flows out.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 In the meantime smear it with honey and bind it tightly; then let it stay on for one night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be removed from its roots
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime anoint and care for it with a healing ointment to keep it in good condition until healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If it fails to heal and many wounds happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then administer it over hot stones with forceps or a heated iron or pen of a skilled artist; then place it over the stone until healed.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 In the meantime use a small amount of it and tie your hand around it; then apply pressure with both hands to make the needle pierce into its root deeply, while also applying hot water on top of that same needle until the bleeding stops; expect the healing within one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then remove it because the stone will be removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to them all one after another until you reach everyone who has come from these wounds on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 After removing it, care for them with ointment that generates flesh as a remedy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 The method of bleeding control in Tremor
Caput LVI.	 Head XVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 If someone with Tremor from cold or fever comes to you, then it is necessary for you to apply four forceps on the forehead and sides of the head; five over the shoulders and back of the chest; across all the bones in the body; within his breastbone itself, while also above his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 Tremor will cease with ointment application and the freshness of cold waters cures its own kind of coldness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Cautery
Caput LVII.	 The 72nd Cautery
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 When the Albathiri's pus is expelled from the body and becomes infected with corrupted matter, it forms blisters that are gross and corrupt.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, at the beginning it is advisable to cauterize each blister with a fine needle and brimstone, whose extremity is set on fire by flame
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or using the root of the tall Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lancet made of lead.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And when we have cautorized them initially and the discharge begins as follows, it does not increase; but the excess is removed by this method and they are healed.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, after evacuation with phlebotomy (bleeding).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Cautery through the veins from the arteries to the ulcers.
Caput LVIII.	 The 73rd Cautery
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many veins were cut off by the flow of blood from an artery that was cut near a wound; they either went outside or into the member itself, and so on; it is difficult to remove them.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when you encounter such a situation and are about to remove it from the artery's opening with your hand; place your thumb over it as an indicator, then pull him (the clot) out very forcefully until his blood is completely absorbed beneath your thumb, and do not let anything escape from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then you apply a cautery of oil to burn away any remaining blood; and after that, blow out the flames until they are extinguished.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Afterwards take one of them, or many small ones, as is convenient and the place where the artery was cut; and you lay it on top of that same part immediately after removing your thumb from there; and hold it until all the blood has been removed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the clot is removed with your finger out of the artery opening and you extinguish the cautery at that time, then take another one immediately afterwards; from those which have been heated up by fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 "Do not stop doing that thing with one hand and then another, until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 "And do not mix a poisonous herb when it's there, or put on another illness after weakness.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 "And you know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to sever him; especially because one of the arteries is large and unless with four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 "But as I said earlier.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 "Or when it's not extracted,
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 "Then when he is extracted, his extremities are bound and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 "Or tied with a strong thread,
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 "And placed on him medicines of the owner who can sever the blood and are tied up with a good constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 "Whoever administers the severance of him with a thread and ties up tight, or puts on it knots of things to be mixed together, or similar ones, does not inflict any injury except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 "If anyone puts this on him and there's no doctor nearby, nor medicine; then starts with the position of his index finger above the hole in one ear just as we showed it, and constricts its artery until he is completely blocked off by blood to the upper part of the nostrils, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 "And his finger is not removed at all with a cold water bath every time; until the blood freezes and becomes hard and severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 "Meanwhile he considers what comes from cautery or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	 "The first part is finished.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 "Book Two of the Surgery Book by Albucasis.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 "On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in ears, etc., and others like them.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 "In the first chapter we have mentioned all kinds of accidents that people get burned or hurt by fire and medicine when mixing it with them.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 I place the tools from the elbow to the foot
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And then, having reached that chapter, I proceed thus: that he who is seeking for what has been sought by him may be relieved.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 Before starting this chapter, it is necessary for you to know that the thing described here is found in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of this, it is necessary that there be greater caution here since the operation described here has many dangers such as cuts with blood, cutting through the spine when opening an exit wound or a leg, cutting above the thighbone and so on: from all these things tremor, fear and death come.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 I remind you so that nothing bad may happen to you since sometimes it happens to those who are skilled at this art because of the weaknesses and failings of people.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 It is because of this that someone becomes angry with his own pain and death comes to him: for it was brought on by his weakness and length, bringing him torment from his own pain and lengthiness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And because of fear there is also a meaning of death that arises.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 It is from these things that someone gives up his own pain and says this to you hoping for health: the pain of him is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore it should not be believed by anyone who has come from them whose mode is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And there must be greater caution on your part than desire and greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 Do not believe anyone who is above something without a certain knowledge that can confirm the success of what they have come to do praiseworthy from you.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 To ensure that your health is taken care of through the care and attention of all who are weak and to predict and indicate what is better for you than this.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 This is an aid on your part in the acquisition of fame and glory as well as memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 "Inspiration comes from God's sons, his mind gave you neither direction nor guidance," because that is in their hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 "I have ordered this chapter distinguishingly by chapters, as it precedes the chapter on Cautery, from the calf of his leg to the feet: so that you may find what is necessary for your healing through him and how he should be used.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 "Of the collection of waters gathered by children's hands.
Caput I.	 "Chapter One.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 "Behold that these injuries frequently occur in children at birth, or when the midwife pulls away from the infant's head.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 "And also those that happen and are not known by reason of a secret cause.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 "I have not seen this weakness in others as I do in children, and death has come upon all whom I have found to be affected by them: therefore it is a necessity that I should cease operations on account of these.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 "I have seen the child whose head was bound tightly with water and its head became large all through each day until it could not rest upon itself because of its own size; and the moisture increased until death occurred.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 "And this very moisture can also gather between the skin and mouth, or gather under bone above the pubic hair.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 "Operations on that are done when there is moisture between the skin and mouth; the pupil of the eye becomes blurred then it is necessary to find a fissure in length as a single opening at right angles: its length will be like two fingers until humidity runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 "These are flat.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 "If it is more greatly increased and the pupil becomes larger then two fissures should be made as above in shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 "If the moisture is under bone and its sign is that you can find openings to the head of the hair from all sides; water will be depressed when pressed with your hand against it on the inside, and not hidden by you: then it is necessary for you to make three fissures in length as above.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 After making an incision extract completely and entirely
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 And then sew up the incisions with bandages and cotton wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then bandage it over completely, all the way to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then apply a ligature and care for the wounds with plasters and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 Do not remove the bandage evenly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And keep the member free from all wetness and moisture until it is recovered and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another mode of making an incision is to determine when a great many drops appear on the bandage; at this point you should collect water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 When there is more bleeding from one side than another or if it happens suddenly and unexpectedly, make a second incision for additional drainage of blood.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the drops and gather up the water; thereafter do it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you don't cut into the artery and cause blood loss; also see to it that the patient does not die from the flow of blood with removal of wetness.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Of the arteries which are on the sides after.
Caput II.	 The head is second, and its surgical techniques:
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When a cataract happens on the eye or forehead and becomes old; at this point care is no longer given to it; then there is a last incision made into both of its arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 It therefore happens that you cut through the eyes so that the patient may recover his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then bind up with a bandage to see if the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 And then bind him tightly to his own bandage.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Consider when one artery bleeds.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Its locations are the ones that are on the sides of the body and which are depressed; they usually close up unless certain persons occur.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then with a wax seal on top of each; and cut through both with a small pointed knife into the eye to its length; then lay it in place by its height along the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 "And if you are making a cut through an artery and it bleeds more than is necessary, stop cutting immediately.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 "The length of the cut should be about two fingers' width.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 "If a vein is cut and blood begins to flow quickly from it towards your inner parts.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 "However if the artery does not seem to be bleeding but you feel a space of three fingers' width at its point of incision, continue cutting.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 "Then seal it with wax and hold it up to your mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 "The amount of blood that should be emitted is one ounce, sometimes more, sometimes less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 "Do this according to the quantity that seems to come out from your wound and filling up the artery of it as much or as little as needed.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 "Then look at the mouth.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 "If anything remains in the mouth from the blood clot and you still feel hot, then make a cut there to prevent the cold finger.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of it with ointment until it is cured.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 "Of extracting arteries that are hidden away.
Caput III.	 "Head 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 "When a man has an ancient stroke or sudden attack due to acrimonious humidity and coldness of the veins, or from old sores, wounds, etc., and he is treated with the methods of medicine: then we make our expertise in extracting the arteries out of the times, or cauterizing them as needed.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 "The method for extracting those is to pull out the hairs that are in the time and direct it towards a visible artery of the same place.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 "That method will be shown to you from your pulse and it is rare that it stays hidden unless in a few people or coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 "If you cannot do this yourself then the physician should wrap your head with his own cloth and afterwards worry about it.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 With a hot towel (applying heat), you will see a visible manifestation
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take a smooth sponge that I prepared before
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 After cleansing with it, you will see a quick and easy healing effect.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 After using it once, place it on top of the affected area and gently pull it out after a short while, ensuring that you remove it from the skin completely to avoid any residue on your clothes.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is very thin, then apply it with gentle forceps.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 After cutting off a small piece of the artery according to its length and contraction/expansion with forceps so as not to allow any blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 If it is not cut or if it is not removed, there will be no bleeding.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then wash the artery with six douches using warm water until three douches have passed.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large, you must apply it to two places with double cord forceps or a knife so as not to let any infection set in before sealing and allowing blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 After cutting off excess tissue between the two cords.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that time or after some other time.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if there is a need for sealing it with a cautery until the extremities have been cut through and the location has been secured.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 It's better to do this procedure unless there is an illness that requires cooling of the affected area.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Since cautery has been used in order to drain off the fluids.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore, it is better to do this procedure.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 After removing the artery and securing its location with a knot, you should place a small piece of felt over it to prevent any more bleeding.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 After the application and mixing with fresh water which causes flesh to come out, you should use vinegar so as to treat it.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 "If blood flows from the artery during surgery and if you want to stop it immediately using a clamp with care or by saying 'stop' loudly until bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 "If there is nothing else present in your hand at that moment, then place a finger over the wound until bleeding stops.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 "And cover the wound with cold water to stop the pain and bind according to what is needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 "And if it is easier and quicker to remove an artery with a clamp held by two assistants in the same manner as the first assistant, both of their knives are similar.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 "However, there is less pain compared to two assistants using the same method.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 "Because if they are very painful, it should be done in pairs with ice and not hit the body when you put on a bandage.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 "Therefore, if there is a little excess of fat, you should put heat on them with fire and remove the body or sooner when this method is used better than all other operations, faster.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 "And if the space between two assistants is great due to excess of fat fingers after signing and depositing both with wax until they are filled up their mouths and hit one by hitting them on both sides, so that what is inbetween his extremities can be stretched.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 "They do not become consolidated because of this method's pain.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 "This is the form for the clamp.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 "About how to treat acute and painful tears from eyes.
Caput IIII.	 "Chapter Two.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 "When there are acute and painful tears from the head of eyelids outside the eye, do not let anything be cured by medicine with doctors; rub your face to remove the redness that came from the eyes; and feel a movement in your forehead as if you were moving your eyebrows; so it is for those who have been removed. And his eyelashes are heated because of the pain of tears: then they will endure this operation, and call it treatment.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 "The hair of one who is afflicted with baldness should be plucked from his head.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three cuts on the forehead evenly spaced according to its length; and let each cut be as long as two fingers, and one is half a distance between the nostrils, and second in accordance with the motion of the tongue, and third at part from the other; and also cut both your hands down along the length of your mouth so that there is space for all incisions to join together. And let you remove any sponges or towels soaked with too much blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then introduce a small sharp tool of two types, the one being followed by form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision that is to part of time, until the second incision; and with it remove all the cut that is between two incisions, up to the upper lip (sifac).
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do this as well from the middle incision up to the second one.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove this small tool and introduce the other one called the sickle-like sharp tool from a part of its length; not from another part but at its length.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 He then puts the sickle-like sharp tool into use with its handle attached to flesh and its length towards the mouth; he pulls it so that it moves until it reaches the middle cut; and removes all the cuts, which go down from the head to the eyes, except for the incision that goes up to the face.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do this on the middle cut until it reaches another one.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 After running out of blood with equal quantity, remove the locations from which the coagulated blood flows out.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then puts on all incisions a mixture of old wine and raisins soaked in vinegar or oil.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 He instructs that there should be no cold water running in it.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 The third day you should apply a ligature and administer an infusion with heated water
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then cure that by applying the ointment of Basilisk, and all others which require healing wounds until they are healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 For curing headaches and cataracts from the inside of your head.
Caput V.	 The top
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When a cataract occurs to him and he becomes blind: And you stretch his eyes out, and make them pale, and then the aspect of them is weakened, and there are ulcers on their eyelashes, and hairs fall from them, and acute pain in deep part of head, it hurts badly, with tears. And as a consequence, there's an affliction. Then take this material, and the cataract comes back unless you come by many times
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And after that, their cure is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 So the head may be lowered back with great effort.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make an incision in the middle of his face and do it either way by length or breadth: And begin with a cut on the left side towards right, until you reach up to the mouth: And stretch your hand out from the teeth's time, which fall at mastication: Until when the mouth is reached: And you will dry all blood completely with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then make an incision between the two lips and use a piece of linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And then tie it up with cotton wool, and take in pulses together with wine and oil so as not to let the cold enter into the eyes.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you have done that, and it is clear that the cold eye has already come near to him, then you must put something warm into his nose until he starts to come out of the flesh by breathing in air.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then cure him with a regimen of hot things which bring forth the flesh: as if you take two parts of bran boiled wheat and four parts of colophonia: And prepare from them an ointment, and administer to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Of his eye that has fallen out
Caput VI.	 The sixth cranial nerve
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls out of the eye is one of four species: either a mineral stone or a small piece of rock like iron, or a discharge; or it comes from the eye itself, just like tears and phlegm, or food residue - whether liquid or solid-like substances resembling them.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When therefore a stone falls out of the eye, or from these that are not added to it and do not grow on it, you should expose only the eye itself: if by chance you see the stone then distill into the eye something oily like oil or syrup.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer an eye wash to him and proceed with the cleansing as you put the nose's nostril plug from ear hair: after placing a band around his head, remove the ears that are above
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Many things will occur during this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not work then proceed with the eye wash using the technique of pulling on a fine thread: this is its form.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it works as expected.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not then proceed with the eye wash using a small blind thread that doubles in length: this is its form.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 And if not then proceed by making a cannula from the ear and inserting its tip into the auricular fornix as far as possible; and apply what is in the cannula with a softened oil so that only it can pass through, after which remove it with your strong pull.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Many things will occur during this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not work this way then take a glutinous preparation or water mixed with gluten that is used to wet the eyes and apply it to its tip as far into the ear as possible: after which you insert it gently in the auricular fornix, when you remove the excess oil from above.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If we have not completed our work with everything necessary for cutting out or sewing in place before the cold becomes too strong, then let's start with warming up and applying a lubricant first
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of making an incision is to remove the limb at the neck (cephalic) if it has become damaged by a phlebotomist's work, and apply another amount of blood from his own veins according to their measure.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 After that, support the limb between your hands and raise it to its highest point, find a suitable incision at the root of the ear near the fat of his body in place, and let there be an opening (lunis) for removing with tools: after which you will remove him with him while what is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 After that, tie off the incision at your time (hora tua) and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If a lump has fallen from one of the veins that are growing or being inflated (inflantur), then you should administer an extraction for him.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, take a thin and fine one according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with him the removal of that type from veins, which have fallen in the ear, and do not remove it when you think about what has become moist by a lot of air inside the ears because of this, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with a hook or with a subtle movement, or with suction, as I said, for removal of him.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 If water gets into the ear (ingreditur), let a patient with a cough first be held back from vomiting and has filled his own ear some old porridge (cotto ueteri) to such an extent that it is now open above her ear where there is water,
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If this happens through the same route, then it's good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 If not, take many stones according to the length of your fingers and warm them with a fire stronger than what is suitable for you, and let him be extracted from one of these (the veins) through the opening of his own ear: and spit over his foot one from that part, and strike another stone on top of it which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 When one stone is taken away from another stone until they are both equal in water
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And as soon as the water is equalized until one of them is removed by fire or an iron implement, and you place both ends together into one beam; then ignite both ends simultaneously with a flame, until all of it is consumed
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then repeat the process with another one, and do this many times until all of it is equalized; then remove that which was previously removed from a stone with a scoop or ladle.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 However, when removing animals caught within it if their bodies are equal to a fox or similar and they need the same care as mentioned before.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if their bodies are large compared to what is visible, then administer the removal of them with a hand gesture and tools; and they will be more easily removed by everyone holding on to it.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the removal of the generations below, when you care for him as described before and with a tool to remove them; and do not offer any more care yourself; then it is necessary that you take hold of its top edge on the ground.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If something appears from above among them, then remove it with a gesture or subtle tools.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If nothing appears there among them, then take the ladle (canula) with its form narrow below and wide above; and insert a subtle end into the beam, according to what is permitted by that which is weak; then suck up it along with strong sucking.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times until all generations are equalized.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you to the end of removal, then collect around them with a ladle and like that which was mentioned before in stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they are not equalized with the one mentioned before, then administer the distillates that were already experienced by others in removing the generations; and you will remove it through the tool of distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And your emission should be as if you had poured oil and medicines into the beam with this instrument whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you would remove an arrow from bone or flesh, inferiorly, where there is a large opening;
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, if the thing to be removed is trapped within a tube (cannula), it should be done from above with less force.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 If you are using a tube (cannula), grasp the forceps and carefully withdraw it with gentle tension at its lower end; then release oil, or allow it to be sucked out by another person, or let it flow from those medical tubes into the cannula itself; after that, introduce the heated iron into the ear canal gently, while feeling for it inside. If it is inserted properly, it will now burn with heat as expected and feel warm within you; if not, do not proceed further with the cold medicine. Medicine should never tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Treatment of auricular injuries
Caput VII.	 The seventh head
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes infants who have been struck on the head by their mothers' blows were not injured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happened to some men that their ears were torn off by the blow of an arrow or flesh;
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And sometimes the injury occurred deep within the ear canal, without causing any further damage; and sometimes it happened just outside of the ear canal where a small tear was made as well.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, when an injury occurs deep within the ear and does not result in any further damage, it is often difficult to treat because of its location in many different places.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 If that which was torn off the ear results from a slight injury, you must apply it to the sole and inspect it there; then if you see an apparent laceration remove it gently with a small, pointed object in order for its form follows closely, so that part of his extremity is somewhat flat while another part sharp: and what remains should be moistened by both sides.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If the injury is caused to flesh within the ear canal you must hold it with a small and sharp object and strike off that which was torn from the flesh gently and swiftly until all of it has been removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 "If heat application is done to deep ear canal, then apply a small, fine brush and warm it with fire before applying the heated brush into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 "If you sense heat from the application of that instrument into your ear which caused a painful sensation accompanied by hearing a ringing sound, then use an opening tool gently to help relieve it and avoid further injury to your ears.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 "After applying the heated brush to your ear and feeling relief, put some ointment made from Egyptian unguent (a type of wax) into it according to the quantity of its pores which you applied earlier in the same way for a few days until your discomfort has subsided.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 "Or apply the ointment directly into the heated water and mix it with honey (a type of sweet syrup) until you form a paste-like consistency, then use that.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 "If you have already applied the ointment to your ear, it is advisable for you to remove that and allow another one which has been made with a mixture of olive oil (a type of vegetable fat) until it becomes hot enough; then apply that one carefully so as not to damage the ear. After applying this one, keep treating it gently until it subsides.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 "If you experience a blood flow (which could mean that your ear has been damaged), then submerge the sponge or wrap it in cold water and apply it to the ear; continue with the remaining treatment, which was used to remove the previous one from the procedure of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 "For the cure of Alteli (a type of eye disease).
Caput VIII.	 The eighth head, also known as the 'sagittae' because it is shaped like an arrow.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 "Those Alteli which strike upon the eyelids sometimes are moist and at other times dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 "Therefore, it is advisable for you to treat them with lashes (eyelashes), or with some other object and hit the Alteli with whatever tool strikes its roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 "Afterwards, apply a paste-like consistency of sweet syrup.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 "If blood flows from them (the Alteli), then burn or cauterize those with a small, fine needle to stop the flow of blood.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 "To cauterize them [the wounds] is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 "For many things return when something has remained from their roots
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 "When cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 "About the treatment of the eyelids
Caput IX.	 "The ninth head
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 "Many a thing happens to the eyelids that is attributed to Grandino on account of his strength and firmness; and because of this he is called Grando: and there is an addition of moisture from both upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 "Therefore an operation is performed on them so that you may see then if Grando proceeds in it what appears from the eyelid and are drawn towards every part; they themselves are easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 "Find therefore a slit with breadth
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 "Then remove it from every part with ease until you reach this slit.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 "Then suspend and separate it using a hook so that you may hold onto the eyelid
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 "If you are not prepared for his detachment unless after penetrating the eyelid with a cut it causes weakness somewhere.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "What if the slit is large then bind and suture them together until they heal
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 "If it's small you will not experience harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 "The healing agent restores and brings them back together
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 "If Grando makes incisions on the inner and outer surface of the ear then suspend it with a hook so that you may hold onto both eyelids until you reach this incision.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 "What if an eyelid is pulled apart by cutting: it does not cause weakness somewhere
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 "Then treat the eye after Grando's incision with a mixture of salt and water until it is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 "About the treatment for Axirna's eyelids
Caput X.	 "The skull of X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 "The eye of X.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "And the manner of his treatment is that he puts an injured head into your hand.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 "Then take a linen cloth and prepare it to wrap around him tightly as if he is in a circle according to the amount that X had wrapped all around.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 "Then put him on it and press down with your fingers from every part so that X will be in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 "Then find in the center where there is moisture from a wound caused by sweat, and do not let the opening be larger than that which occurs during phlebotomy to the bottom.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 "Or it is necessary that you find a whole wound so that X can be inserted into many openings as X proceeded to make a hole for the white veins of the fist.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 "Then remove it with a cloth that you infiltrated between your fingers to the outside and you try again by moving your hand to the right and left until X disperses: so as not to add in the hole, but X can be inserted without moisture in his eye.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 "If you do not see X at the beginning of the wound, then you add into the hole as much with ease.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 "Then remove it like we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 "Then immerse the cloth in vinegar and water, and put them over the place and tie him up with cord.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 "And there are those who brought salt, and put it into the wound so that it will become soft from what remained moist.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of her until she is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If a man falls upon hot coals, care for him with wet cloths until he is cured
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 By the way of treating the eyelids, meaning to make the eyelid soft by using something like a soft cloth or anything that is gentle and not rough so as to avoid damage when wiping it
Caput XI.	 Head Eleven
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When eyelashes grow beyond the normal course under natural hairs in the eyelids and they irritate: then these cause damage to the eyes, causing the mode of tears (lachrymas) which make the eyelid swell and white, until it is destroyed by the causes mentioned earlier.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 The eye treatment is done according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 By burning with fire
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or by using a sharp remedy as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or the eye treatment can be done through cutting and sewing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or by using a spoon as I mentioned earlier.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You should place your head on your arm.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, with the left hand wipe off the tears from the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 Therefore it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 If not it is inserted into the eye in which there is a thread from below the part of the lower eyelid and go through to above with a cloth and tie up near the hairs; that is, near the edge of the eyelids where the hairs are born: and stretch the thread towards the top by wiping off with the lid and tying it with your hand.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then, find where under the hairs are added to the inside of the eyelid until they reach more tears than less tears.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then remove the thread and place a small, thin piece of wax under the eyelid or cloth; then tie it on top with an encrustment as if it were a seal made out of sealing wax.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, the form should be according to the amount and thickness of the eyelid; because this has been diversified among men
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 There is one who causes it to be incised when there's much quantity in the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Afterwards you find two lines on the eyelid that you have marked and then start from the tear duct further down to the tear gland itself, creating a fissure around natural hairs, as it is with the thickness of the finger
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Afterwards, there's an incision made into one of two angles on the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Afterwards you remove everything from it.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Afterwards, with stitching two lips together and using a fine thread and a needle, you remove blood, cut away anything extra from the hairs above both eyebrows and some other things that may be attached to them, if you want to do it - and if not, don't perform surgery
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Afterwards remove the stitching and thread until three or four days later; then you apply a cure for this.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you want to do it without stitches and using only the cure that gets rid of everything and tightens up, go ahead.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 The eyelid swells around the incision and its swelling goes away; but there is something better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 They used this way of treating Ataxmir by old doctors before.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is trouble when it comes to the sick person and it's from a good surgery; but there isn't fear of death involved.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another way is to treat Ataxmir like this; it's like a figure on the eyelid that looks like a death leaf or bird feather, and we use that as well.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Afterwards remove the eyelid with three or more separated and combined angles in accordance to that shape; afterwards make an incision of anything extra using thin blades parallel to that shape until you reach equal parts of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If you cannot hold onto the incision and it does not align with that; then take thread in which shape is there and put it into the middle of the figure; afterwards put another one towards tear gland more, and another one towards tear gland less; and apply stitches between your fingers at equal lengths.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 "Having taken your hand in a similar manner and placing it on top of what is marked as your skin, we proceed like the barber.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Having bound together with stitches the two lips of the mouth after examining him [the patient], I examine him.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 "If the lancet should slip from your hand or fall into a cut of yours, I remove it with my other hand and touch its head to the wound as if applying unguents.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 "And when also the eyelashes are struck through and turned back [in a violent way], we remove them with tweezers.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, let it be as if you have spoken about the incision before; but the artificial stitching is more [difficult].
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 "From the cure of Ataxmir with a dog.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 "And it is as if you are touching both eyebrows and breaking through [the skin] in the same manner that I described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 "Having made two needles or thin rods for a pair of eyebrows (using one in each hand), their length is according to the length of the eyebrows, and their width is less than that of a very fine hair; you have now struck through both ends as if from opposite sides when holding threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 "Having bound together in a similar manner and placed them on the excess of the eyelid after examining him [the patient], I tie with both needles from opposite sides tightly, and release her by degrees.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 "The skin becomes tight and emaciated; it is also diminished and putrefies until it falls off on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 "If the time comes to do this after all, then I strike her with a barber's shears.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 "After examining him [the patient], I examine him.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 "When the bandage is tightened and the eyelids are in good condition; they do not hurt the eyelashes.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 "And this is the form of two needles or rods that I mentioned before, their length according to the length and width as described.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 "Having placed a bandage on the nose after examining him [the patient] with the eyes.
Caput XII.	 The twelfth head
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 Operation on this is to cut it with a small knife and insert it into the head through an incision made from soft tissue
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Next, tie the extremities of his body with two knots made from fine thread; make one end longer than the other.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 After that, cut off a little bit of the thin thread and tie it to an extremity of his body; make sure to leave some left over.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Finally place the patient's head on your lap and perform the operation; because it is a delicate or small operation
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 After that, insert the little finger on your hand into his eye and gently guide it towards the pupil; when you have inserted it, remove a small piece of the natural eyelashes.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Lastly, draw out the little finger until it is above the eyelid; then insert a finger into the same eye; if there are one or two or three fingers, do not put more than that many.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 After that, take your hand with him until you reach the little finger at the top of his eyelid and guide it gently towards the natural eyelash.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the little finger is pulled out and does not reach it; pull off one end of your thread to the lower eyelid with that you made in her and guide it gently towards the superior eyelid until you reach the top of his eyelid; then tie a knot on both ends, close the eye for two or three days until the eyelash regrows, and put the little finger back up there.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the little finger is very short; either tie it to a longer one made from eyelashes or remove it completely until it grows out and then put it back in place after some time.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Care of the eyelid which was injured.
Caput XIII.	 The thirteenth head
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When an injury occurs to one eye, it is called a livida (blepharitis).
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 This is either a natural occurrence or an accident.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Accidental means resulting from the falling of flesh on another object due to carelessness in handling tools used for surgery, such as a fall while holding a scalpel or tweezers, or by cutting oneself with a knife during surgery.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of the operation is as follows: you must find the incision point and separate his lips from them, then place what lies between them on it so that it can be removed from there with a linen strip, after which he should be bandaged up.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 Do not allow what excrete and constrict his things to do so, because if you do this it will be worse than before. Instead, you should take the excreting items gently as though you were using a broom with water, covering it in damp linen: and anoint with oil of lavender, which has been prepared from olives: and unguentum of aloes, which is made from honey.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 The collection for your care must be as comprehensive as possible to not leave any gaps, according to the first shape that was used initially.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This is only a correction of Albucasis's operation to ensure that the form was not lost throughout the entire process.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 The care for Albucasis on the lower eyelid is either a tearing or closing up of both sides towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 The twelfth chapter.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This is Albucasis's care on the lower eyelid and it is called Albucasis's eye ointment.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is either a natural occurrence or an accident.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 Accidental means resulting from the falling of flesh on another object due to carelessness in handling tools used for surgery, such as a fall while holding a scalpel or tweezers, or by cutting oneself with a knife during surgery.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of the operation is as follows: you must grasp it with two fingers and pull gently on it while placing one end into the flesh to reach across it towards the left tear duct and right tear duct simultaneously, until both ends are pulled out from the body.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 In this direction, extend the arm up towards the shoulder with a sharp blow, and strike it with a blunt one at its side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If that brings about the second figure of the eyelid as is fitting, this is good news.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 If not, take the radius and place it into a cut, and strike with it the eyelid; and find two cuts in its inner surface of the eyelid, and there are two cuts from both angles of the incision, until they meet and there is an angle made by them: thus when they come together will be the figure of these, and this is Greek writing.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Afterwards, remove that arm along its length, which is the lower edge of it; from this follow the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Afterwards separate the two parts; sew her with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Afterwards care for them as we have mentioned in connection with medicines and ointments until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if Alixatria strikes through the cut and sutures or cauterizes; then you must ensure that there is a flat cut beneath the eyelashes and also as before mentioned.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterwards separate between the two lips with a thread, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And finally the end of our treatment for Alixatria when it is above or below should be such that it goes into this operation according to what was prepared from the shape of Alixatria
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 This is the figure of many differences arranged: and a wise workman, when he wants to bring it into its own form, or one close to it, and himself weak according to what has been done for him by means of operations and instruments in several arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 The eyelid with conjunctiva, or the cornea.
Caput XV.	 The fifteenth head
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Whenever this consolidation happened to many people, in such a way that the upper eyelid is consolidated with its white of the eye and should be prevented from its own natural operations
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 "You should then insert the tip of your thumb under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a knife; thereafter cut into it gently with a sharp, thin instrument, such that there is no discomfort from the incision's sharpness; so that you do not worry about an ill-at-ease patient when performing the operation. And after the eyelid has been removed smoothly, then let your incision be closed as before.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 "At that point in the eye, you pour salt water into it; or distill it out using factum or ziniar, by dissolving with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 "Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen strip; and place above the eye a soaked strip of linen with alum (alumina). After three days use factum or ziniar to remove it along with any crusts that may have formed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 "From incisions in the eyelid and areas around the eyes.
Caput XVI.	 "Chapter Sixteen
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 "Know that an eyelid can be removed using two methods.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 "Or it may be plucked gently; and with a soft, thin instrument similar to factum or ziniar.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 "Or it may not be plucked gently; and is similar to a frozen piece of white cloth that can be torn with the knife or grasped by using factum or ziniar; then cut away from there.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 "The other two types of eyelid removal do not start until the eye is already more swollen; they gradually let go slowly and stop opening up or moving the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "And the method to remove it is as follows: place your patient's head in yours, so that you can see how they have made a slit at an angle.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 "Then open up their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 "Then secure the eyelid tightly with two or three fingers of factum or ziniar; and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 "Then take a thread from the tail of a horsehair and its corresponding hair; or some other fine thread: make it strong, double both ends with factum or ziniar to secure it tightly; fasten this into the slit in the eyelid; pull gently on it; extend it upwards; and remove any hairs that follow the pupil. And if you hold onto it up until their forehead, then release it at the very end of their eye.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 In the event that no tears are shed from an injury to the lacrimal gland itself or through its ducts with small spatulas (needles), it is necessary to remove the natural meat of the lacrimal glands, lest they be injured by continued incision and repeatedly weeping.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 Or when a hook or a single cord extends along with it; just as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then they are scraped off with blunt spatulas, which is their shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And as well, if the blunt spatulas should come into contact with the cornea of the eye; they would cause injury and tear away the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 After an incision has been made, if anything salty is introduced to the eye; either from a blow or a sharp object, it should be removed until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 And after that thing with which treatment is required, must remain uncured for as long as necessary
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the hook is not smooth and cannot be introduced into it without injury; then this species of hooks must repeatedly be scraped off with medicines and they are cured just as they are scraped from urine in a dish.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you make an incision into it; then open the eye and take blunt spatulas gently, weakly, badly made but of a small size, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And after that, scrape off the hook with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that the thing is to be removed and must be separated from it and reason dictates it; then distill out of your eye by a blow or sharp object, salt water, or an oily rag, until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the same treatment until all is removed from him.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there are hot ashes in your eye; then immediately remove it and treat the ashes until they are cured.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the same treatment with reason until all is removed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, the natural meat of the lacrimal glands if it causes great harm to the eye, should be scraped off with a hook and cut away from that part of them; so as not finally to make an incision lest they continue weeping excessively.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore, when tears fall from a tear duct due to sneezing, it should be treated.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 "From the incision of the eyeball and the flesh that enters the eye.
Caput XVII.	 "Head seventeen
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 "Sometimes blood from the eyes of men is collected together or overlaid on the pupil, so that it can close the eye, or protrude forward to the eyelashes and turn them outwards; and in some cases, it turns the eyelids towards the outside; and it becomes accustomed to the roses.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 "And there is also an operation involved so that a patient can put their head into your lap
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 "Therefore open his eyes and lay the whole flesh with the fingertips over it; hold it with one forceps or a hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 "Therefore cut off the meat first so that all of him is completely finished when he has been cut off by an instrument
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 "And also from the eye so that you do not leave him at the operation; and your incision should be made in such a way that he is inserted by the same instrument, or with spatules which we have used for cutting off the eyelashes; or with scissors, according to whether it will take shape or finish his head.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 "Therefore, when your incision is completed and the whole of the eyeball has been removed, then a drop from his tear duct should be treated; or it may evaporate its blood along with tears to cool him.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 "If anything remains from the eyeball, and you are dominated by a cold blood; then lower it, and take care of him as he nurses the eye.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then repeat with your operation so that he is treated.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 "And similarly do the same thing to flesh which falls into the eye by this method.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 "However, it is necessary that the care for all the weak eyes from a natural or accidental path with iron; and you should not insert your hand into any of their operations unless they are done.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 From the eye socket
Caput XVIII.	 Head 18
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The new eyelids that cover the eye and prevent any movement of its own; they weaken it over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore first of all you must know that if the eyelid is strong and there's no moisture or other condition on it besides the eyelid itself, then attach (put) the eyelid onto him/her.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And you must also be mindful of any weakness, to put your head into place inside yours.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then hold the new eyelids with a single one or two fingers according to your prudence; and there should be a soft uncinus that adapts itself, so it can adapt to both forms of attachment, either as one uncinus inside the body, or as two uncini in one body.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then attach the new eyelids with soft fingers and gently remove blood after removing it from the eye until they are removed; and so that the eyes will not be damaged by the softest parts of the hands.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And your work should take place before the sun rises and you should remain firm during your work; so that only these new eyelids are to be touched.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have removed them, then pour into the eye either a drop of oil or mucus; so that its natural oil is washed away by their sharpness and they remain after removing from the eyelid.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If you are not able to attach the new eyelid in that same time or if doing so causes eye pain; then take another eyelid and apply heat by warming with hot water, until the first eyelid is removed and its pain subsides; and secure it from frost by wrapping in a warm cloth after removing. Then repeat this process again for him/her according to the same method, until the pain is gone.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And that's how you do surgery with your fingers.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Of reduction of the nose
Caput XIX.	 Head 19
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physicians call the fistula Arissati by whatever treatment it is done with; whether cautery or acute burning medicine.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 "If it cannot be cured, then there is no skill in that; unless you find a skilled surgeon who was born to him and takes away the whole moisture which exists in him until he is treated.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 "When it has been treated [i.e., the moisture], you will see if there was a corruption or injury; then apply him with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 "And the name of the treatment for the head wound is Aspri.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 "Let the head be treated with iron; and let it become round like Aspri as long as its wound is treated according to the ways of Aspri or Aliskilfer, either using a lancet or a needle from Aspri or a subtler one for puncturing: and place him upon a corrupting ossus.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 "Then withdraw the head between your fingers and place both hands upon it until you know that the corruption is already healed; then do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 "Then restore its place with medicines of excisius (i.e., excision) and stitches.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 "If the place is thus restored and new flesh grows up there and the course of the wound is cut off; then it remains for thirty days without returning or becoming worse, not harmed by any accident; you know that he has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 "And if this is not the case, then there's no skill left in him unless a skilled hand reduces his fist to its nose according to that shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 "And if the bone is broken in a second place; or with iron; and when his mouth has been treated, then you take the rod according to that shape, it being iron-like at one end, triangular: and its wood should be cut from him so that it reaches all the way down to his extremity as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 "Then place this upon his mouth and let it be near tears; and stretch out your hand from the mouth as little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 "Then withdraw your hand with the rod until it penetrates his mouth and he feels that; by this means you may make a hole to let out any bad breath from him when you place your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore restore a place with the help of medicines sprinkled upon it like I have done unto you
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 The body is born and hardened at that place; then the material which had been on its outside returns to the nose; hence it is better for the sick one of this kind.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 On the reduction of importance/size of the eye
Caput XX.	 Head XX
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye is complete and does not fall upon a foreign body, nor decrease; then it should be applied to an invalid person; thereafter, you must take bloodletting from him; later place warm sponges on his forehead without any scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 After that you must apply to the eye a mixture of acacia, aloe, and olive oil and sardine sauce
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 After that you should draw up the eye above the eyebrow with multiple filaments.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 The manner of the filaments is as follows: you take from them loose hairs and many, and stretch out all of their hair over four; make some of these, and put one on another according to quantity like the eye; then draw up them with a hard cloth in great force.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And apply warm sponges without any scarification using suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 After that you must remove the warm sponge and let the eye rest for one day and one night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the other filaments loosen up, then you must draw them up in great quantity; after that remove the filaments for one day and one night as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If the eye has become clear of its bandage, that is a good thing; if not, then you apply the bandage again and the filaments as before until he is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 On the cutting/incision of the eyelid band
Caput XXI.	 Head XX1
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When the disruption of the eyelid bandage occurs then it is restored and goes out to the corner like a grain of pepper; and becomes its form due to this, and you should cut into it, so that an operation upon him is made as described before, according to what I have said; and thereupon when you approach at the root of the eye from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 "Then you should enter into another vessel where there is a double-threaded vein apart from the lacrimal one and then force it to penetrate.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 "Then you should cut off the two vessels of that vein and tie around its part a small loop so as to tighten it.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 "Then you should take out the thread and put around the eye a piece of floss so as to tie it with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "And then carefully apply pressure on that eye in order for its inflammation to subside.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 "When you tie around the vein from all parts with a strip of cloth until it becomes prominent and large.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 "And then gently press and pull with fine spatules until the moisture from the back of the eye gets to its deepest part and the eye descends, and is immediately tied up so that it does not slip away; but if it slips, tie it again.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 "On account of the treatment of the [eye].
Caput XXII.	 The twenty-second chapter is about the head.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This treatment, which is called "Alcomnatis," unless it causes the eye to get better and swell similarly as tears descend from it but doesn't cause pain itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 The method of doing this is by either having a fixed pillow placed on the head or turning towards one side to make it sit comfortably with its head raised and directed.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 "Then take his head in your two hands from the front by two parts and move it until both of its eyes are looking down.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 "It becomes still and does not go downward; the light is shut off and it is dark inside of his eyes as it was before, but if that did not happen you should know that it may be because there was water in his eye.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 "If the descent of the inflammation with him is not as we said then you should lay the patient between your two hands and keep holding them there.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 "Then gently press with fine spatules and find him in the superficial skin over the outer layer of the eye so as to gently hold it within a covering made by the combination of his eyelid and the cornea until he gets better.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Having heated up the eye with warm water that you had applied earlier for the treatment of eye diseases, or with water from which you had previously applied ointment made from iris and honey; then I cured him after proper cleaning.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 "For curing of that water that has descended into the eye, or for cataracts.
Caput XXIII.	 Head (Twenty-Third).
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 Having received that water for making a small incision and applying a bandage to the patient after proper preparation.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 "Then you should let the patient lie down between your hands square and opposite to the sun; bind his eyes securely with a bandage after proper preparation.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 "Then take the bandage in your right hand if it is on the left side of his head; or with your left hand if it is to the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 "Then with your right hand gently and carefully place the bandage over his forehead passing through the length of your arm to the visible part of the tear; then pull it tight as you can after proper preparation.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 "And make sure the measurement of the bandage reaches to the bottom, which is from the pupil up to the end of the black part.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 "Then gently place it on his eye with the help of your other hand for the benefit of the clear cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 "Finally, place the bandage until you reach where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 "Then, with your other hand press downwards gently to remove it from his forehead after proper preparation.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 "If water descends immediately, the patient should hold the bandage above his opened eye and place it on his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 "Then you are finished.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 "If water descends immediately then remove the bandage from your second hand after proper preparation to avoid it falling on him when he is lying down between your hands.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When this happens and does not rise up, then you take it out with ease and quickly give your hand to it
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve it in water into some clear beads; and wash the eye with that.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then put all around the eye a piece of cotton wool soaked in rose oil; and wash with it the eye clean.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But for those who are our contemporaries we put on him a mixture of alum and vinegar
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the almond does not soften and become soft enough in your hand to be introduced into the eye because of its hardness; since it is from men whose eyes are hard, that is to say, you must take a file, which is called an alberid, whose shape this is.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore take it gently with your fingers and do not put the hand into a hole; unless you make a way to the place of the almond subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the almond according to what we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the bedside of your work will be provided with an infirm rest, in which he lies on top of his back in a dark room; and shall not move from all movements, nor by any means: and you put food for him that relieves his nature, but not to move his head right or left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And the ligature according to its placement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark room and make him see his own face; and do whatever you can to help the man recover.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 And reduce the ligature until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary to do that when the time for care comes or after an operation at once; but it is necessary to take away that from someone else so that water rises quickly through a severe aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If the hot oil has burned an eyelid then it is necessary to wash out the eye before seven days and correct that with something that settles the oil until it is settled; after which you should wash off his own face from above where he rules himself under for a certain number of days, in such dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 As you enter into your home gradually and get used to the circumstances of yours
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 You should know that any pupil is excused from practicing on another's body more than once. At that point the student may perform an operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 There was a certain person from Alayrah who said that he had made an incision on Alayrah's finger with water for purification
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Indeed I did not find anyone of yours who had done it; nor was there found a book from an ancient one containing this matter; and it is possible that what he said might be new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are the shapes of the things from Alayrah as long as who does not know them remain under them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 They should be formed with proper breath; and the extremities of theirs should be in the same triangulation as this, acute extremity.
Formae magda.	 The shapes of Alayrah.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 From the cure of fleshly birth to the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Head twenty-four.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 When the fleshly birth occurs in the nose of divers kinds added on, from which there is something that assimilates many feet scorpions; and from it is the flesh cancerous, pale idea, colors of the fox: and from it is what is the flesh soft, not fox coloring.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore what from these flesh is soft and not deceitful or cancerous should you make to rest the ill-willed one between your hands opposing alone with open one in those flesh: thereafter draw them out towards the outside and strike that which you comprehended ex itis through spatulously sharp but on a part once, until you know that all the flesh is now entirely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If anything were left from that whose removal was not possible; then take it with one of the subtleties of instruments and easily thereafter until nothing remained from him.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If your blood were dominated by you or it fell off a cold hand; then apply to him what is necessary through that; or if there are venomous apostemes, then carefully burn the one until the blood departs and all of the flesh was burned away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 After making a cut in the nose, apply vinegar and water, or wine
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If there is bleeding from the nose, proceed by applying moisture up to the palate until it stops. At that point you can say that he's well again
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the moisture doesn't penetrate into his nose as it should, you can say that the knife has entered into his upper nasal cavity and cannot be removed by itself.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then you should insert a thread of some thickness to remove the clots and mucus from his nose. After this, you must gently lift out each obstruction with your fingers, either one at a time or in groups as much as necessary: And you will have to keep them clean until they are removed completely; and then you can proceed upwards towards his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 Many children do this for their teacher at school because it is an easy task to perform.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 After that you place both your hands on his face, one over the nose and the other remains in his nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 After that the surgeon removes the thread with all the obstructions it has collected.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Until you know that his flesh is now free from the thread and its obstructions.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 After that you extract the thread; and apply the Egyptian unguent to his nose after the blood has been removed with it: do this for three days or more until the unguent has completely dissolved what remains on the body.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 After all of that you place a plug in his nose to stop the bleeding and keep him from breathing through it for some time until he is well again.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If the cure does not work, then try another one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To remove the nose hair you should use olive oil or other remedies applied to the nose; put it in as if you were putting an onion into your own nostril and breathe through it.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you make a plug that is sealed tightly like a canna.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 In order to perform an operation on the brain, it must be full of instruments; one who holds his hand by its thumb should have his arm extended; when you warm up with oil, or what comes from the scissures, and all other things flowable
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 The 25th head
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 A nosebleed often occurs at the end of the nasal cavity; it is large and increases with time until a clot forms that blocks its view.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 For this reason one must take care so that the appearance of it at first begins from him and he removes all of it completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Afterwards place a bandage on top or burn with a cautery or apply a medicated ointment in the location where that occurs.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If this delay occurs, until it becomes large; then consider if there is a stone, or any other hard thing in the way that causes pain on feeling. Then do not touch with iron, because such a touch will make cancer spread.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Indeed, many times have I seen that when an arrow hits the eye of someone it causes great harm to him who had held it
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 If the touch of the arrow is light and does not cause bleeding, then do not cause it pain in color or look at what incision can be made all over him; then apply a warm compress and strike lightly without fear or haste until he is cured.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Of the nose, and the lips, and the ears.
Caput XXVI.	 The 26th head
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 For this reason the operation of loosening the continuity of one or more cartilage is often unsuccessful unless in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore when something comes out of him do you look to see if it is a recent wound with his own blood; and then apply the stitches immediately so that he will be cured.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 If the cartilage is already separated and one or more parts of it has been made whole; then you must make the incision through all its apparent extent until bleeding stops.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 In the meantime make a two-layered cut with sutures and tie them together, then pierce through it with an awl, break off its top part to leave just its base; next bind both ends of this base tightly to form a loop and put on another piece of string or cord: afterwards you may remove the first tied knot after two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 After that, exchange the treatment (medicine): then release him from his bonds as needed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 After tying together and piercing through it with a awl: after being treated with ointment, he will be cured
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of tying is as follows: either with continuous thread or with a needle, like we sew up the mouth of an animal: either tie together the solution and thread, like I taught you to do before.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 In order to remove hair from the eyelids (eyelashes).
Caput XXVII.	 The 27th head.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people's eyebrows are very thick and hard to remove, some of them less, others more.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore it is necessary that you cut the eyebrows down to size and remove all of his hairs with a razor or scissors; afterwards tie him up again.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 After piercing through and cutting off the top part: afterwards you have tied up, then release the blood.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Afterwards bind him tightly with vinegar and tie it securely, where there is stiffness: until all ulcers are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Of the cutting off of a finger nail over the ginkgo leaf
Caput XXVIII.	 The 28th head
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Many times more fat is added to the finger nail over the ginkgo leaf, compared with those that are called bulbuls.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore it is necessary that you tie her tightly with a razor or scissors; or hold her securely in place using tweezers and cut off the end of her finger nail close to its root, and then release both blood and skin so as to allow them to run free, or let him bleed.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Afterwards bind the place tightly with thread, and others tie their eyebrows short and tight, until they are healed.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 "If she is unable to deliver it immediately after receiving (it), as often happens, then cut her off at the second time and burn/sear her.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Regarding teeth with a steel instrument
Caput XXIX.	 The 29th Head
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When the teeth are collected together on the top and bottom of both the inside and outside parts, and when they have been separated with a blade between the edges of the gums and cheeks, then if they fall out or become loosened, they disappear; otherwise, they remain, except for those lost through corruption to their roots.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore let you sit on him with your hands and bring his head into yours, and grind and tooth in that place where the edges appear to you; unless anything remains of them, do it similarly with a razor blade also, for both of you and all others until they become detached.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore the reason of teeth is fulfilled at first, that is good; but if not, then there will come another day for them to fulfill their purpose again, and a second one after this, until finally it may be completed in doing so.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And you know that the reason of the teeth is different from one shape to another and many forms; according to what preparation for your operation: first, when a razor blade cuts off the tooth below (from its base), it is different with respect to where it is cut between the teeth itself, depending on various shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these forms of razors are prepared for you that you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 About the extraction of toothache
Caput XXX.	 The 30th Head
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 So that you heal the tooth with all your intelligence and try to get rid of it completely.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 It is not that he who administers it will be healed when it is removed; because its essence is sublime: unless a reason for removal of it is excused until then, then one must administer the toothache to him in order to relieve him and verify with you whether his teeth are aching.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 "For when pain is felt by a diseased tooth and he believes it has been removed from the tooth; after that however no relief of pain occurs until the diseased tooth itself is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 "We have seen this in the veins as a result of phlebotomy (bleeding).
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 "When the toothache is certified by you (the reader), then it must be that some remedy should come from the application of certain substances on the teeth with a brush or similar; until the usefulness is satisfied and all pain goes away: after which point move the finger to its place, either with your fingers or with delicate tweezers first and foremost.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 "Then locate the finger firmly onto its place and bring your head between your thighs (while sitting or kneeling); you have held it well until now, so that it does not move away from its place after all: then pull out the tooth as per the correct position, lest it be broken.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 "If that does not work, then take one of their instruments and slide it underneath from all parts with ease; and compare its movement as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 "If the tooth is perforated or corroded; then it must be that you plug this hole with a cloth and bind it with your delicate fingers until after all: pull out with your fingertips gently as not to break at the time of your tightening, lest it break when being pulled by the tweezers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 "And it is necessary that you apply the scraping with a toothbrush on all sides of the teeth thoroughly and often.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 "And be mindful of your strength so as not to break it and let the part remain, and so that any evil causing harm greater than his first pain will cease.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 "And also be mindful that you do not do what ignorant ones call phlebotomists by their rashness and audacity; except for doing the things we taught.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 "Many people make great efforts to alleviate the pain of those who are afflicted with powerful afflictions; but some are more difficult to relieve and remain, their roots all; or they will take them out from beneath by certain mandibles [teeth?], just as we have shown that many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 "After its removal is mixed with vinegar (wine) or sour wine.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 "If the blood flow is cut off from multiple places (for it often happens), then apply something from a vessel to that place; and if not, burn (or cauterize) him where he came.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 "The small teeth (forceps) with the help of which cuts through dense first and lasts until long extremities are reached; and if they are closed up when they come into contact with the hand, then bind them with a clamp; if not to the forehand, let them slip off in order not to be doubled. The extremities are bound tight as well, from the forehead downwards, so that none of the teeth may slip away: the short extremities and bind them tightly with a clamp or hold on them firmly until they constrict properly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 "And sometimes (the ends of the fingers) are like those of the beak of a stork and are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 "About removal of teeth and extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	 The end.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 "When something is broken off during the removal of a tooth, it's necessary to apply butter for one or two days until the place becomes soft; and then introduce an algost (some kind of instrument) into that place or use forceps whose handles are like those of a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 "This is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 "The handles are made in this shape, either like a small beak or like a long beak.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 "If you do not succeed in removing it with these forceps, then let the patient lie still and cut off all his meat; and use an instrument called 'Palanca pauper' which is shaped like this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 "The extremities are tight as well in the front as behind, but they should not be tightly bound lest they tear.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 "If it is necessary to remove the root through this path (with these forceps), then it's good; and if not, you will need other instruments with similar handles.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first form of a triangular extremity, containing some thickness
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 A subform of a triangular extremity
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 With the aid of this instrument containing two arms, its form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools that came before them in the reasoning of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 The instrument is now set up with this one that resembles a great hook, whose form being triangularly bent, containing some thickness such that it does not break through; and so the drink may not enter.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And you know that the instruments of teeth are many; and similarly, other auxiliary tools do not count, but a wise craftsman has introduced this tool himself through his own art, according to what operation was given to him by those arts themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Since the instruments were from which they did not mention before any other instrument, because of the diversity of their species themselves.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the mouth is broken off from the jaw or any other bones of the face, or withered; then it shall be examined on that place where he met with him by means of the instruments and forks that I said in extracting the root, and to drink using a hand whose form is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 In that certain thickness is small, so it can be stretched out or held together with him the mouth, and does not fall off nor be used in vain; until the place returns to its own state; and restoration comes with the aid of medicines suitable for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small putrefaction of bone, then he shall remove it from its own corruption and take care of him until he is cured.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 About the repair of broken teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When the teeth of great importance go not according to their own natural course, then there is a wound made by this shape; and especially when that happens in women or children, namely infants.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 You should therefore understand.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 If a dense one is born after the tooth of another and does not lodge there, or it may be his repair; neither incision nor bruising on that part; then you remove him from there; and if he has been attached with another tooth, then strike him with this instrument whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 The face is very small and it bleeds easily from iron wounds, even to the bone
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 Your toothache will go away with the use of this instrument many days and for hard teeth, so that no other toothache occurs from the teeth
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If the instrument is too small or not suitable to fit your mouth, then you must use another instrument with a shape similar to this one.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It is all done with this instrument and its smaller points are not painful at all; just like the sharp point of a needle when it pierces through soft material quickly but painlessly many days later so that no other pain occurs from the teeth, and stops: then release it gently in fine and use it again after some washing.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If the dens is too thick and breaks off part of it or damages your tongue, then you should use another needle as well to pierce through the tongue gently without harming the voice, nor breaking your speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 About removing teeth with the help of an air pipe.
Caput XXXIII.	 The 33rd chapter.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the previous teeth were injured and shaken by blows or from other causes, it was not possible for them to be removed in one day without falling off; so you had to treat them with medical stitches, but they did not heal completely, then the mind within them is there until they are pulled out with an air pipe. For gold can be lost because of wounds and can rot after days, but the ear never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 The air pipe has to be a certain size for its length between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The shape of the instrument for removing teeth is as follows, you insert it between two healthy teeth and then pass it through to another tooth by the double points, either one at a time or several in turn until reaching the other side with your hand up to that point of the healthy tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the procedure until you reach a part where you had inserted it and pull your hand with dexterity and wisdom; do not let go of the instrument until it is removed completely; and make sure there is no slack in the cord as you pull out the instrument at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip off.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 "And then you should cut off the superfluous ends of the fingers with scissors; and also remove both of them together, by cutting across them, while holding their hands gently; and afterwards, secretly insert these between the tooth and gum in such a way that they do not touch the tongue; this will prevent the speaking being stopped.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 "If it should be necessary to tie them with a thread instead of cutting, hold one hand and tie both together using the same thread until they are tied firmly.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 "This is how the shape of teeth should be, and the form of the two healthy teeth, and the two moving teeth; as you do.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 "And sometimes it may happen that one tooth falls out or two teeth fall out after a blow and they stay in their places just as we have tied them; but this will not be done unless the craftsman is wise and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 "And sometimes it may happen that something happens from the jawbone downwards; and this will be like the shape of teeth, placed at its place, as if we have tied them so; but they remain and are fastened with him for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 "Of cutting under the tongue ligament that happened to be cut off.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 "When the tongue ligament that was cut off under the tongue is either natural because it gives rise to man; or accidental after one has become consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 "And the operation is done to make his mouth open gently with its head turned towards you; and release his tongue so that it can speak by itself; then cut off this ligament firmly in length until the language is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 "If there was any kind of hardness or knot in it and it became like a lump from the swelling; then you should loosen it gently by pulling it out with your finger until you cut off the ligament and release the swelling.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "And also remember not to make a hole deep into the flesh so that you may cut the artery there, and stop the flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 After making an incision with water that is hot (or) with vinegar, or with cold water
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Afterward apply a solution of liniment to the tongue which shall hold it soft and moist at all times so that it may not become rigid overnight
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If there is bleeding when making an incision, then apply a compress of vinegar over the location where the blood flowed.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If your finger bleeds when making an incision, then apply a ligature of a linen bandage over the place where it bled and care for him with the remainder of the preparation until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 After removing the tongue flap which falls off from under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 The end.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 When a flap of the tongue falls off from under it and becomes stuck to the underside of the tongue due to the tongue's natural action being prevented by an operation performed on it; and perhaps be magnified greatly in size until the mouth is completely closed
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And there was an operation done upon him so that you can see his tongue from outside of the mouth and consider the flap.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore your finger is injured by bleeding (or) by blackening or being burned and it does not hurt the patient's senses then do not apply any bandage to it because there was a burn.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if the flap is loosened due to whiteness and moisture (or) looseness of the tongue then release it gently with a fine scalpel blade and free him from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If your finger bleeds at the time of your operation then apply a compress over him and wait until the bleeding stops; thereafter proceed with your treatment to remove it together with its remainder.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Afterward applies with vinegar and salt water and care for him with the remaining preparation until he is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 The care of two flap folds in Amigdalar
Caput XXXVI.	 The end.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 When the flaps of the throat are injured (or) those that resemble folds of flesh which occur due to wounds; and they are called two flaps of the Amigdalae: when you care for them as we described above in division, but do not heal, then consider it.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If a sharp point is lacking, its sharpness fades and few senses remain; then it should not be used with iron
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if its root is rough and thick, then it should not be used with iron at all; for fear of the flow of blood, I will let go (of the patient) lest he die (from loss of blood).
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Either you may pierce him through and through or by himself he may be perforated.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if its root is white in color, round, and of a soft nature; then it should be used to pierce (him).
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 The operation on him is thus to be considered before the performance of your own operation; if his sharp point has been quietly completed or was about to be completed by a slight movement - then you should pierce through and through into his body, and place its head in yours: so that he may open his mouth and receive food from your hand.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be with silver or gold, as soft as the yolk of an egg
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 With that premise and it, you will show the point to him, and he will fall upon your hand; then receive one of them by its tail, and bind it in your fist, so as to hold on to it with both hands, except for when you must grasp something from his clothing.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then pierce the other one through with its instrument, following this shape.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 The other one will be received with the fingers; however if its extremities are not straight but curved, then you should use a sharp instrument to pierce through and through into his direction, lest iron poison him or he drinks it in (the alcohol).
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If the other one is not present at that time, then pierce through and through into his direction with a blunt instrument.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 A sharp point on only one side should be used to make an incision; use both sides of it for the other incisions.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 After piercing through one, pierce the second according to this same pattern of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then after making the incision you should take care that he drinks cold water or a mixture of vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If a person is choked with blood, he must gargle water in which the granulation tissues have been burned; either leaves of death or similar things from them are applied to his throat until the flow of blood ceases, then the treatment begins and continues until he recovers
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes birthmarks arise in the back of the throat other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore treat them equally as I said about the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have treated another woman who was born between her tonsils and had a constriction of the throat, which she barely felt when it occurred; but now almost all feeling has been lost in it, so that she can hardly breathe with me closed to such extent as to prevent drinking or drinking water. She is likely to die if this condition lasts for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the tonsils were expanded such that it only felt two openings, until they stretched over the top of the nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore I stopped at one opening among them and closed it up.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I took him by the hand and treated from that great part of his body.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 And then I released her where she had taken breath in through the nostrils.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Therefore I did that thing to him which was brought forth by the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Therefore I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; thereafter I fixed one of the openings in it (the tonsils); then I released part of him from that great bulk which was upon her body, so that he could not breathe out except for a little blood; thus she became well again immediately.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 Therefore I continued to treat him through the tonsils for a long time; and they kept on swelling in that place where I had made incisions, until it was lessened by half and with her thus.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 So I cautorized between his throat the tonsils, to prevent breathing from them: and she recovered immediately.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 And it remained thus until the addition was done away with; then I walked on my side, not knowing what God did with her after this.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 On cutting off the eyelids
Caput XXXVII.	 [No translation is needed for this section as it does not contain any text]
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends down to the eyelid and becomes dry, at that point it is called horizontal; but if it extends further down into the lower part of the eyelid (which can be rounded or flat) then it is referred to as a wane.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When treating it as we described in the section on cutting off, and without performing any further care; if you feel that the eyelid is warm (i.e., inflamed) after this procedure, then you should gently touch/strike it to determine its nature.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if it is a rounded swelling and not very long, and is bloody or dark in color, without feeling any sense of touch from it; then you should make an incision to it (i.e., perform the cutting procedure).
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 In that there is fear of the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the manner that I described from white and its length (i.e., regarding how long it is), so you should gently hold/support a weak eye with sunlight, speak to him using an instrument of which the previous description was given; then take her down below, strike her gently once or twice with two instruments that were mentioned in cutting off the eyelids procedure.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you should not cut into it unless a thing is added over the natural end without any additional part being put on.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 If you strike/cut into it more than that then he will speak and say something.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 After cutting (i.e., after the procedure), apply a treatment/care to it as we described for that procedure; and until it is cured.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the weak eye was shaken away from the cutting procedure, then you should apply your mind to cautorizing it without fear and trepidation (i.e., do not hesitate or worry).
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The manner of cauterization is this; use a sharp hot water to set the weak eye into your hand (i.e., put it on with great care).
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then you should speak to him using an instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 "After taking water as I instructed you in the chapter on cauterizing, and tie it down with that knot so that its heat cannot be extinguished, do not loosen it too much or too little, neither subtle nor coarse, but place it so securely that this instrument's grip is firm.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Place the instrument on its handle (extremities) where medicine grips hold onto it as firmly as an ear's cochlea holds onto a radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument on top of that medicine and keep it steady so that its weight falls downwards towards its own length, as if pulled by an intrinsic force from its mouth, in such a way that nothing comes out of the bottom of it but pain, and let him stay there.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand steady with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And then you put it on the top of that medicine in a quantity and measure with your thumb its size when ready to be burned off, until you bring it down already burned off, and let out only one incision from the medicine's bite.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to take hold of it then place its end over the handle of your thumb and fasten both together with medicine, and insert a radius inside that hole until it holds firmly on top.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times so that you become accustomed to the way of burning off.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let go of it: for itself will burn up and fall after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 And if you wish to repeat the medicine, repeat it again: and after cauterization let go of it when bound with a cord soaked in butter, loosen it while holding on to that which is from the medicine's grip by water; then tie it tightly cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And healing took place externally with ointments, and inside with gargling until he was healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore the incision of surgery is better for health but longer because of fear
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes healing happens with a knot more subtle than the cauterization and incision: for healing takes place when suffocated by that method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 "Take from the plants themselves," etc., such as sumach, hyssop, origanum, rutabaga, sea holly, chamomile, abrotan, similia and others: mix all of them together or some into a drink, and they will sink when poured on oil; if put in the middle of an oil-filled vessel, it will be pushed out through a hollow tool.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 "If you are using an oil lamp, either by the light of day or candlelight," until the wick is soaked and rises up to the top of a hollow vessel where it can be extinguished.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 "Then rinse thoroughly many times, until removed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 "And do not let the beginning of this treatment be performed by someone who lacks experience.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 "But then add some lukewarm water, not letting it happen without the help of an experienced person.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 "But if you do not have this tool present to you at the time, then take a hollow vessel and fill its opening with oil so that it cannot be extinguished; for the wick will prevent the flame from reaching the mouth of the lamp, as the wick prevents burning oil in the same way. And this is done through good care and health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 "From removing the fat (spines) and bones from the broth.
Caput XXXVIII.	 "Chapter 38 is complete.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 "Many times rinse away until the fat and bones are removed or something similar.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 "Therefore let you be released from what appears above where the candle was extinguished after you speak with an instrument at daylight and it is declared to you that which remains in fat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 "And what does not appear to you and hides in fat must be done with a greater amount before the food is digested by the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 "In such cases, it may happen that an additional part will come out through the vessels (intestines).
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 "Or the food is not digested by the person's own body at all (in such cases as when someone has a stomachache or indigestion), and he swallows seawater gently to relieve it, and then drinks something else; or he takes water from sponges of sea-weed and strains it through a fine cloth: and after that, he drinks this.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 "When it is found at a place where the spine and/or mouth are, then it should be extracted there.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 "If not extracted as we said, then you will use the tool from the lead pencil in this manner.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 "It is larger than the radius and its curvature is greatest at its extremity; it enters into his mouth with ease and he himself raises up his head.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 "And it should be handled with the end of his tongue so as not to hurt him in any way, and pulled with him the mouth or spine by hand; or entered into him (the patient) through a surgical incision made with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 "Indeed the one who is weak should enter, that is better: in order to take from him (the patient) as much as he can prepare himself with his knowledge of where the part to be taken was attached; and it should be drawn downwards or pulled by hand together with a tool all according to the amount which has been prepared for him until it reaches.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 "Of the extraction of the phlebotomist (blood-letter).
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 "When the phlebotomist is being treated when he says to divide from the collection along with medicines and does not bind them together, then you should observe at his foot in front of the sun, or if it were after sunset in front of a lamp.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 "If your hand falls upon him while treating phlebotomy, then you should extract her with the hand that was given to you, or gently and carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 "If it is not possible with them, then you should take the cannula and go into her mouth until just before her mouth; thereafter enter him into the use of a heated iron.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 "Do this often and let the patient be free from water for one whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 "Thereafter he should drink a full amount of cold water and open her mouth into it; he should put his mouth inside of it as well and not swallow anything from it; and spit out the water for one hour after another with his own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 With cold water it falls off
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If we do not use the same instrument (which I did not specify), then a supposititious one would be used instead, and if that instrument were to become clogged with mucus or saliva, it could lead to suffocation due to blockage of the airway.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 This is done repeatedly because she/he does this often.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The method of the operation during suffocation is to insert a tube into your mouth, which should have holes through which to pass the breath and air while the throat is protected by the operator's hand on the middle part (forearm or arm) in order to prevent the airway from being obstructed.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 After that the operation of suffocation is completed and the patient's mouth has been inserted into the tube with its end in their throat, if they close their mouth, then the suffocation will not be successful until you know whether the suffocation was successful or not
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 The bleeding quickly falls off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If that does not work, then repeat the procedure many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And if the patient remains quiet and continues to eat, drink, or swallow water after the operation is complete, they will bleed even more.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 It must therefore be done with this method.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument used to remove blood from the throat when it falls on top of your skin.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 The same as a pitchfork is with respect to the manner in which it is used to enter and remove from the throat, unless it has been inserted for this purpose.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 The end of that is similar to the beak on a crane or stork, which has a sharp tip; if it grasps something and does not release it instantly, then it will damage whatever it is grasping.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 In the opening of the aorta, and their sectioning and care regarding that matter
Caput XL.	 End cap U
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 Species of the aorta are many and various depending on how you recall them; for example, one is to remove it (the aneurysm) by its own perforation, while another is to use surgery to remove it from both ends (bilateral).
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One is taken from a species of sponge and comprehends it by moisture
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second one is due to places where it fell off the body
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 If an accident occurs on the head of a sponge, it is another due to its falling off from above; and if it falls from below or out of the body, it is another due to its falling off from below or within (the body). Each of these accidents has its own judgment by operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 Those due to the sponges should not be perforated unless after they have matured within them and are complete; those that are necessary for perforation during their raw state and do not mature in accordance with their purpose.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Like accidents that are near to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 If an accident occurs near the joint and its fall is prolonged, until it has decayed to such a degree that the surrounding ligaments become loosened or the tendons are torn from the joints; this leads to a stronger contraction in those members.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or if the accident occurs at the main member; because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, or its fall is from this main member, a blow to one part may result in injury to another.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or if the accident occurs near the anus and is not perforated mature; do not perforate it unless you have completed its digestion or until it does not putrefy deeply within, and is prolonged to reach into the interior of the anus, a fistula may be formed, or there should be an opening at that part from which he cannot heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You should perforate the sponges as soon as you know they are mature in accordance with their purpose; there is pain of sedation and fever, retraction of muscles, reduction of swelling, decrease in pulse rate, weakening of the strength of the head, other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 You should perforate the sponges at the lower place due to them and make it stronger; if they are on the hands or feet, or places where there is much movement, or tendons, nerves, arteries, veins, or in all the parts equally distant from each other but not reflected back onto themselves.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those parts where a reflection is made, make a hole according to that part.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 If the apostrophe is found in a place that should not have one, it's best to remove the hole and then confirm its removal before continuing to feed him [the patient].
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you make a hole before that, the urine will flow backwards out of him [the patient], and it is foul-smelling, sour, and may cause tears to his eyes, and perhaps the lips are torn off as well, and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 Some [people] make holes according to body width when needed or in the place where it's necessary for a part [of his body].
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is recommended that when you administer through small holes and large holes separately, or cut multiple sections based on the size of the aperture [hole].
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are holes through which it is necessary to bandage up the skin and cut when it has already been done as a piece of cloth or until its expiration [death], so that you may repeat what happened in many cases like this, with bandages and puffs.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And from those holes there are sections made having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from those holes it's necessary to make a cut like the form of paper when killed.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an anus [hole].
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And from those holes sections are made circular and crescent-shaped; and similar sections are also from the cut pieces of them.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 For him who has no head, like superficial holes should perforate [his] body with a shallow hole or flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 When a large hole has already been made and is filled with much blood and you perforate it, [you should] not leave any of the pus out; instead remove from him all of its parts at that time.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 After these holes up to another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Afterwards [you should] remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this repeatedly according to gradation [levels], until you reach a certain point; it is especially important for the weak and the sick, or women who are pregnant, children who are young or old men whose spirits have weakened: because the animal spirit is often removed with the discharge of urine; perhaps they will die if they are weak, but you do not know.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore be careful in this chapter
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 After making a hole for the arrowhead, when you have passed through the aperture and it has removed the feathers, you must stop the wound and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If there is a wound from an arrowhead or if it's just a small cut, then apply linen bandages or old cloth to bandage the wound.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if there is a large arrowhead or multiple perforations of the aperture, you must then go into every wound and apply your linen bandages until they come off by themselves.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you have cut off a part of the arrowhead or encircled it with your hands, then apply a bandage from old cloth and tie it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it well and care for it as you would do with ointment or oil so that it may be healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If there is blood flowing from your hand during the time of your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar after it has soaked into the bandage or cloth. And lay it over the location where there was a great amount of bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the blood continues to flow even after that, then you must apply a cure and care for it as described before in this book of ours and with oil or fat.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 And if there is a time delay and the location of arrowhead injuries is multiple wounds, then you must apply poultice with wine or oil and put them over the locations
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if there is a time delay and the location of arrowhead injuries are rough skin, then you must apply poultice with wine or oil and put them over that location.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day is over, as we described before, then you must stop removing it and apply to its care what was done for him earlier until he has been healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore necessary based on the universal knowledge of treating arrowhead injuries.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 "On the other half of a second division [after 'half' is added for clarity], I say about every incision made by the surgeon in order to secure its end.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 About cuts on the scalp
Caput XLI.	 The 41st head
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 The incisions on the scalp are made by the surgeon and they appear to be of the type that secure the earpieces held in place by the hair; it seems as if these earpieces have been pulled out by chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 The species of those involved is many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among these are the earpieces that secure the hair with a damp cloth and hold it in place by the skin of the skull; among them is another type that holds the scalp tight to the skull by means of a hard plate; and there are others that do both, but they all use some other method for securing.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 In the course of the operation as a whole and with respect to their removal there is no fear that anything contrary to art will occur with respect to the veins which are fed by those arteries [veins].
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 The operation on their part is as follows: after the instrument with a certain form, which I call "the approach," has been introduced to examine it closely and find out what holds inside of it [i.e., within the incision].
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 If there is moisture that holds the instrument in place then you should remove it by a cut along its length and use this method of cutting along with the line of an initial incision, which is called "the approach.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the cut along the line B to the line G; when you remove the moisture you will find that something holds it in place and you do not leave any of its remains behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 Many things are left if anything is remaining from removing this
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse your hand into the Egyptian unguent if it is present; and if not then do so with water and salt; and you should cut through to its end until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 It will be destroyed by what remains from the cut.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then use the Egyptian unguent for the second and third time; if you grow weary of that then do so with water and salt until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the epiglottis is closed, then squeeze it according to this shape; with a cross-shaped hole and a pair of tongs: and pierce the vessels between the two sections, and excise him from all parts; and let your power be exerted in the extraction of the tunic that holds him.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 But if it makes you an artery, I will tell you about that afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do with the epiglottis if there is a stone present as well, remove it from the section and care for both of them together according to what we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The removal of the epiglottis is easier because there are few blood vessels and moisture present in it.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes there are epiglottis-like structures found in the head of some people where there is no moisture present.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I encountered an epiglottis on the tongue of a woman and pierced it like a solid stone, rough, white, that could not be scraped off; and if someone were to pierce him with something while he was being extracted, he would have been injured from doing so.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases the epiglottis may be injured through accidents on the head, except for these that happen to boys and at the roots of the ears; sectioning them all is a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or there may always be perforations in their lower part so that the discharge from the nasal cavity could go downwards to the lower parts of it.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 After this, treatment with him through his care after extraction.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Of the removal of the epiglottis from the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 Many of these epiglottis injuries occur on the neck and under the hyoids, and sometimes they happen throughout the body as well.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And those from which injuries occur on the neck are one and many; they are generated by the pharynx; all of them are within their own tunics as is in the epiglottis and in the head-endings, just like we mentioned before.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The species of harps are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 Among these there are stones; among these also are those that cause dampness; and among them too are those that are harmful, unyielding to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Among these there is a good disposition for handling, whose apparent proximity to the skin allows it to move over all of its part and not be attached with folds or guides; nor does it go deep into the body. It must be cut away from the upper part of the body along the line, then across that line, finally extending two lips outward towards both sides, as if one were taking out a finger through the ear lobes on each side at once and quickly removing it, just as in the case of the fingertips we said before; so remove this promptly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 It is necessary to be cautious that no injury occurs through carelessness or negligence.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Do not cut off your own hand with the incision, nor cause injury to a weak or sick person, nor remove anything that is not necessary for their treatment.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut off a limb or an artery and cause yourself to be unable to continue the treatment afterwards, you should make a cut in it so that some veins can release the blood, then bind up this vein, and loosen it later; otherwise, let it begin to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 Then take care of your own health after the treatment is over so that you do not bleed as a result.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Finally, with one finger pointing to other ear lobes if anything remains from the harps, then cut it off and dispose of it properly.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If the harp is located deep in a root and cuts it off from its own roots, you should cut it only with a doubled-twisted cord and remove it until it falls by itself without injury or damage.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Finally, loosen the older wound that you have already soaked with the Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Finally, take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 "When the stitches are cut through completely, it is necessary to apply a compress with two wounds on each side and immediately seal them up, as soon as you see that there were no further losses.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 "If you see that the strophule was too large and a portion of it remained after cutting through completely, then you should go back and try to make an incision at its root as well, and take out what is left. And apply the stitches we have mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 "If any of the strophules remained after they had been completely cut through with a small incision, perforate that and make it into a superficial opening so you can see where its center is located. And then put a stitch below this, just as we have mentioned.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 "Then apply a ligature with ointment to the strophule that remains after it has been perforated by a small incision, and also do this to its neighbors so they will corrode what was left from the corruption. Then when you see that the wound is healed, you should take care of it right away with the same process as before until it is completely healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 "From the epiglottis being dislodged from its place inside the throat due to an accident.
Caput XLIII.	 "Chapter 33, head.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 "The ancients made this incision into the epiglottis and did not find anyone within our territory who had done it: so these are their writings.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 "For those who have synechial membranes, it is necessary to make an incision into the epiglottis when there should not be a gap through that opening for fear of damaging both lungs.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 "For those who have a cold or sore throat, an incision into the epiglottis is necessary when there is no burning sensation coming out of their windpipe.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 "Therefore when we want to do this, let's make an incision into the epiglottis under three or four circles of it, depending on how big and wide that opening is between the two circles in terms of its quantity; so if you cut through cartilage there, but not through the strophula. And then that very place becomes visible because it is close to where the flesh was injured by the cutting, as well as the blood vessels being far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 When a surgeon is timid, he should stretch out his knife from the throat with caution.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 After cutting the skin, wait until it is ready to be pulled through (the canal), and if you see anything from them, do not hesitate; quickly withdraw your hand with blood on it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 After the incision is made (made on a channel), take note of it; its meaning is above the cut on the channel, when withdrawn from this and separated by cutting off, and making an opening with your voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 After a while you should open up the wound (if necessary).
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the time comes when one is fearful of the beginning (of surgery), gather together two lips from the skin and leave them alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 After this you should administer medicines that save birth wounds until they are healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 I have finished.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Here is the final part of my translation; please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I heard through you is that one of the assistants was performing a tracheotomy and inserting it into his throat.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 My breath was taken away from him, just as it is for one who is dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 I therefore took note of the wound and entered blood that had come out of it into his chest.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore, I was confused because she did not leave her wound unguarded and she went out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I then took care of my wound and him until he was healed; and the assistant did not do anything except for a little redness in her face and she returned after some days to better dispositions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 "Herein is explained that there should be no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Of the throat's hernia
Caput XLIIII.	 The head has 44 vertebrae.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This hernia of the throat is called "great" and it is large as to its color on the body; it is very common among women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It can occur either naturally or accidentally.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly not by nature.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The second one is similar to a knot on the beak of birds.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 The other way it occurs is by a knot in the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear in it; and it should not be that it cause a swelling with iron unless by its own nature; and you must try to probe it with an instrument (i.e., a tube or something similar), and examine it while inserting it, using it as an introduction into the body.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you encounter it similarly to a knot on the beak of birds and it is not tied up with any of the veins; then dry it out as they do for knots, such that when they are dried it may be taken out just like them: and if not, then search its entire length thoroughly.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 After treatment of the place with whatever is necessary for curing, until it has been cured.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Of the throat's nodes.
Caput XLV.	 The head has 45 vertebrae.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many nodes (or knots) of the throat; and I have already enumerated all their species one by one; and it is necessary that we indicate here a difference between the node and the exit in such a way that those who make doubt should see this.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore that when the exit is complete and the swelling has subsided due to the expulsion of excess fluids; at this point they remain in a state of weakness and fever.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 The node of the throat is not hot or cold, nor does it cause any pain; and they stay tied up as a knot on the body's color; and their opening is like that of a sack (i.e., round), and one way in which to approach them is from above downwards, and another way downwards towards the bottom: both big and small openings are possible.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 The two types of wounds are either puncture wounds (which may contain moisture) or open wounds that are contaminated with moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moisture are many according to what I said earlier.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 When you come to examine the node (of an organ), so that you can test it and ask about its first with a tool called Intramission, according to what is not its form here after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The way of asking about the nodes is general, so that you take this tool and enter it into a moist place; and then use your fingers with him for a while until you know that the tool has penetrated the wound.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then finally put down your hand according to the measurement of its magnitude.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then take away Intramission and consider what went out through his incision.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore the flowing moisture is red, whatever its color may be; then dry it with a superficial cut according to what I said earlier.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 If the flowing moisture does not go out through the incision of Intramission, then you know that it is a puncture wound; so dry this with a cross form having a deep cut according to its form, as I taught you: and hold him with your nails, and strip off the wound from all parts easily. And be cautious of the tool if you can, in order to take away this safe node along with Nodo.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the moisture in your tool is broken by surgery and you are not able to take away this safe node, then you will have to extract it with force until nothing remains of that thing.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If something remains from that thing or much, the nodes follow as many times.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If you are injured and there remains something from it; then you should use a tool with sharp corrosive ones for cutting off the wound: hold tight onto the wound, put on top of the cooled one that sits in the tool's mouth (the Intromission), care about him with the remaining care. Until he is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If there is a large knot on it then remove both of its lips and care for him as if he had been born
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If there is a pulsatile vein to you (which can be pulsating or non-pulsating), then remove it quickly with a sharp knife, and give him strict diet of two days, or three if the ulcer is not healed; until the pus comes out, and he lies still in ebullition. Then return to the incision which remained after the knot was removed.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Of instruments for section and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	 Head 66
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the forms of the introducers, and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 From these is the large one, from them is the medium size, and from them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let him fall downward to meet the extremities of the introducers, so that he may enter with a bang into the introducer who has received him.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 These are the forms of the experienced ones, and thus it is said that they pierce through or perforate; one of them is called a bore, namely piercing; there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these comes the large one, from them the medium size, and from them the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are joined together so that they may penetrate with a bang through the openings and the fistulas (abnormities where urine or feces come out), and bubbles from what is between them by the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And there are others which are rounded, flat, narrow (like a very small needle), of the type that is sharp on one end and blunt on the other; those ones pierce through the skin itself or through the flesh with their pointed ends, from this one in particular or that one in particular.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 The better of them are which come out through this one.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And there are the experienced ones of the black lead, who join so that they may penetrate through these fistulas which have a constriction, and with their flexibility they reflect as if in agreement with each other's movements.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 There are three types more.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because from these come the long fistulas, and then medium sized ones, and then small ones according to the quantity of the openings and their stricture (narrowness).
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 "The form and manner of treating many different types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 "While some are simple in their nature and have one treatment method; others three types of treatment.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 "And there is a form that has no cure for it, but three types of treatment.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 "And there are two forms that have two treatments each and three types of treatment each; and all these are necessary to be present.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 "These are the forms of scissors used for cutting and removing knots; and also for shaving.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 "The extremities of those tools are sharp and the others not sharp; they will not be used unless there is a small opening for use after shaving, or to cut off nails: so that any injured person may be treated with it, and bring back quietness more than from scratching due to the roughness.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 "These are scissors of three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 "They are like the scissors of the ears; when you blow into them they become a trumpet and make noise as if it were alcohol; but their point is hidden and curved inward and outward.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 "The form of the scissors that hides between fingers when used for shaving; they do not feel them as soft; and there are three types - great, middle, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 "The forms of the mouth when used for drawing blood; there are three types - great, middle, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 "They can be shaped like the ears or trumpet-shaped with an enlarged point at one end as long as you wish; and they are to be sharp.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 "You need to have those forms of the mouth with you and prepared for drawing blood when you are in a situation where there is no immediate medicine.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 "However do not use them in the drawing of blood everywhere on the body; but only in the places where it is hairy - for example on the arms, thighs, buttocks and breasts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 "And sometimes instruments are taken from them resembling fists of the size, and similar to the palm of the hand; on which blood is drawn when it flows from a vein or artery.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 "Of the care of human beings who are assimilated by women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 The 47th head
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 When the breasts of men are inflated with sleep (that is, when they become erect during sleep), until they resemble the breasts of women; and then remain embarrassed by shame after that feeding occurs.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Who therefore is disgusted by this, it is necessary that he hide behind the breast section, according to its shape from the line, D then go down to the line E; and finally, completely remove the embarrassment with a cure.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 After being exposed due to the incarnation of a doctor.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather two lips with sutures and care for him until he is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast falls downwards and becomes mollified by its own size, as happens with women: then it is necessary to find support in both his upper lips using two sections resembling a lunar shape, one of which is retained on each side at the ends so that there remains a line containing the smaller one, according to this form from the line, D then go down to the line E; and finally remove the swelling with sutures and powder it as we have mentioned in the cure for cuts.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you are not going to make a complete incision for him due to fear or the flow of blood: then it is necessary that he lie under a corrosive unguent and release him until the remaining swelling is burned away.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he is healed
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Regarding the perforations which occurred under Titillicus.
Caput XLVIII.	 The 48th head
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These are the wounds that occur beneath a titillus, they are hard and tough like thorns or spines of a hedgehog, from which come out those that are moistened by humidity.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore those that are moistened by humidity should be cut off with a lunar section, according to this shape, from line b to line g; and when it is completely drawn out of the wound beneath, then let him who made [it] apply an old cloth over his head up until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then he was dressed with a suitable ointment to heal it; and when it was healed
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the wound were from the spines of a hedgehog, then let them who made [it] shave off above it as described for shaving over the spines of an hedgehog.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If however a wound extends out so that it discharges pus, then administer to it a cautery as described for the discharge of pus when something was previously applied to it.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Of wounds caused by arteries and veins
Caput XLIX.	 The thirty-ninth part of the work.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When the artery is broken and the skin above it is consolidated, then many wounds occur beneath it; similarly they occur for veins as well, both of them causing the wound beneath to swell and inflate.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it can be known that wounds and swelling have occurred because of an artery or vein are as follows: for when there is a wound beneath from an artery then it is long, extended into the depths of the body; and when you give a blow to your finger on its way out, you feel as if he is struggling.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which occurs because of a vein is round upon the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And the section over this wound is an error, and especially beneath the scales and gills, and neck, and in many parts of the body; it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore let it be treated with care using iron, and anything that came from them beneath as well, whether on the extremities or head should also be treated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 The condition being examined is due to a narrowing of the arteries from their openings
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 After examining the section with the needles, then release the artery and allow it to be released from the clothing until it is identified.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 After inserting it under the point, then make it penetrate until another point on a different side of its length and tie off the artery with two separate knots, as you have learned in extracting both arteries from the wrists.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 After puncturing the location between the two bands with a spatula and allowing all of its contents to drain away until it is entirely empty and then seal off the aperture.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 After administering a treatment that generates pus until the bands fall away and then care for it with suitable ointments to this extent, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the aperture was due to a cut in a vein then you should hold tightly with your hand as it is possible for you to do so from the opening while holding it securely with needles or thread.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 After inserting the needle under where you held your hand tightly and make it penetrate into that area with a double thread until it is pulled out from another side of its length.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 After tying the artery with good cord as you were taught by me using two parts of thread and two extremities, respectively.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If however you remove the thread then insert a needle with another one under the opening completely on the incision and tie your thread into four parts.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 After drying off the opening and when it is ready then you make an incision through its contents and remove what was bound by it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 After placing a small stick that you soaked in oil on top of it while submerged in the wine.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 After administering the treatment with liquids and ointments until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 The condition that occurred due to the tearing of the nerves
Caput L.	 The head of L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 "Like an arrow that struck the artery and vein, similarly it strikes a nerve; for it is when it hits them (the nerves), or due to excess exertion, [or] from similar causes: so many injuries occur in the hands of those who perform sutures, whether in their fingers or at other places where stitches are made. And thus bruises abound.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 "His likeness is seen in the body of many people, and he has no sensation without pain; when he is stretched by excessive strength, he falls into a similar swoon.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 "He is not an arrow accumulated deep within the body, and he falls under a stroke; and he is moved to every part of it, but not to the front or back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 "Therefore, what comes from them should be applied with the hand rather than a weapon.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 "If it is twisted.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 "But if from them comes to the head or front, find a stroke with a whip.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 "If it is a small arrow, hold him tight with fingers and pull him away from his root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "If it is a great arrow, suspend him with a cord and tear him apart; then collect him, treat him, until he becomes whole.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 "On the treatment of arrows.
Caput LI.	 "Chapter 1
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 "Many people are injured by arrows of their own kind.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 "From whose root is small and from whose head is large; the lips vary in them.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 "They are also of a lesser kind, or more powerful kind.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 "And I heard of a man whose arrows were two; they were more like the things mentioned before than any other similar thing.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 "I therefore cut off one of them and make an incision on the other as if it were half a Roman ounce (eight times a fraction), then perform the operation with an incision into both of them.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 "Since there is much blood at his section, therefore if the one who performed the incision bleeds, then cauterize him immediately.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 "If you see an infirm person trembling from the incision with a needle, then take a thread made of lead and make it dangle downwards; after that tie it to his arm according to the method we have mentioned, and release him in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 "Then add lead poisoning to his stricture.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 "Therefore do not tie the lead, since it can still be removed and die without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 "If there is a large tumor on his incision then it was with some fear and weakness; especially that which is inside the groin.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it may be possible to remove the obstruction from him gently.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 "Then cauterize him so that he does not die.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 "Then take care of him until the ulcer is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 "And remember that you should not perform an incision on the one whose skin is swollen and has a bad smell; it is indeed an ulcer with pus discharge from the cancer, and I will remind you of this after some time.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 "Take care of the disease of Vmbilicus.
Caput LII.	 The second head
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 The illness of Vmbilicus came from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 "Or it may come from a fissure on his back; and then he would die after the intestines were burst, or if it came from the intestine.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 "Or from blood which flowed out of a vein, or from an artery according to what was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 "Or it may come from the hardening of the veins inside him.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 "If it is due to a cut on the finger, its exit will be upward; then the color of the wound resembles that of the body; and there is no pain; and the place appears different.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 "If it's due to an exit of intestines, then its location is as described above.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 "When you grasp it with your fingers, it is covered; then comes back, and it may cause a sound like a bell; and the work of it will be done with great effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 "If it is due to moisture, there is no pain; when you grasp it with your hand, nothing happens except for the covering.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 "If it is due to blood, then with these signs appear a red spot on the back of your hand.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 "If it is due to the fat from the liver; then there will be a blue spot, large, moist, and it will appear according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 "If it's due to heat, then touching it is light (not painful).
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 "The operation is done on it as long as you consider that the prominence of the abdomen was due to either blood in arteries or veins, or heat; then you have to stop the treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 "In it there was fear and weakness like I saw them in the chapter where I described wounds due to arteries or veins.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 "If the prominence of the abdomen was due to intestines or a wound; then you have to make sure that the person is lying down and not moving.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 After placing it around the belly, place signs with wax all around.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 "After that, press on its surface between your hands to lift him up onto his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 "Then, after placing the signs with wax all around; put it down over where you placed it.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 After that, extend the middle of the wound towards above and put a large bandage on top.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 In a strong grip with cord and firmly against bone, or tightly against chord of the sternocleidomastoid muscle: then set the knot in the relaxed position.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 After securing it to the sternocleidomastoid muscle as mentioned above, gently pull the lower eyelid upwards and outwards towards the nose with a finger or thumb.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If the eyelid is now firmly held by the cord, then remove it from its position and introduce a finger into it; move the stomach towards the interior of the body while grasping an excess amount with your thumb: if the eye is still held in place using only one hand, grasp it gently and strike against the other hand's knuckles.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If there are any arteries or veins around, then make a complete circle with it (i.e., encircle all of them).
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 After that, return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two strong needles; tie them into a double knot with their ends as if they were crossing each other at the base of the eyelid and then force them through to make an X-like shape.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 After that, tie the eyelid to four places above one of the needles; if necessary, remove and loosen the other needle and release its place until it becomes long and falls on itself or breaks apart.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to him with whatever oil is required until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the prominence of the belly button protrudes from his flesh or moisture, then it is necessary that you tie him to the eyelid as we mentioned earlier.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And remove blood or moisture which may be present within him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then attend to him with whatever support is necessary until his position is fixed.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 The end of the treatment, as mentioned earlier.
Caput LIII.	 End of text
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We mentioned earlier the use of species (surgical instruments) for Cancers and how they were used to care for him with medicines; we also warned that one must be careful not to injure or ulcerate him while using iron tools during his treatment. And, in addition, we specified where the cancerous growth was produced from within the matrix and recommended taking precautions when caring for it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 When a tumor occurs where it can be removed, like a tumor in the breast or thigh, and others of its kind from limbs attached for removal, especially when it begins small
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 Unless it is very large, it should not be cut off
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 I was unable to cure someone from that
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as we said, is done so as to be able, and only one who has been seized with cholera will fail.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Afterwards, you must remove all of its blood vessels along with the filling
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 After that, you prepare yourself to perform the treatment (surgery).
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Afterwards, you must remove all of it's vessels which are attached to it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Afterwards, you must remove it completely from all sides along with the blood vessels according to your treatment until nothing remains of its roots: and release its blood flow, do not cut off or tear it apart, I swear by the location where there is a possibility for removal using instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however, the blood flow of its large vessel is obstructed by cutting into an artery or vein, then cauterize that one until it stops flowing blood.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards, you must perform your treatment on it along with the remaining care until it is cured.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 The cure of hydropisis.
Caput LIIII.	 End
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We are treating hydropisis by this mixture of water and signs (symbols), just as the combination is formed when mixing together water with its own characteristics, and care for it along with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is cured by iron is only the sign of scabies alone: and cannot be combined with the iron of tympanitis, nor can it be combined with the iron of hypo-scarcity, for this would be fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you are cured already by this symptom of hydropisis and tympanitis along with medicines, and your treatment did not work: then consider it carefully.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 "If the patient is already weakened or has another illness in addition to Hydropism, then as it would be if he were a sieve with water flowing through him; so that when he drinks, either of these things will happen: either his strength will return and he'll get better, or on the contrary, his condition will deteriorate further. But if you give him iron at this time, because of fear for what might come to pass.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 "If you notice a patient who is already very weak and has no other ailment besides Hydropism, it's not that he is getting worse due to the additional affliction; nor yet an infant or old person: so at this point in his condition there must be a mode of treatment which I will tell you now. You shall draw him into your hands as if you were holding out one hand and supporting him with the other, then pour water gently down his throat from above downwards.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 "Afterwards take it slowly and carefully by this way.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 The two parts are acute, long, and narrow like a sieve.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 "However there must be some slight weakness present so that you won't pass through it until the operation is complete and afterwards.
Deinde considera.	 Afterwards consider
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 "If the generation of Hydropism comes from a part of the intestines, then you must extend it with three fingers' length upwards and downwards above his throat.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 "If the generation of Hydropism comes due to exhaustion from outside, then you must make a section with your left hand and extend it three fingers upwards.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 "And if the generation of him is due to weakness on one side, then you must make a section in the right side and do not let there be made another cut into the weakened place lest it flows out more than needed.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 "Then make an incision with your whole instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 "Then insert into the incision and take your thumb with a sieve between the incision, and push it gently as if you were squeezing him; and let there be applied the quantity of that which is being removed equal to the length of a finger or in such manner around.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 "Then pierce the vein, let it run out into space until there is a vacuum; and that spot will be water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 "After piercing, remove it out and put [it] into the opening/foramen of an instrument whose shape this is.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 "And it is similar to a tube of metal or air or ear trumpet; there are three openings on the side opposite from where the vein comes out and two on each side near that opening/foramen, one at an angle to the other - thus its end was cut off in the manner of a razor blade as you see: above it is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 "When the instrument pierces through to water then that water descends immediately over/upon the instrument; therefore half a measure of water is extracted at once.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 "If the water is extracted from it more than necessary then either the sick person will die at once through a failure of his vital spirits, or he will have convulsions which approach death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 "Indeed the water is extracted from it according to its power and how much strength he has; also considering that you know his dispositions when you feel his pulse with kindness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 "After removing the instrument hold onto/retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 "This is because you must hold onto/retain it quickly due to the cut that retains the vein where it comes out; from which I will tell you how to pierce it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 "The following day if you are able to tolerate the instrument then remove and also extract half a measure of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 "Do this on several days without fear or worry until all but half the water is not left over/remaining from the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 "If the sick person is worse and you have removed a large amount of water then care for him with cold water baths, sweat much on hot days, expectorate from his chest, wash over/upon him [with] wet clothes after removing it; according to what I told you in that instrument.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 The care of infants born in a place where they are not pierced
Caput LV.	 head
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When I examine a newborn infant from its mother's womb, and the child's head is not pierced (or has a narrow or blocked hole), either because it was not born through the birth canal, or there is something wrong with that place
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore I suggest to apply a small piece of wire (sputumuli) immediately upon birth in order to remove any obstruction and ensure smooth passage.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a small clamp made from lead (cluum), bind it tightly, hold it in place for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 After urination is emitted, remove the clot and urine remains.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then release him.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 If you don't put lead, it is still possible for the urine that flows over the place not to allow the clot to form.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 The one whose hole is narrow must be treated with lead as we described, for many days until it becomes wider.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those who have the hole not at their place are to be treated.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 That is because when they are born the hole of their head ends in the neck of the veins (or in some sources, the hole ends at the top of the neck). And so it cannot empty itself to its own, until it has released the hand with its own towards its upper side.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Neither is generation there, because semen cannot penetrate into the mother's body in accordance with nature; and therefore, there is foetal distress from lead.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the way of treatment/operation in this case is to support his back up
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend his head towards the left hand of you and cut off the top of veins from its place by a sharp tool (sutumuli or spatumili), so as to remove obstruction, ensuring smooth passage like an incision with a knife would do, except this is done with the fingers rather than a blade. And then bring it to the middle in accordance with what is appropriate.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 It's important that you are there at the time of his blood flow
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 "Many times does it happen that this occurs.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, if he cuts through the artery with his instrument and causes a wound to bleed out, until he is cured.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 The things that occur through the instrument and the cutting of the vein, corruption, negligence, and the letting go.
Caput LVI.	 Section VI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Many times occur these things to Albucasis with the instrument, and a great swelling of the muscle occurs.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this other things are bad as well as good.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore it is necessary to suspend with a subtle hook and let go of her, until all the world has taken her entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then he puts himself under an Egyptian ointment on top of her.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Therefore the care is with him after this thing and the ointment for healing, until he is cured.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If Albucasis is bad as a color, then it is necessary that you administer to her cautery after the cutting of his and hers reasons.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If Albucasis is captured through the instrument and is not circumcised, then a part of Albucasis between capture and another part outside it is necessary that you take Albucasis who is inside first until he consolidates; thereafter care for him externally because when you cure her simultaneously, it does not secure the capture which precedes.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And also occur these things to Albucasis on testicles as well, and corruption occurs from capture and negligence
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore it is necessary that you tie up everything which has already been corrupted as well as what he wants to corrupt or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then you put a line on top of him after this with the earth which has been tied up previously with flour for grinding grains and herbs as well as threshing weeds.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore care is with it along with the remaining care until he is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If Albucasis cuts through an artery then administer cautery together with lunar cautery in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 Cautery is a tool used in two different ways simultaneously, one being to control bleeding and the other when a wound becomes infected
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head is pierced by a sword and destroyed completely at once, then you must immediately apply pressure to the wound with a clamp from a lead weight so that it may be held firmly against her.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 If the blow struck on the head or upper part of the body and did not result in death (as it would if a fatal blow), unless the victim was wearing armor that protected him from such an injury; then when this happens, you must immediately apply pressure to the wound with a thumb cramp from iron, so as to hold it firmly against her.  If the blow struck on the lower part of the body or the hand and did not result in death (as it would if a fatal blow), unless the victim was wearing armor that protected him from such an injury; then when this happens, you must first apply pressure with your thumb cramp to hold it closed against her.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If discerning who struck the blow is difficult due to the head being covered or obscured in some way, then you must apply pressure with your thumb cramp on the hand from the shield side, as well as against her head/face.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 This is because when someone wields a sword with great subtlety, there's a risk they may inadvertently strike the opponent in such a way that it pierces their armor or strikes a weak point of the body
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Afterwards remove both your thumb cramp from the shield and the hand from the face with a linen bandage soaked in cold water so that they don't stick to each other anymore.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 After this you will treat him with wine or some other beverage until he regains consciousness.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 For the sake of education and the care of them so that they don't make mistakes.
Caput LVII.	 Title 72
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuality like other wounds; however since it comes from our own action and use, they wish that we teach them how this procedure can be done better and safer so as to save their lives.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore I say that ancient authors did not write about circumcision in any of their books; because it is not used according to their laws and is only something we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 To cut is because I have made the greater part of my art and phlebotomists' work more effective by making incisions with a blade or other instrument around a wound while holding it closed with forceps; so that they are opened up, ligated with thread, and incised with a knife.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I have also tested all these methods but was not able to improve the work of phlebotomists more effectively with forceps and thread ligation.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because when making incisions around a wound while holding it closed with a blade or other instrument, too much skin was removed.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 There are two layers of skin; therefore one must make a transverse incision into the upper layer and leave the lower layer intact so that an additional incision can be made for further treatment and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when making incisions with the aid of fingerstiffs (also called suture needles), that is to say, those used by surgeons, it is not ensured that the incision at the end of the wrist will be made without injury; for fear may occur from piercing its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However when making incisions with a knife (or other instruments like scalpels), there is sometimes the risk of staining your operation and causing children's skin to become pale due to its nature, which often leads to such injuries; I have already heard about this occurrence.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The experiments with forceps and thread were good for me as the incisions made by them are proportional; therefore because the higher acuity is like that of the lower acuity.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore when you use both hands to make the incision and they are proportioned according to one operation at a time; and there is made a similar compression that holds back the skin from all sides while no mistake occurs in any part of it.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 The method of the operation itself is as follows; to extimate the boy especially if you can learn from those who are more skilled than you, that is unless you ligate thread only into its own hole and then release it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him enjoy life in all ways possible through what he has received from his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 "Then place it between your raised hands and let it not lie down; secretly open the fingers of your hand or under your foot so that no one else may see them, except by means of an instrument.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 "Then take hold of his arm with your hand and apply the bandage around it tightly so that when you pull him up he will be freed from the wound.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 "Then cleanse the same thing which has been collected into this bandage by means of a tube (lit., 'sordice' - a small, thin tube).
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 "Then tie it with double cord.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 "Then tighten the lower part of it more than its upper part.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 "Hold on with your thumb and forefinger; secure the lower ligature firmly while holding both ends of it tightly together in between.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 "Then apply pressure to the wound or you may lift him up by his arm and out of the bandage.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then gently run the blood for a short time and remove some of the excess fat; cover it with another bandage which has been soaked in boiled water, vinegar, and oil, and secure this bandaged part to that above it until you are free from care.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 "The shape is formed so as to facilitate the cleansing of these things which have been collected into a bandage by means of tubes (lit., 'sordice' - a small, thin tube).
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 "There should be two fingers and they are bent; so that the length of both of them may be equal to the length of their corresponding hands.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 "A mistake occurs during the cleansing when some skin is torn off completely or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 "Therefore you should push her out when your thumb is on and before the application of the ligature; cut it off in equal parts.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 "If you are unable to hold her with your thumb, then pull her out quickly using a finger and cut it off.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 "If three days have passed and there is still swelling under the bandage; then release it so that cold may come upon the wound, loosen it gently with oil and cut it off in accordance to what has been prepared for you.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 "It shall not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 "Therefore let the surgeon proceed with him as he heals a wound inflicted by cutting above the line of measurement, and let it go to the top if the cut is made that way; but still do not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore proceed with him as you said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 "Of the retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Eighty-eighth head.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder is treated by removal from stone, or cold blood, or pus, or formed flesh; and just as you have provided remedies for these methods of curing in another part
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the bladder stone cannot be removed and you believe that his retention is caused by it, then he should lie down on his knees to cure him.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then both of his feet should be placed on his back and the upper part of his back should be stretched out to stretch as much as possible his longing for healing.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 He will then proceed with the bladder stone towards its removal from behind, because the retention was resolved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If not resolved as he had said and the bladder stone is still a problem for him, then you should proceed to administer its removal with an instrument called siringa, which has this form; it is long like a pen's tube but slenderer than one palm, smooth, and made of such fine steel that needles could be drawn from it.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The mode of exiting the bladder through him is like taking hold of a double thread and tightening it at both ends to make a knot; then inserting one end into an inferior part of the siringa and cutting off with fingers if anything comes from the wool as you would do when you are weaving, but you should put it in the cannula just as before.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then with oil or butter and white wax; make the bed of the patient comfortable, and bind up his bladder; then you should wash him with olive oil from above downward, or with butter, or with almond water; warm the water gently.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 "Next, place the instrument gently on top of the vein with ease and let it pierce its root.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 "Place both ends on either side of the vein
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 "Next, press the instrument firmly into the vein so it pierces its root and feels for the artery, and if found, gently guides it to this, aiming at the matter, which is not according to this order unless there is a special reason why that particular point is good because it has a lot of tortuousness.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 "Finally spread out the thread with gentle care
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 "The vein follows the thread.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 "Next remove the vein and lead it through a narrow channel for hunting (hunting the arrow), repeating this until you have found the vein and let the instrument gently pierce its vein.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 "The quality of the instrument must be tested with the clepsydra
Caput LIX.	 "The head of 39.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 "When the instrument pierces a vein and there is bleeding or clotting of its contents, then gather together water and medicine to treat it with that which is called clepsydra (a device used for measuring out drops), so this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 "It is silent
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 "There are three holes (the artery and two veins), one on each side of the vein.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 "The place where the thing pulls is measured according to the amount it exerts without addition (the quantity of drops), until something is drawn with it from dampness; and when it pushes out, with it pushed back to long ago: as clepsydra measures out the flow, that is, Greek fire in the face of men at arms.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 "So when you want to apply moisture to the vein, put its extremity into the moisture and draw it with what pulls up to the top: for the moisture is drawn into the cavity of clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert his extremity between the thumb and the little finger
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 After that, he applies moisture with him as what moved her to come quickly and immediately she felt wet.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 With a soft sponge like this the sponge is made wet.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be of silver or gold, whose head is larger than an egg and has a notch under it to hold the nose?
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the sponge to the fingertips, put moisture into it, with which you wet the sponge.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 After that tie the sponge between two strong stitches using a double thread, and heat the moisture more than oil.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then put the extremity of the sponge between your thumb and little finger, then tie a strong thread with moisture on it and when he feels wet, that's already wet.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If you do not have a sponge at hand, then take the remnant of parchment paper and make a circle with it, and perforate it from all of its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 After that tie the strong thread between them like how they go together.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then you wrap it around, just as the rope is wrapped by oil and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it to an instrument and do with it like you did with the sponge using your hand, until the moisture is added to the sponge.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 From the extraction of parchment
Caput LX.	 Head 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said about the use of parchment, and its care with medicines: and I have mentioned a difference between those made by artists for writing or sewing, and others used only as a sponge; and I have spoken of the signs on it in general terms, and I spoke of the parchment where the operation is performed using the hand and cutting. And thus we have said about the generation of the parchment itself: and this was done with an open display and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 "Therefore I say that the stone generated from water has caused most harm to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 "And from these signs it comes that urine is generated by water similar to how water is in its subtlety and appears as a white foam on the water's surface; when it strikes, it makes the man with whom it had intercourse weak, and hard at work, and often drops.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 "Then afterwards arises, urine from it, as a result of which many people become ill.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 "The healing of children is easy, resulting in some cases even up to 14 years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 "And it is difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 "In children itself there is a medium degree; it is that which is between the two extremes and whose lapis (stone) is greater in size - its care is easier; if small, then his care is cheaper.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 "Since therefore we come to the care of children, it is first necessary, so that we can cleanse them with the help of a cloth; for this reason he sometimes prohibits the stone from being inserted into their bowels during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 "Then the patient is taken with his own feet and moves towards the lower end; so that the stone descends into the water's depths or comes up in some cases from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 "Then they make him sit between your hands and set his feet beneath the crossbar of their bench; so that all the water may be directed downward towards the lower end.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 "Then question him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 "If therefore you hear the stone as a space, then immediately apply the cutting instrument to it above and cut off the stone.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 "If it does not fall under your touch at all times, then you should remove the finger indicating a thumb from the left hand if the patient is a child; or use the middle finger if he is an adult and insert him into his anus, and question about the stone until it lies below your finger.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 "Then press with your finger and pull it outward to the external part of its section, wherewith you will open an incision; and then take hold of the minister with one hand, that you may apply your knife with another, and strike downward on the testicle with your left hand, which lies beneath in the part from whence it is cut.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 "Then introduce a blunt instrument into its section, whose shape this is.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 "And find within it what lies between the testicle and anus, but not in its middle; make an incision on the left side from anus to testicle; then strike downward upon it with a stone; your finger should be inserted into its opening; let there be two incisions made one above and one below, according to the quantity of stones that can be extracted downwards without injury.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 "If you press too hard with your finger into the opening of the stone near its section and it slips out easily without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 "You know that from a stone there are angles and margins, for the exit of him is difficult because of those things.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 "And from it there comes easily, similar to a glans penis, and round; and an easy exit for them.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 "Therefore, add the incision with those angles and margins.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 "If it doesn't slip out that way, then you should press upon its head; or tie it with your hands in a downward motion towards him, the extremity being like to the moon, which holds up to the stone and does not withdraw from it; or introduce some delicate instrument beneath it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 "If you cannot press upon its head, then make a wider opening in front of it.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 "If something comes from the blood, let go of him with your mouth.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 "If a stone is more than one, then you must first press it into the female's vagina as much as possible.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 "Then strike upon him above.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 "Then press the others in turn, just as if there were two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 "If one's knowledge is great, ignorance ensues when he separates a large part from it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 "When one has fallen ill with two causes or is destined to die of both, the stream of urine will be impeded by a strong flow of urine.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 "Indeed, when one is expelled from office or has fallen apart along with its parts, he will be removed outside of his place.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 "Once you have completed your operation, the wound will be healed with honey and aloe; also with dragon's blood; tie him down and lay a warm blanket over him, pour olive oil or wine upon him as it pleases you; also cold water to cool his burning flesh.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 "Then the patient lies on top of his chest and is not supported by a single ligature until after three days have passed.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 "Once he has been bound up, cover him with water and olive oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 "Then care for him with the unguent of Daphne and Basil until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 "If he is burned by the hot ashes of a victim and becomes corroded; or if his flesh freezes from being exposed to cold water and urine cannot escape out of him until he knows it through the egress of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 "Therefore put your finger into the wound and remove his blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 "If this remains, he will become corrupted with urine and decay.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 "Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; bind him to everything that was used in his care until he is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 "It should be done throughout the course of treatment as long as two attendants are needed and all the equipment placed upon it.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 "If a stone is flat and lies on the ground near water; if it is moved by that, urine cannot escape from it; then care must be taken of him with what he knows before dividing.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 Many thanks for excusing me from this examination, I have already tried that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 It is as follows: the instrument of perforation with a sharp point, whose shape is triangular at the ends and fixed to wood
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a rope and tie it around a stone so that it does not slip off easily.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then introduce the perforator with ease into your hand so that it penetrates to the stone quickly, and return the perforator by using only one's own hand in the stone gently, until you make this perforator penetrate both ends of another part: then do you accomplish this perforation.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Urine will have been excreted immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then take your hand over the remaining part of the rope that slipped off from outside
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 This one is broken and returns with urine, and heals any illness.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this examination is not prepared for you due to something that prohibits it from doing so, then tie the rope under the stone and another above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then dry over the stone between two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After this, make the frozen blood thaw and free from the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 It is not necessary to tie the rope under the stone unless it does not slip off easily: and another above, unless when you have tied up the rope after escaping from stones, it slips back into its own place, and cooperates with the wound; and for this reason, if you tie the upper part of the rope, so that the skin is returned to its superior position, and cooperates with the wound just as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 From the extraction of women's buttocks.
Caput LXI.	 The end of book 11
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Nothing is generated from a woman by a stone.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If you meet one of these stones then it is difficult treatment and forbidden because of many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 "The strength of a woman is greater than that of a man.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 Secondly, because a woman who has taken upon herself to be treated as a physician when she is pure and/or married to a medical practitioner.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you do not treat a wise woman well in this art (surgery), especially when she is performing the task with her own hands.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, there are stones of the deep pool that require sections because it is dangerous; and this is the fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If a need arises to do so, then you should take on that woman who is wise and skilled as a physician; only she will be of use.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you want to ask a doctor of medicine and subtlety (a skilled physician), or a woman who has undertaken some part of the art of women's healing; take on that present woman who is wise, skilled, and well-versed in this field, as she will be able to perform everything necessary for her from an inquiry over stones.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, if you want to know whether a woman is married or not: then it is necessary for her hand to be put into his mouth and he should ask the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If you have received him beneath your own finger and he has asked the stone after being placed over her weakened side; having set his left hand upon her chest and pressed upon her with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If you have received the stone beneath her chest and she has moved him with all of her strength downwards towards her lower abdomen; having then pressed upon his head so that he would move his whole body upwards to meet the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Afterwards she should place him beneath the pelvis with medium-sized obstacles on his path to the root of the pelvis; from wherever part he is brought out and feels it into that part; and her fingers do not move away from the stone, but hold onto him under him until a section is made first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Afterwards she should enter the womb for performing an operation on her.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If a stone was felt by touch, then he would place it in the incision secondarily based on its proportional measurement to which it is reduced from that
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 There are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From him there arises a small one and a large one, a soft one and a rough one, long ones and rounded ones having hair.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore you know the kinds of it so that it is understood by this in regard to what follows.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood flows into you then apply a tourniquet immediately and hold it tightly for one hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Afterwards you are to proceed with your operation until the stone is removed and do as I instructed for holding a stone in the veins so that you may assist through it during your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If blood flows into you then know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which was cut and place a pad over it tightly and tie it with cord securely not to let go: and release the stone do not remove him.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 For fear may death come upon the weak woman
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Afterwards care for her
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the heat of blood is after days and putrefaction arises then proceed with your operation until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Of the incision above the hernia.
Caput LXII.	 The 62nd chapter.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 An egg is not called a siphon unless the collection of moisture in its base is white and is under the control of the scrotum testicles which it covers and is called siphon.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is located inside the scrotum by itself which nature prepared for him in part therefore until it puts on that which is different and its skin between the siphon white as I said and he does not do this except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 The generation of these rams is from weakness that has struck the testicles and therefore leads to them this matter.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 Sometimes there is a bruise from above the testicles
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 This causes much dampness
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 The blood may turn reddish, or it might be a bruise caused by feces, or it could be a greenish one, white or black, depending on the cause of its color
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 Signs which indicate where there is an aggregation of water are these ones.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 If it is a scrotal abscess as we mentioned earlier, then an opening will be made in the shape of an oval extending in length somewhat like that of an 'O', and you won't see the testicles because the dampness will cover them completely.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 If there is dampness only on its own part, then the opening will be round with a portion of it projecting out like an 'O', and this is because something else exists.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 If there's dampness between the scrotum and the testicles but white in color, then it falls under the foreskin.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When you consider the color of dampness, if there is an opening between the scrotum and the testicles that causes this, then it will show as a square-shaped opening whose shape comes before it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that, if you consider the scrotum and testicle being inside each other as a reference point, what must be considered is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the treatment with a tool like an iron, it is necessary for you to remove as much of this as possible by using phlebotomies if that can be done, and also make sure his body is filled up fully.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then it will be placed on top of his back over another part to some extent, and he must put a lot of padding under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you should sit on the left side of him and prepare to place your hand gently as it sits down towards his right side while extending your arm so that it is touching both sides of the scrotal area, and also make a gesture with one of its parts towards the inside.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a narrow strip of cloth and run it from the middle downwards to near the scrotum, so that you make a cut along an equally straight line which follows the scrotal area until it reaches under the foreskin; then remove this one piece and observe or examine it in order to see if you can separate it: but also take another piece of cloth with your left hand from the part that is hanging out more, and scrutinize it carefully while using excision according to how much you are able.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 "Remove completely a large piece of flesh from its blood supply by making a hole in it and then withdraw all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 "Cut between the two lips sections with a hook and extend the flesh to its superior position, but do not cut through the testes that are comprehended: And make an incision in the place where you can cut it, either completely or partially according to your preference.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 "If you do not carefully examine it before making the incision, then there will be no security for its water when removed.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 "If you proceed to cut off your own flesh outside the time of your operation, then immediately after having completed the incision remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 "After that, gather up both lips with a stitch and the testes.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of it as you would of any other wound to make sure it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 "If there is a risk that your own flesh might be corrupted due to negligence or other reasons; then it is necessary for you to use the veins which are safeguards and protectors of the flowing blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 "After that remove the testes with a stitch and then take care of it as you have described in previous instructions.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 "If the water is gathered into two parts; then you know that there are two veins. Therefore dry out one half just as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 "If both of them become equal to each other; then make your operation into one piece and afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 "And if the flesh is submerged in oil or a mixture of different oils; then put one of them into oil that you have previously used and expand it above two testes [testicles], and place the other over the same spot as before, on top of two folds and there are bristles: And tie them together with a thread which holds six in this manner.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 "After that are gathered up two pieces of cloth and the one is put on with a stitch; as for this similarity: And the extremities to which it [the cloth] reaches are brought together above the buttocks from one side, and they are brought together below the other side by the same thread.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 Upon occasion and artificially applying this ramekin with caution to the affected area using a knife: it is as if you are burning (or cutting) the gauze in order to remove blood from an abscess containing water; until when the abscess is taken out of its contents, then take the ramekin by that shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 Greek letters were assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 After taking the ramekin by that form and applying it to the affected area, it is as if you are pouring (or dripping) water onto an abscess until all its moisture has been burned off.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 After taking the ramekin by that form and applying it to the affected area while holding it with a small, burning knife, you should cut into (or slice) it until all of its moisture has been burned off.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And cover it with your hand so that it doesn't burn the patient's skin.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 You know this procedure is more advantageous than one involving bleeding and better still than surgical procedures.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If a contraindication arises at the time of bleeding or burning, or at the application of cold water, or from another source: in that case you should apply something which counters the contradiction by using what you have with care to counteract it according to how it was given.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If the patient is timid and does not anticipate this procedure due to its terrifying nature: in that case administer a hole according to what I mentioned earlier, and it's done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are informed by me of the meaning of that ramekin which is made of water and its purpose: in that case it is necessary to place a bedpan over an elevated seat so that the patient can sit on it.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 After placing a small hole at the bottom of its side with a small slit, make an opening according to the length of the body and be wide enough so that all the water can flow out freely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 After placing it on a bedpan and tying its top securely so that the water can flow out freely, you should attend to it for treatment until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If there is a difference between the flow of water during withdrawal and the time of perforation, that is to say when you withdraw it, then do not let anything else occur except for this reason, because the white sheet (panniculus) creates an opposition in the exit hole and prevents the outflow of water; therefore at that point you must insert a straw into the fistula or use an instrument with which water can be extracted from hydropics.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 It is known that water returns after six months, or in a circular manner around them
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore it is added at this point as before, and the sick person will pass away within seven days
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Of the cure of the flesh wound.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter 63
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 It is known that the flesh wound will suffer from a fear of death multiplied by many factors.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 You must be released him free from his fears of death as a result of this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am a reminder of the surgery on that day and the signs of the disease.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore I tell you that there are many signs on bodies from which testicles are formed; and this occurs as a result of these causes.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or through the sudden or sharp abundance of fluids, which flows into the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or by a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the signs of disease are according to the color of the body and do not feel pain for him; but they have a greyish appearance.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Or there may be a stone sign, whose color is dark and does not sense to them.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 Or sometimes it happens through a knot in the arteries or their swelling; as I have mentioned before to you; or from an excess of urine.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore it is from them through the compression of their signs when you compress with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 Do not let anything touch it earlier.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 That is to say that nothing can escape from the urine swelling when you compress with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 "And it is possible that a section should be made over this part and above the rest of the meat; and there is to cut off the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 "Then stretch us upwards and remove the skin with a knife; and free the suspender from inside, and tie it up; and cut off the suspender when you have freed it from all parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 "If our hands are tied with the flesh of any animal, then let us take hold and cut off that thing.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 "If there is an obstacle between something and the rope or inside it; then you must let go of all that, and cut off that thing with a round knife.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 "If there is no life left on the part of the obstacle that is behind; then let you cut off all of it and take hold again as we mentioned.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "When your work is done then you should wash the incision with wool soaked in sweet oil and vinegar; after that take care of it with what remains of the curing until it is cured.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 "Of the cure for testicles which is with semen.
Caput LXIIII.	 The end.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 "The testicles have been softened by a certain softening, similar to that of the horse, with a cure for them; and it is difficult movement from being sick or tired, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 "And there is fear of this because the one whose remembrance precedes has preceded a thing.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 "The truth is that we should say what they did at the beginning as far as possible.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 "Therefore I am saying that it would be best to let a sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 "Then pull the suspender of testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 "Then hold the skin of testicles with your fingers and keep them near to the body; let another person take it in turn, and then stretch it out smoothly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 "Then cut off with a sharp, curved knife the suspenders as far as they are pulled up; until they are drawn out.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 In the meantime remove everything from every part
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Next, you will tie a second knot (a figure-eight knot) around the part where there is a doubled piece of string, and then tie it at the first places from which the arteries come out. And then finally tie another one as you did before for those that come last.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Afterwards, cut through the middle of each part along its length and remove any pieces from sweat or other bodily fluids that may be rotten or spoiled.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Afterwards, you should cure the ulcers with treatment of their sores, which can generate semen and thus bring death to those that feed upon one member.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not a bad thing.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If all the veins are damaged from that, then it should be done so that those testes with wounds can be removed for food, due to cutting and bleeding, or drying up and rotting; and not be eaten by them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 The cure of the intestines of the rams.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The removal of the ram's intestines is done by cutting through a slit that goes from behind to before on the inner side of the tail part inward toward the anus.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Therefore, they fall out of the rupture towards one member.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture can be from a slit or an extension of its length.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two species can happen due to multiple causes such as impact, shock, beating with a heavy object, or the tearing of very heavy objects and similar situations.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 The signature is when it happens from an extension slit.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens slowly over time and not immediately; it is an equal wound on the surface of the intestine, so that the slit compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 The signature of it when happens from a slit is because it causes immediate severe pain at the beginning; and it is different in appearance and beneath the skin while protruding further to cause its exit from the intestines and course towards the outside slit.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 On one occasion when I am treating an abscess of the intestine and at another time when I treat a fistula with feces (i.e., a condition where there is leakage of feces).
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And when the stone runs into the intestine and is held there, it has caused the nurse to be injured because it causes a pain in the groin and especially when it is pressed down.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 When practicing medicine with fear of the sharpness of this instrument, one must be careful that there may not be a cut from it (i.e., one should use such an instrument carefully to avoid injury).
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of treatment is that it must be used with great care so as to reduce the intestine by his hand into its own interior if he manages to remove them from within (i.e., a surgeon should insert their fingers into the anus and rectum during surgery).
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 After that it is put back on his chest between your hands, you will draw them out with a pair of forceps.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the wound that follows the wound upwards and dry the skin on both sides completely along its length (i.e., a surgeon should dry all of the scrotal skin from top to bottom).
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then make a two-hand cut of the circumcision with scissors in order to open it and complete the incision; then do this so that you can remove the skin by quantity, whatever is possible until he gets out of that way.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape off the skin under the scrotal wound until it reaches the white sheath (i.e., remove all of the scrotal skin from top to bottom).
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the interior of the scrotal cut (i.e., a surgeon should insert their fingers into the incision on that side).
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And you seek with your finger to make sure there is nothing from the intestine stuck inside of the white sheath (i.e., a surgeon should check for any debris or feces in that area).
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find something coming out, then pull it downwards towards the lower vent
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Afterwards you take a thick rope that is 10 fingers wide and insert it into the anus of the patient as far as possible, which involves removing his clothes beneath the testicles down to the underwear section: then cut through his four fingers from one end to the other
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Afterwards you complete the cross-shaped figure of them around certain parts with a rope as described earlier, which is beneath the testicles' ligature and can not move from one side to another unless something is pulled out from within them, which feeds them in order to prevent it from being cold
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 Afterwards you put a second ligature after the first one beyond two fingers' length
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 Afterwards you remove both ligatures from beneath the testicles in accordance with their length as digits and cut what remains all according to its roundness, leaving out one of them.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Afterwards you dry the lower part of the testicles' section from which blood flows and veins run, just as we did with what was previously mentioned.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Afterwards you administer a wet bandage into olive oil and put it on the wound: then administer the ligature that we did.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And when the white ligature that was mentioned is being used to stop bleeding after cutting into it, you must be careful not to let blood flow out of it.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Indeed many times this occurred.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 Afterwards you remove the ligature until it is cut through completely.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If however, his case takes longer than expected and delays in the bleeding, you administer a cold olive oil bandage over it until it stops bleeding.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Afterwards take care of the wound with the remaining treatment for wounds until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Farewell!
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this chapter I did not find anyone who had been cured of his ailment with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 But the first ones said that it is like what we have seen on Chapter 66.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "When it is necessary to cut off the vein above the incision and below it with ease; then dry in the middle, and care for it after that when it has been opened, until it falls down. And care for ulcers as we said, until they heal.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 "Of any injury to the urethra.
Caput LXVII.	 The 67th chapter
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 "When a rupture occurs in the urethra as we have described, and its place remains; but it does not go to the testicles anything from inside; if it goes down, it is only for that location, returning [to normal] throughout all hours; and if the emission is prolonged with time, there will be added an opening at the glans of the penis until the intestines return in the urethra.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 "And this happens from extending the glans of the penis as we have described.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 "Because it extends the glans; then it becomes soft and moves [to a new position], and comes to be.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 "And its care is with caution as was described before in that way.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 "Sometimes it is cared for by a steel, according to this manner; and it is as if he lies [on the floor] between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 "Then dry the place of the ruptured part and make it to become high; slice transversely by a distance equal to three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 "Then you will draw the foreskin back and when it has been drawn up [to expose the glans], what is below your thumb that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 "Then you will take the beam and place it above the high location from the foreskin, and press it towards the depths of the penis.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 "Then you will pull two locations above the ends of the radius from the foreskin and bind one with stitches to another; then remove both ends.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 "And do not cut the foreskin completely, nor pull it out, nor anything like that; as I taught you [before] when treating the intestinal muscles.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Therefore (or in other words) attend to those wounds
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you have cleaned it with a file and restored its structure, then it will be consolidated
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 After cleaning the wound properly (i.e., when there is no more dirt or impurity in it), it should not get worse (i.e., it shouldn't cause an increase in damage)
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 The cautery is better here because of its proximity to health
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 The treatment for the skin testicle
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter sixty-eight
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The treatment of the skin of testicles on some people causes an improvement in their flesh that is visible to them,
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it must be given to him who asks for the care of his testicles, that he may make a hole in their flesh and penetrate completely into the skin which has been mollified over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 After that, sew up two lips with a stitch and if there is more than three sutures on the skin of the mollified testicles, then four sutures are required; otherwise only one suture will be enough.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Cut through the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 After the care of the remaining wounds has been completed until everything is healed and the stitches fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 The castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter sixty-nine
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 I am aware of the fact that castration is forbidden by our law and for this reason it was allowed to me so that I wouldn't forget his name in my book; however, there is no need to remember him unless you want to do it two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 The one that is necessary so the doctor knows about this when asked by a patient; and so he may know how to care for him who has been affected by it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 Another way is that we practice castration on various animals for our use of it in the same manner as with other animals such as rams, goats, and cats, and others from different animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that castration will be performed according to two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Through attrition
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Through splitting and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 If through attrition something is done surgically (i.e., for skin grafts), that which we do to prepare the animal in warm water until its testicles are softened up and fall off, then you take them with your hand and wait until they harden back into place, not appearing under touch
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 For castration through splitting and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the animal down tightly while removing its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 After the suspensor and drying all over with a towel after each section is complete until both testicles are cut off at once; then you strike them down as they fall out so that nothing falls on top of it except for a small amount which should not be seen (I assume this means something like "except for a small piece, don't drop anything else onto the animal").
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that through attrition because in the latter case there was a risk of losing something from the testicles which would have been bad for the animal.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then you will cure his wound.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Of the two methods of treating Hermaphrodite wounds.
Caput LXX.	 The 70th chapter.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphrodite is treated through two methods
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 The wound is that which appears when following the gap or holding the testicles between two testicles where there is a figure like that of a woman with pubic hair and urine sometimes flows from it.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is a single kind of figure which is like that of a woman above the nipple so as to resemble the testicles of men in every way; one of them is like Priapus and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 The care of three types or that from men and two from women is as follows: you must hit the added flesh until the impression of them is gone.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then cure the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 In the second species of men from which urine is derived when it is in the mouth of the testicles, there is no operation to be done for that, nor is its care complete
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 On cutting off the scrotal skin and erecting the male genitalia
Caput LXXI.	 The seventy-first head.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 The foreskin is added to the natural part of it only when it is stretched and erects itself; and sometimes in some women greatly so that it extends as much as in men, and it remains until copulation occurs.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore you are advised to hold the foreskin with one hand or with a bandage and cut it off; but not finally at the incision itself, especially at its deep root (the frenulum); so that the flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then after curing the testicles
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 The anus is born from the womb's opening and extends itself; it may be likened to a tail, for that reason some call it 'the tailed anus'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore you are advised to cut off the anus just as you did with the foreskin; and cure (treat) it until it is cured
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 The cure for a virgin's urine which was not discharged through the vagina.
Caput LXXII.	 The seventy-second head.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The urine of a virgin is cured if it does not pass through the vagina or has passed through an opening in its passage (the vagina may be blocked).
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 Or it can also be natural (from a blockage) or accidental (such as from being caught by a man's hand).
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The accident (accidental) urine is cured if it has passed by force; and the same also fits into any of these ways (the womb or uterus, or its passage, or the upper or lower part of it); and prevents pregnancy and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation too.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 The knowledge of how to cure such urine is obtained through its appearance during childbirth (the appearance being the midwife's knowledge).
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 "If it is not apparent, then seek [it] with your fingers/hands, or by touch.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 "If the examination is done skillfully through the small finger, and it [the object] lies next to two lips, then remove/take her away.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 "And place on top of the two lower lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 "Then with both hands simultaneously take her by the side and let her fall forward onto your back, stretching out her limbs on top of yours.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 "Then extend two lips forcefully until a skillful examination is apparent/visible, and the object may be seen.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 "Then take hold of her hand and drink/swallow [her] into oil; place her there on the ground next to you, that she may continue to be with you every day until another place is not solidified.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 "If the finger is large and bent/bent back, then it's necessary to cut [it] off with a sharp knife that is similar in width.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 "If the examination is done through/on the body of a living being, then suspend her by her nails and strike [her] off; may you take upon yourself medicine that stops blood flow without cutting into any tissue, such as acacia or dragon's blood, and thus gather together with white lead.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then administer a large leaden rod to keep her from being taken by [someone] else; she will be held in place for days at a time, and then apply dry liniment so that any remaining injury may be cured.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 "And sometimes there will be birth of the fetus that was conceived as carrion by others; it is therefore necessary to cut [it] off according to this manner: until no part of its head is severed, do not let there exist a contradiction with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 "Of the cure for hemorrhoids and red veins on women's [lower] limbs.
Caput LXXIII.	 "Chapter Seventy-Three.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 "Hemorrhoids are the opening of the veins' orifices until/when blood flows in large amounts.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 As regards hemorrhoids, they are cured thusly: and I have said concerning division of their types, and the signs thereof; and I say this to you what receives care from them, and what does not
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, concerning those hemorrhoids which are within the mother's vagina and do not appear to anyone; then there is no care for them with a knife
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 Those that are from them into the vagina and fall on what senses can be cared for.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is fitting to approach a cold woman's house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then you extend the athelil with hooks or a cloth and strike them out of their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then wash the athelil with one incision of the veins and without biting or cutting; just like the acacia, dragon's blood, and similarly for them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then you drive his feet to the wall after an hour has passed.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, lay her into a cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the blood flow ceases; then make her sit in a decoction of wormwood and saffron, and of the grains, and of the galls, and similarly.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then you take the plowshare, and bind her with wool and vinegar; and make a frame of it over his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood flow ceases with him; then it is good; and if not, bind her down to his back, without cuts or wounds.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then you take wool and immerse it into the juice of tarahita or the juice of arnoglossa or the juice of ramorum aloes; that is to say, aloe-wood, wine pomegranate; bind her with this.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then you take care of him as long as his wound continues until he gets well.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Alburcius' rule is similar to the appearance of those who have had a stroke or are suffering from apoplexy.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is fitting to strike what appears out of him, as I said earlier; and take care of him until he gets well.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 On perforations that happen when they occur in the matrix
Caput LXXIIII.	 Skull number 72
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 They occur in the matrix from various causes such as cancer, and ulcers of bones or teeth, and abscesses, and bites by animals, i.e., herpes, boils, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and rectal prolapse.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 Indeed I have already explained all the diseases and signs of those things; I will explain here only the cure for them, and how to make an opening by a metal tool when they occur from the hemorrhoids.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore you must pay attention.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If there is pain when the opening of hemorrhoids occurs due to a blow or heat, it is acute with its own force, fire and fever; you will see redness appear: if it falls over him consciousness occurs at that time do not apply the perforation on him, but cure for him along with what causes injury above the maturation.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 It is necessary to put a woman over the buttocks that are in two seats and reclines, or puts one on his back and brings his legs up towards the lower part of the belly: then the buttocks will expand, and he places both his arms under his thighs, and he ligates (binds) each other with a suitable binding to this.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife goes on her right hand, and she administers the tool through which the opening of the matrix is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Which form are you referring to?
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you administer this tool that the woman look deeply into the womb of a pregnant woman, so as not to be damaged more than what was caused by the tool itself and the pain is alleviated.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the tool is more than deep, then it is necessary to place a cushion on the base of the womb so as not to allow all the way into the womb; and it is necessary that it puts the hernia which flows in the tool from above the left: and it should keep the tool, and it should revolve the ministering of the hernia until the opening of the deep womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 The excision is seen and grasped by hand, it is soft and gentle; thus you must remove this from its place on your head with a blunt instrument.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 After the excision is done and removed from your head with a blunt instrument, you must place it back into its cavity submerged in oil of roses; either by using the oil for hair care (oil of figs), which has some stickiness to it; or by using the oil of love-apples, where there is no stickiness. In any case, after placing it back, you should remove part of it from deep within your roots.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place an external coating over the face and nose with a solution submerged in water; this is where the harmful stings are located.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 After two days have passed when you apply ointment that suited it, until it becomes healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And when the cloth and wound is washed through with water and mud; then you apply a solution that dissolves it along with water and mud or else with water where the root of lily or long-flowering aralia are located, until it returns to its place after being applied on top of it.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the removed wound is embedded within a clot inside the cloth, then you must remove it with care using iron, after which you should apply the same treatment as before (in division).
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Regarding the childbirth doctrine, similarly to how embryos are delivered from the womb in a unnatural manner.
Caput Lxxu.	 Caput Lxxu
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first understand the normal birth form.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 So if you see a woman being held down by her lower limbs and desires to breathe air; after this is done she lies on the same object from birth which suffocated the child at birth, and then the child's exit occurs above her head (or in any other unnatural manner). At that time you know that this birth was according to a natural figure of childbirth.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 So when you see these signs, it is necessary for the obstetrician to restrain his belly so that he will descend or sooner drop from it.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When he lowered himself on his head it descended from him and was separated by a good separation of its contents
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 Who is beyond this birth is unnatural and admirable
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 When he sometimes descends upon the feet of his own and descends him before its head, and then turns them away; or the foot becomes one with the hand it has become one and the hand is now a foot: or perhaps it will be carried to his head, but similar figures are made by very admirable people.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore the Obstetrician should be prudent and knowledgeable of all things related to childbirth, so that he may save himself from error and death: and I am showing you all figures from there, such as his genius in them is, and it signifies through that, and stands upon itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When he descends the fetus onto his own head with a natural exit and is lifted by it to another woman and makes childbirth difficult for her and makes its power decline; then she sits upon him or holds him: and there are carried away with the foenix fruit decoction and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the Obstetrician inserts herself between her fingers and finds with him another one, and holds it out from underneath; until she reaches what is within her by moisture, and frees both women so that the fetus can be lowered.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If he does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be carried away with a foenix fruit decoction and with humid oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then she loosens him after the basket so that he may be compressed; and makes her straighten up with the conditions, holds his mouth and nose together for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus is quickly descending.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus are descended first, then it is necessary that they be lowered with great haste and ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If she does not enter into the delivery, then let the woman sit upon him and raise her feet above; afterwards place the head over the earth; and hold the woman so that she may not fall from shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 "If the hands do not progress and the fetus dies; then he shall strike off the hand along with the fetus, and extract what is left of the fetus while holding it with a cloth and extracting him while maintaining equality.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 "The death of the fetus by means of his own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 "When the fetus descends upon its own feet, then it is necessary to push them downwards with all one's might; after that gently turn the fetus over.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 "Then he shall take hold of his foot and gently pull him out.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 "When they reach the hips, he shall grip him so that his body is compressed; if God wills it, then he will ascend.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 "And if he does not ascend with him when we have lifted him up, then gently lower the fetus while maintaining its normal posture.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 "Then let him go forth easily at that time (i.e., after the fetus is extracted).
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 "If that be permitted with him entirely what we have lifted up; then take hold of his feet gently and apply pitch, and gum. And when they are well soaked through, strike off the whole into a mortar and crush it thoroughly in a good stroke: after that bind her [i.e., the woman] tightly to prevent her from descending, and tie a knot to prevent her from ascending.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 "Then let him sit for a while in hot water until he is heated up.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 "When they are heated through and the lower part of him is soft to touch, then let her (i.e., the midwife) gently apply myrrh and tie him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 "Then gently place her upon his feet.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 "After that gently turn him over, tie the lower part of his mouth and nose tightly together; then press upon the lower part of her abdomen easily.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 "The fetus will ascend immediately (i.e., after it is extracted).
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 "Death of the fetus by means of his own legs.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 "When he descends according to this manner, then gently put your hand inside him slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 "Then the woman lies on her back and brings up both of her feet to an upper part; then she rests upon a board with her face downwards, her hands supporting herself.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 "Then he (the surgeon) gently raises him from underneath in the slowest manner possible.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 "Then, by means of a cord beneath her feet, she is raised onto it (a board) from below upwards to the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 "If not born prematurely, then take his feet in your hand and gently move them with a slow motion upwards.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 "Then the surgeon gently raises him from above downwardly to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 "Then he puts his hands on it and gently holds him down; then assists the woman to hold up her head so that she can be compressed.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 "The child's death hangs downward from the surgeon's hand.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 "The hand of the surgeon is loosened up so that he can be pulled downwards.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 "If she cannot be drawn down then take her away and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 "Then if walking is not possible, she will be put on the board face downwards with her knees drawn up.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 "Then he applies a medicament that you have prepared from herbs.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 "If she has given birth to him then make her sit upon the chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 "Then he puts his hands upon him and gently holds him down; then assists the woman to hold up her head so that she can be compressed.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 "The child's death happens above his own back and is brought to the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 "The midwife holds him with one hand of the fetus and then gently moves him slowly along to her.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 "Then he puts on it (a board) over his own back that we have prepared from oil and herbs.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Therefore gently press him down.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then lie the patient on his back and gently press him downwards so that he extends both of his arms out to the sides.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then gently press down on him in order to compress him while maintaining a certain level of tension.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The fetus is lifted up from the lower part and placed over the head.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When descending into the second hole through which way you came in this manner with your finger, until it is opened by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is placed above face then its neck and back are cut until it doesn't hold on any longer and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then pull the fetus towards inside until you place it in accordance with what is necessary and press down on a woman so that she compresses him for as long as possible, at which point he will depart in death.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Death of twins or multiple fetuses
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 It is known that twins are often born and sometimes three and four are also born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However this is unusual and rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Certainly one of the five is outside nature and does not move freely but continues to be held by the other multiples with a cord from his umbilical cord that distinguishes between them which separates through forceps while distinguishing among them what is connected to each one of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes a fetus departs as easily and naturally as the other does by death through an open exit or easily and easily by desirable death like we said before.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If any of them are difficult to find near the birth and so they can be brought together by those unnatural figures as we described before with care for them like we said, then let there be a soft death that allows him to do what he does easily and slowly while making sure everything is done according to all shapes along with what has been prepared for him from his mind leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 This was the formation of this one out of the embryos and their abortion.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 "When one clot is formed in the matrix, and two clots are made, and three clots, and four clots, and five clots, and six clots, and seven clots, and ten clots: And it has been used on me by a woman who aborted and emitted seven, and another dozen, all shaped.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 "As for the measurement of the glorious wise men.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore everything must be related to obstetric knowledge
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 "Otherwise, he would not compete with her on that matter.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 "Of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 The 76th part (chapter).
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 "When you are treating a dead fetus with the same method I mentioned earlier and it does not work out as expected, then you should operate with your hand in order to succeed.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 "If the woman is healthy in virtue and does not have any accidents that she fears to be deprived of her: then it should be ensured that she puts her head downward on a surface, put both hands over her breasts, and lift up her feet so they are elevated above them: and she should hold her with two sides or bind her onto the breast in order to prevent removal from below.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 "Then, by using the mouth of the uterus and with the help of a woman who is a nurse: she should lubricate them so that they pass down to the lower part of the womb in order to expel the fetus.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 "Then, with her hand and using these oils and mucus, she should put it into the uterus gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 "And then, as soon as she is at a place where the fetus is coming out: bring her to that location.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 "Then consider that if the fetus is prepared so it descends over its head: then put the eye on him, or his neck, or mouth, or palate of him, or under his beard, or in his wing, or at a place near the ribs and under the breast.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 "If he fell from above his feet, then onto his chest and ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 "And let him hold the right hand with his left hand and place a bandage over it on that part of his body where we mentioned (i.e., chest or ribs). Let him enter into contact with his right hand as easily as possible, and remove from there to what is at the end between the left fingers.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 "Then let him hold onto his right hand with another or third finger as much so that the grip is equal and does not go to the end of it.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 "Then let him stretch his right hand with equal force and not according to the straight line alone (i.e., in all directions), so that it reaches all parts equally, lest he die; thus is it done when tearing out of his mouth.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 "And let him soften the stretch on what is between them (i.e., chest or ribs) so that it is easy for use to open and close.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 "If any part of the above is held onto by his fingers as he falls from it, then let the Obstetrix place her fingers with oil on that side and enter into contact with them in order to use what is held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 "If the part of the fetus comes out first, then let the fingers be changed to another who is higher in order and this must continue until the whole fetus has been removed.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 "If the hand comes out before another and it is not possible to reduce (or lessen) its movement because of its hardness/cohesion, then let him enter into contact with a bandage.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 "Then pull her out until the whole of her has been removed; you can either cut through a strap or use an instrument to cut off and then let him do this with his other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 "If the head of the fetus is large or if it has been coarted by its own weight during delivery, and a mass of water gathers at his head; then let him enter into contact with the fingers as sharp as nails (i.e., the Spatumile spinosum), and find it together with the head, and remove from there the water or remove it using an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape is similar to that of all other instruments in the chapter following this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 "If a fetus is in its natural state with large head size, then it must be extracted by cutting through the umbilical cord as we have mentioned.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 After you extract the fetus from the umbilical cord, remove the bones using tongs or forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If its head is removed and placed within a womb (of the uterus), then it shall be found there after being cut open by moisture which exists in the breast.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If the head does not adhere to or slip off of it, then strike its head forcefully until it separates from there as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If the fetus is located below the ribs and there is no water inside it (it has been removed from a womb), then you must remove it forcefully until moisture flows out of it as mentioned before.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is above its feet (meaning in a womb), then the removal thereof is easy and directing it towards the mouth of the mother is done easily.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If the head is caught within a womb or breast (of the mother), then you must remove it forcefully with a cloth that you placed over your hand and find its womb or breast until moisture flows from both of them as mentioned before.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the remaining parts are removed and the head is obtained, then an obstetrician should insert her left hand within to extract it as mentioned before.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the mouth of the mother is opened (meaning she has given birth), then an obstetrician should insert her left hand deeply within to extract it forcefully and hold onto its head until water flows from both inside it as mentioned before.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the mouth of the mother is caught (meaning it has not been opened), due to a cold and harsh wind that hit him, then there should be no attempt to force it apart from its moisture as mentioned before, instead administer a soothing drink for his body and mind: then extract water to fill its void and soothe his thirst.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is above its own height, then it is possible to equalize (meaning both are at same level), so administer what we mentioned as amniotic fluid for the fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 "If it is not possible for this thing, then it will be done with force and removed.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 "You should ensure that nothing remains within the second chamber from now on.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 "Once you have completed your surgery, then administer what we previously mentioned for warming the arteries that happen to go through the veins.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 "If a blood flow blockage occurs, then it will descend into the arms and you should administer any remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 "I have just heard of a woman whose child died after being pregnant with another child. Afterwards the other child also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 "Therefore he had a very long post-term pregnancy and became swollen after a while until it was opened, at which point it started to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 "I therefore called for the cure of his disease and was treated with long time care until the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 "Therefore I put it over him from certain strong attractions, but he was expelled from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 "Afterwards a few days passed and the other one came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 "I am amazed therefore when there is no longer an outlet for the disease to come out of his belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 "I thought then because a child had died from the bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 "I therefore called for a cure and removed many bones from the woman who was present among better dispositions. Afterwards he remained so long that it released only a little bit of pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 "And I did not establish this here for nothing because of the knowledge that was within him and assistance to do what the medical expert does with his hand by using a cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 "Of the forms necessary for the extraction of the child.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 "This is the form of the stricture below, whose books are equal to those that have two equal veins on both sides of the two stems.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 "However this stricture should be of a more delicate kind and it is required to make it either from the belly or from the two stems.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 The breadth of the two arms is as much like the length of two fingers; and each one has a margin that is just half the size of a finger; the length of both of them together adds up to half of their breadth; and in between those two limbs there are two additions from the same type of wood, which have already been shaped into hooks. And the breadth of either side is as much like two fingers, or less than that.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 Those two additions are inserted into the mouth cavities such that you may perceive them when you want to pull out two needles
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The shape of the needle is perceived as a matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another shape resembling it (the needle), more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 The stick must be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the resemblance of the handle.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, there are two additions at the end of it (the handle), as you have seen here above; and the length of all those additions is like half a finger; and the breadth on either side is just double fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you want to remove a needle from it (the handle), then let the woman who is standing on her back above the board support the feet of that man, holding with both hands the part between his legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert those two additions into the needle together; and you hold on to its lower end between his thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument just like you do when opening your mouth; and equally in proportion to its quantity as much as you did from opening your lips, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Another shape of a needle that was mentioned before; the shape of the forceps with which the fetus is pulled out
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of Alcindus, from which a large head is taken; and its resemblance to forceps that have teeth at the end, just like you mentioned it.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And when there are difficulties, as the forceps follow this shape, just like you mentioned it; and the teeth of such a forcep is the same as those used for incision and counter-contraction.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 Form a loop that cuts off hair
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 One feather per person
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 Two feathers per person
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 A saw that cuts off the head of an unborn child.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 Two scissors for cutting off one's own head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 Form of the two scissors and also lators (scissors with long handles used by barbers)
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These implements are used for all kinds of work and their various species increase; they are also found in the hands of artisans and artists as well as men because of its quantity (referring to the scissors).
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not take away from them an implement unless it is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 It is inexcusable to be lacking anything necessary
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 On the removal of the second
Caput LXXVIII.	 78th head
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Second is held at birth, then it must be as weak as possible so that its desire to stay may prevail over any resistance
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then let him make a knot with his hand on the ear of the one who is holding it and then tie its mouth to that same ear.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If therefore this becomes necessary, it is good (referring to a medical procedure).
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not, then take an implement for cutting holes; and perform this operation in the workshop's entranceway, placing herbs that open the mouth of the patient on it, such as calamus, rue, and mint, and others, and camomile, and centauream: take all these herbs or those you find them, and submerge them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then put the ear of the donkey over the entranceway hole and fix it with its other end on the mouth of the patient; then hold it until his water is flowing into the mouth of the patient.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then let him make a knot as described before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 The Second will be easily held on its own.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 "If this preparation has not been removed and does not heal (the wound), then apply obstetrics to make the hand wet with olive oil or tallow.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 "After that, insert it into a bladder and let it remain with her for a second time.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 "So she becomes wet with it, then she takes hold of it and spreads it evenly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 "If it is inserted into deep [i.e., the uterus], then insert your hand according to what we previously showed you, until she becomes wet with the Second Lady, and extends her evenly on both sides as much as possible. But be careful not to let her fall at a strong attraction in the opposite direction, lest this leads to an unwanted pregnancy: it is necessary that you allow her to move gently towards your right and left, then add the required amount of oil.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 "Once she has been taken hold of thusly, be prepared for it, and guide her away from the edges.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 "If the uterus is cramped up (i.e., dilated), we have shown you before how to care for her with a gentle stroke and by using oils or herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 "If she does not heal according to what we have shown you before, do be cautious so that you don't drag her too hard during the process of getting out.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 "It is necessary to make sure she is wet with it at the opening of her womb and guides towards a woman's side.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 "After that, wipe her off with oil or ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 "But if she gets spoiled after a day and dissolves away, then heal (her).
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 "However, when it becomes spoiled and emits a bad smell to the stomach or head, take her away.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 "Therefore, let people administer appropriate fumigations for this purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 "Some ancient men have become experts in fumigations of musty things and of dry ones.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 "The form of the instrument used for fumigation to be applied at the time when menstruation begins or is held back by the Second Lady (Second Lady's period).
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 "Let the hand be cut off like a limb (amputate), or let it be broken so that an open space is made at its tip; and then place there fat over a fire, and the smoke will enter through [the opening], until the limb is consumed.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 "Of Ani's cure: not perforated.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 "Many boys are born; and the Ani of these boys remain unpierced, for they were healed by a subtle Sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife is advised to remove her finger from between their thighs, and if not, pierce them with a sharp instrument; then let her hold tight so that it may not touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 "Then place over his body fat from wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 "The cure is given to him with the children until he becomes well.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 "However if there are many days of illness, then bind him to a bed with a leaden band and let the nurse tend him.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 "And also the Ani was struck by the swelling of the belly or the buttocks.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, the midwife is advised to attend upon his consolidation (or the swelling); and then continue with him as we described in the previous cure.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 "Of fistulas that occur at the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 "The fistulas that occur at the lower part are nodation and grossitude which occur near the anus; or one of their parts; and it is a fistula, either one or many.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 "As time passes, the nodation comes out, and flows from her a clear white water, or a subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they are penetrative fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore the penetrative fistulas are recognized through this which comes out from emission and from a discharge; or it may come from them because of their weakness.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 "And fistulas are sometimes until they reach the vulvae and up to the vaginae of man.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 The penis penetrates up to the scrotum and down to the base of the tail
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this also the fistulas penetrate up to the anus and down to where it is not penetrable. If you want to introduce your finger as an indicator there, try to gently insert yourself into the fistula with a small tool (such as a probe made of iron or other suitable material). However, if there's no tortuousness in inserting anything else, then you can use a long and slender instrument like a finger.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is tortuousness within it, then I insert myself gently into the fistula with a small probe or hairpin.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you don't feel the same penis as before and nothing comes out of it or it doesn't become smooth like what I mentioned earlier, then that is not penetrable; in such a case it would be appropriate to examine further.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when a fistula is penetrating up to the urethra or bladder (in women), its meaning is the death of urine from it and it's forbidden for that location to be cured with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it penetrates up to the scrotum or the anus (in men), its meaning is that you should try and reach as far as possible without tortuousness there. You must investigate pain in nearby parts and always note pus from it. And if medicine can't be used, neither does ointment cure it nor is it consolidated with anything else.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And for all fistulas that penetrate in these cases there is no universal cure and the care of them is work and time consuming with the use of medicines to make it into shape.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In the case where it is not penetrable and no cure has been found with other methods, you should try to get a firm hold on its back between your hands; then stretch one hand up towards its tailbone and the other down towards its scrotum as far as possible so that both sides can be pulled apart.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Once you've inserted yourself gently into the fistula and felt for any tortuousness (if there is one), try to find out how far it extends with your finger or something similar as an indicator.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If someone is suffering from a broken finger, then it must be treated by inserting your index finger into their mouth
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you are trying to insert your finger into their mouth, go ahead and try inserting it as far as possible through their nose (or any other part of the body) - but know that this will not heal them because they cannot be healed in such a way, as we have stated earlier.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They also said that sometimes healing is possible through food and medication for a wound; therefore, use subtle cautery as described before to insert the flame into their anus until it reaches (the finger).
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then continue with this method once more or twice until you are sure that all the flesh has been burned off and is like a fistula (anus).
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then continue with the treatment using a spatula to spread it onto the flesh until all of them are removed; then continue with the treatment using ointments to apply meat and bind wounds, as we have described before.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If that method heals them, this is good news.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it cannot be healed using any other treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if you succeed in inserting your finger into their anus (or any other part of the body), and it is between your finger and the fistulas or between your finger and another area that hurts - then wet the cut on the fistula with water until it heals, and afterwards pull out your hand as soon as possible.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then wash off those burned pieces of flesh that become fistulae (anus), so they do not remain on them anything.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If your finger bleeds while inserted into you and the slit (or incision) where it was inserted to cut off the flesh - then do this instead: use cautery with fire or sharp medicine as we have described before, until that part heals.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 "When a cautery is attached to fire and it has the ability to damage good tissues but not bad ones, burning of certain parts will remove blood from those parts, and cooling them.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 "Then apply it with ointments or cloths soaked in vinegar until the pus comes out, and then remove those swollen pieces of meat to pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 "Then apply a treatment with solidified ointments that harden the meat, and these are medicines which contain stiffness and cooling.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 "When they finish cooking, then they will be finished eating; not more iterations.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 "If the fistula has already penetrated through to the depth of the arm, and is extended by excess body fluids; then insert your finger into its opening, and examine it with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 "If you feel a temptation to do so, between you and it is through flesh or skin, then the operation on that part must not be made, except according to how much trust and hope there is.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 "This is because one of the three ways to administer it will be cautery as we said before, or you cut her so that she can follow him and his ability comes out, making it possible for you to enter his opening.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 "Do not proceed with the cutting too much so that you do not cut off the consciousness of his arm or hit him as he falls and falls out of exhaustion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 "Then apply it as we said before.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 "In other words, it can be applied if he will be healed; stretch his hand until the excess is removed and extends to his arm as we said before, or with a temptation or using another acute extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 "Then make those filtered pieces which are in the cutting until you can with purification.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 "Then cure the ulcers of all by cutting and fixing up above where it is consolidated; and remain the fistula open on the inner part anus, and there will be a lot less over weakness.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And when you encounter a fistula in this manner: and it is, when you attempt to penetrate into the fistula: and it is at its side about the surface of the body with a cut and edge of the finger: then take the attempted perforation of the extremities, which is as if a needle, that is, by this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 You insert five fingers into it around and about.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then I attempt with the thread to penetrate into the fistula until a resulting injury occurs on him.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If then you penetrate into the finger's edge on the inside near, then remove from it a thread by that means and take your finger to the anus, and extract the extremity of the filament, and collect both extremities simultaneously: and hold one or two strings, and let go at once or after two days: and if there is any penetration into the flesh with the filament, tie him well so as not to occur those cuts which are between the two extremities of the filament. And then apply a remedy for healing until he becomes consolidated and cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If the opening of the fistula is not penetrable: then do as follows for you until it becomes deep enough.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 There isn't something there so that you don't cause injury to him.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as we have said until he is cured
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of a fistula found in the body which has a sharp curve and one part is not acute to prevent injury where it's not necessary as you would say.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Suture hemorrhoids from which the blood flows out by incision of them: and the remedy is to be made for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 The end
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 hemorrhoids are two ways
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they may be within the anus like black charcoal or coals of hell, or as if they were warts on them.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them there are small ones and big ones too, and the blood flows out of them always, and it is one and many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 "There are others beyond him, and at his extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those which are beyond him are the least abundant of moisture, by means of which flows bitter water or by a very slow course of blood; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 The care which is within him is such that he becomes most weak and is expressed until the anus opens up; after this expression occurs, they appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, suspend them with your fingers or hold on them with your nails.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut off those at the roots of theirs.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If your fingers are unable to hold them due to their moisture and softening, then cover them with a bandage or cloth; or if you cannot do so easily remove them with your thumb nail.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut off those and burn some of the hot coals on top of them after cutting to prevent their movement in that place.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or burn them according to what was mentioned before in the chapter about cautery.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with any remaining care until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus did not open quickly then use a small ligature of a type that is used for cutting off the finger to hold it closed while you express yourself with what is inside your anus and obey the command given to you when you express yourself forcefully.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 However if the hemorrhoids are external from your anus, it is easy; and you can catch them with your finger or nail, or cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as mentioned before until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 If someone is holding the cut with a knife then you should apply sutures to hold them according to this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take the thread and introduce it into the anus.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then take the hemorrhoids out on top and let it penetrate with a sharp needle from one side to the other; then tie off both extremities of the thread, beneath, and bind them together tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 "Then remove the knot and pull out the abscess.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 "After that, take it all with both hands, release one of them, so that blood may flow out from the excess.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 "Then put a cloth soaked in fresh oil on it, or grease it with olive oil, and place it over the wound so that it may rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 "After that, remove it so that it might fall off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 "Thus the others are cared for with ointments and the remaining part is treated until they become well.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 "And about the healing of wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 "Many a wound results from the action of pus and constriction by nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 "Thus they are treated to prevent them from becoming dry and hard; the upper crust is removed which prevents their joining together.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 "After that, cure them so as to be healed according to what must happen.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 "If they do not join together as before, then the following time you must use a more severe treatment so that much blood flows and the rest of them are cured afterwards.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 "About the cure for abscesses among people but not among animals; of those affected by them and the poultice.
Caput LXXXII.	 "Chapter Eighty-Two
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 "You know that an abscess is a rounded knot of the body color resembling the top of your head; it occurs all over the body, especially on the feet and fingers, causing pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 "It is therefore necessary to seek out what is on the outside and hold it with fingers or nails, so that you can remove its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 "After that for this, if he cautorizes it according to what was previously mentioned.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 "But one of the dry abscesses is called a prominent pustule, rough, filtered and rounded on top of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 Many children die from injuries
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 His care is to stretch him on a board and hit him until he dies, or strangle him with a cord, or strike him with a staff until dead.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you are unable to do that with a board and strike him, cauterize him according to what was prescribed by fire or an acute medicine; until they are burned away on the board, not having been strangled with the instrument I call for.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 And the ant is also a poisonous one, large and covering the surface of the body, going into its depths; when it strikes him with cold, there is felt by it like an ant sting, and it falls on the whole body; and many are injured from this in their hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 His care is to capture the ant with an arrow from a pheasant or a strong goose feather; and fix it on the ant until its circle of the feathers surrounding him is contained.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then move your hand with the stick until you separate what is around the ant; and place her in a deep part of the body, and kill the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you are unable to do that with an air feather or iron according to this shape
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 The stick is placed at the top of the feathers so that it reaches over to his hand and he can reach back to release him from this shape.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you are unable to cauterize the ant according to what was prescribed for Athelil's cauterization, in chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 In this section are described the instruments which are used to treat the boils and ulcers of Ani, as well as remedies for them.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Whenever the boil was caused by silver or gold dust, or air bubbles, or metal flakes.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And whenever it happened with these instruments which are used to treat them (the boils and ulcers).
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 That which is administered for infants' and children's use should be a pure medicine; and if they are delicate or ill, it ought to be milder
Clistere magnum.	 The greatest remedy
Cistere paruum.	 To alleviate their suffering
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The remedy is to apply a compress made of the upper part of their head and attached with thread; it should be loosened as gently as possible so that if inserted into their mouth or anus, it will not cause pain, but rather gently stretch them open without causing excessive trauma: each ear has two foramina on its side and one on the back.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 The compress should be of such size that it can easily fit through the smallest part of the ear canal; but not too large lest it might cause damage to the inner ear: and if applied from a bladder or piece of linen, its root (i.e., the thread) should only have one finger's breadth.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 The compress will be inserted into each ear opening as many times as necessary until the space between all foramina is filled with a finger's breadth;
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Afterwards thread firmly inserted from 10 threads or otherwise, and tied into the side of it so that there is no space between the compress and the ear canal.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 Afterwards when applied to their head as a compress with thread tied around its circumference, it should be tightened by compressing gently between two distinct points using strong compression.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Afterwards the compress is bound tightly around them.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is how one circle has been depicted in these drawings and foramina.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of the compress when bound around them is as follows: that it may be cool from a cold remedy; or applied with warm water from medical substances which are heated to the extent of being comfortable for use; and that it will not burn or freeze.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Afterwards the patient is placed prone on their back and their legs are extended upwards; they then place it under there, that is, over men's skin or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Afterwards with oil, or alum, or the juice of fenugreek, or similar things;
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 In the beginning put it (the object) gently in the arm.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 After it has entered, let one of your assistants hold onto it with both hands and the other assist by applying pressure from outside, until it is completely out through the esophagus into the stomach.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 After removing the instrument, remove the used pieces of your assistant's arms to one side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If you need further help in order to push it out, hold onto it as strongly as possible until it comes out completely
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if it falls asleep during the whole night without coming out, then do not be discouraged and try again when you wake up the next day.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you place it into a solution of vinegar (or other strong acid) and the vomit comes out as well with it, then use another one until that one is done vomiting.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If hemorrhoids or anal fistulas are present and causing pain, then use a very small, gentle, and narrow instrument for this purpose, such as one that children would use to clean their anus.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And in order to avoid any injury or damage, the instrument should be soft but not too flexible.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Regarding the treatment of wounds on the head without causing a fracture of the bones.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 The 84th part of the treatise.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already spoken about the treatment of wounds and how it should be done with both hands, as well as in combination with medicines.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 I now say that wounds will be treated according to what they are and where they fall.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, when many wounds occur, they are treated with a variety of things such as incisions or cautery, or strikes with a lance or stick, or using a blade, arrow, or bowstring; and similarly in all these ways by various things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur in accordance with the location of the body are treated similarly to wounds on the head or neck or chest or stomach and similar from these areas.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am now explaining treatments for the remaining wounds in order to complete my discussion of wound treatment.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 I begin with simple cuts on the heads of those who have forgotten their composition.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore,
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple cut on the head occurs without breaking bones; then consider that it may be from a stone or one of those things and immediately apply some ointment to stop the bleeding: but do not delay, as this could lead to death by prolonged bleeding. Also, if there is no prohibition against phlebotomy in your text (bleeding through veins), you should also remove the blood slowly with a thin needle, taking care to avoid injury from excessive pressure on the vein walls.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And if there is bleeding due to the opposite side of an incision or a cut.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 If he drinks heavily and eats large quantities,
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If the prohibition on drinking or eating is in effect, then decrease his food intake, but avoid using excessive force when drawing blood from him, and also do not cut open his veins to remove the blood unless it was specifically allowed for phlebotomy.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And if a cold ointment is applied over the wound and he drinks something containing alcohol or an astringent, then let him drink this mixture with oil alone (if there's no alcohol), or mixed with wine containing some astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are sure that the bleeding has stopped after applying a cold ointment and he is drinking something containing alcohol or astringency, then place this same ointment over it if there is his own blood; otherwise, you should apply some other unguent to stop it.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or of another nature and cannot be closed with lips or a similar method, then close it as I will show you for closing wounds on the inside.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If a bone is already removed and he still bleeds and there is no retention of the blood after trying to stop it with an emesis bowl (a type of container for vomit), then cut him open immediately.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 After that, cure the wound with medicines and restore flesh to where it was cut from; also prepare food for him if he is weak so that his appetite may be restored, as you would do for someone who has lost weight, until he can eat normally again, like those of us who are well.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 When pus enters into a wound and does not go away from the bone, then cut out all the pus at once, and throw it away; after that take care of the patient
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If there is an artery within a wound from which blood flowed; and it does not come out through medical means, then examine the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 Therefore, if you cannot cut off that thing (pus), dry her with a sponge, or tie it up tightly.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the need arises when you cannot perform what we have said (perform surgery), then burn it off until blood ceases to flow.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If those wounds are simple and easy to heal, then you should wash over them a poultice (poulticing material) so that the swelling is reduced; for once it has been bound up before it can break through the skin.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of poutering an infant
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Grind up one olive part, and the parts of a dragon's blood two times; do not use any calcified parts three times: make it all together in much quantity, and have it ready for poutering over his wound, and bind him tightly with good binding until he holds well on to himself, then coagulate with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 After that bind him tightly above with poutering materials, and let him go down gently so as to prevent him from staying on; then cut off the pouterings when he has gone away.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 Therefore, there is no medicine to get rid of it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes when he does this alone with olive oil and the blood of a dragon, where you do not have what is needed at that moment in healing wounds, when he puts it on top and ties tightly together; there are recent wounds from its own blood which have not changed the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If that thing in the air has already changed due to some alteration, especially when you are in a time of autumn; then there is no intention of our poutering on this matter: therefore take care of it with what we have said so that you put something healing over his wounds, such as olive unguents or pouter materials made from barley flour and water, until pus comes out.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 In the meantime, care of that which remains to be cured shall continue until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If a man falls and breaks his leg bone, it is set, then afterwards I say to remove that which was fractured while using the gesture; and now, after saying this, I shall proceed to fracture the head bones of him who is to come next [i.e., the patient].
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Of the collarbones.
Caput LXXXV.	 Skull 85
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If the man falls on his collarbone, then there is no difference between him and someone else as far as treatment goes; but when he has broken only a single bone of the skull.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the first bone of his collarbone has already been broken (artery), then if he is broken in that way; there is no difference between him and another unless he receives treatment with someone else's assistance to bind up his wound severely as they do when a man is falling, saying 'Bind him up!' until similarly.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because the veins are being hurt, and they fight back against them
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 Do not apply anything cold to the wound at all; because the substance of veins is cold, and its continuation is with brain, which is superior among members; and that by which healing takes place from drugs alone, as a stone put into sweet wine, or oil, and turpitude when washed away with sweet water; and the remaining minerals according to this mode, and wet unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If a man's wound is large, then apply sutures; or let him breathe with his lips closed.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime, keep on caring for that which remains to be cured until they are healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If a man's wound is deep, or he has broken his nose near the bottom of it where now pus gathers; then dig out all that you can from there with greater care.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If there is already an incision in the vein of his wound, and he has been bled; then separate or dry it up with a bandage, bind her on, or burn [cauterize] her if there is no other choice available.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the epiglottis has been incised or completely excised and you have no alternative, then cover the hole made with sutures over a needle in the throat and do not cut through it; rather, sew up its edges to match the figure of the healthy one.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Afterwards, gently stretch the incision along its line, and in time it will heal on its own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards care for it with ointment to remove swelling and itching until it heals
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If a hole has been made in the bone and you cannot remove all of it, then leave only what can be removed; until the wound is no longer rotten or separates out on its own.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If a wound has been cleaned up as much as possible and you have another one ready to use, then cover the first with it (the second), sealing them together tightly.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If you find a fistula in the wound and remember that it was mentioned in his chapter on fistulas (or perhaps some other part of your book).
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Of wounds in sponges.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter Eighty-six
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If the lance has hit something and you know its depth, then consider this carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 Therefore, if there is a smell coming from the wound and you suspect that it might be fatal, then know that the wound is deadly.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If its depth is not known and it only has its own blood, then do not put the second one into it right away; nor sew it up or stretch it, so that there will be no blood trapped within it and it won't become an abscess, but instead apply a lubricant to it twice daily.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If you do not have lubricant at the moment, then insert it into the wound with your own (or another clean one), so that whatever comes out from its moisture can be applied to the hole; and let the patient rest on top of the wound until what is added to it drains away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 "If after three days of rest no worsening occurs and there is no weakening of the limb, nor tremor of the heart, nor any restriction in breathing, but only good dispositions remain with him; then you know that he has a cure.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore treat and care for him along with remedies and the rest of his treatment until he recovers.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 "If the healing of his disease is complete and always open thereafter; then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 "Therefore treat this fistula separately from its opening.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 "And if it is from a cut into the arm or armpit and is simple on the surface of the chest; or from the back; treat him with that which preceded his suture, if there was one, as before he did. If not, then separately for each according to its size: either when you have inserted it, if it's small; otherwise together with what went before.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 "If he has already made an incision into the bone and a fistula is formed as a result of this; then investigate the fistula separately from removing it.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 "If they are not separate, then let them be separated until putrefaction sets in and their removal is necessary.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 "However the judgment regarding his disease and its accidents should be given to us [the translators] by examining him along with other members of his treatment.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 "The following is about hernias in the groin, their exits and their exit; namely:
Caput LXXXVII.	 "Chapter eighty seven.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 "The rupture that occurs from the inside is great or medium in size; small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 "However on occasion when this large intestine comes out and it becomes separated at a place where there are numbers of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 "This is why an introduction occurs for them; the suture around their opening is stronger and more difficult than that which surrounds the large intestine.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 "However, a rupture from the outside can also be very difficult.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 "Therefore, if you do not promptly restore them to their place after they have been introduced, because of the swelling and closing off; for this is why an entrance into him will be very difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 For this reason therefore a better division of parts is made; because when it could not be reduced to the intestines as was done for the dissicilis, two species were applied instead.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Sutures are placed according to four methods
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 The two common sutures join to the suture of the belly and the other one joins with the ribs and others on their own side.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 Nevertheless, a more personal connection is formed through the suture of the belly; I am speaking to you with one and only one exposure, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore I say because when a fistula is formed and something comes out of it from the intestines; and it was difficult to reduce this one; then that is done by means of one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the pain from division, as we said before; or when there is an inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Therefore if that happens then you must warm him up by putting hot water on him and by plunging a sponge into cold water; or a wet cloth soaked in lukewarm water can be used.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or you could pour warm water over him and cool his body down with ice; until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Whenever you do that with a drink that has starch mixed into it; and it's better than just water alone to resolve the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 After you have already resolved the inflation then warm up the intestines by using a drink that has been boiled or with oil.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 That is because of the entrance into him due to the fistula.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If however after this treatment has been done and he improves then seek out for a division with an instrument that deals with hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 The first cure is better when prepared than the cutting; and there can be no cooperation to deal with things that need further attention or a defective instrument after necessity.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 One part of him is thin and sharp, the other part isn't so; but the subtlest part is not with the softest thing as was previously mentioned; and that which is similar to the Caiad [a type of surgical instrument] like you said before is more obtuse than any others.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 "When the ulcer swells and enters into the intestine, at that point one must reduce it back to its original shape within itself in its own place if possible, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 "When the disruption is broad below the stomach, then you should cause vomiting to release it from its back towards itself.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 "And if it is above the stomach, then place his head and elevate his chest higher than its lower part.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 "And similarly if it is a disruption of both parts below the stomach, then place your intent and your consideration always here for it so that the part containing the ulcer should be higher than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 "And thus you must administer this to both large and medium ulcers.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 "For small ulcers, place it according to what has been prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 "Then make sure that the present one is placed in your hands so as to be a more efficient minister of the whole disruption while keeping its mouth wide open.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 "Then take away from him who follows sutures one after another, and this is the common mode of sewing for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 "And it should be so that you take care to receive it with both hands or count its size according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 "Then subtract the amount from the hands of the surgeon as a doctor does, except that you must stretch out one thread between two cuts on both sides with both ends over the inside and then make it penetrate into another part until you have reached four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 "Then tie with double thread around both parts at the same time and then gather together two flaps of the ulcer neatly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 "Then subtract its size with both hands and then tie another knot in them also after this thread as you did the first one.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 "Therefore you must not make incisions with that which causes pain when applied to the parts of the body where itching occurs, until complete cessation from constriction.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The middle of the needle is between thickness and subtlety; for the needles are sharper and easily penetrate meat; but the thick ones are difficult to enter into the wound due to this.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 "It is not desirable that the needle be placed very close to both sides of the skin; so as not to penetrate flesh easily and open up before the completion of its own wound, and also not to extend after suture has been applied, lest it prevent the wound from closing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 "Next strike the extremity of the needle so that they do not fall off when placed on his body; and place them from all sides with a little piece of linen held by both ends of it: and remove them as soon as you know the wound has been closed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 "This is a more convenient way to sew when using needles with fewer points.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 "Since one or two needles are enough for sewing them, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 "The second way of sewing is common; to make the stitches with four sides as follows: four sides, two cuts and two slits in one piece, each with an equally fine thread between thickness and subtlety.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 "Then when you have penetrated with the four sides of the needle, remove it from the part to which it was attached and make a thread tight at the upper part of the wound; so that there is sewing as in clothes being sewn together, placing an amount between all stitches according to the lesser thickness.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 "This kind of sewing people know how to do.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 "And with this kind of sewing I did my wound that happened by the sword inside my thigh; it was made when I was wounded together with a tool and there was disruption to the hand as big as one palm; and outside from the middle of the belly two palms from the middle part of the belly, and there was disruption in the middle of the bowels.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore it was necessary to remove a part of his intestines through an opening in 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 It was necessary to make an opening and wait for 15 days before removing a part of his intestines; I operated on him during that time and he recovered well; it has been many years since then, continuing to live in good health, accustomed to his circumstances.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 The doctors thought he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I was able to remove it with the ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because there was no unguent where I was working and nothing from the medicines available.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore, I bathed his wound with a mixture of water and honey every day for two days until he was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I call the two types of sutures mentioned in the following story.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And one is to use a sharp suture: it goes inside from the outside towards the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle penetrates into the wound and comes out through the same point as it entered from outside towards the inner part; release the loop at the end of your hand where you introduced it, so that another thread may penetrate to the other side starting from the inside towards the outside in a different spot.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have done the first one to penetrate, then do the second one according to this; release the end of your thread where it emerges from outside towards the inside and make a new penetration starting from the other side towards the outside until both are completed
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 After that begin also on this side with the same thread and proceed as before with the end of it at the other hand where you introduced it, until both are completed.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 After that, remove the thread from this side and its end where you introduced it; proceed as before with the other hand until both are completed and then one by one and then the others: continue like this until all parts have been penetrated according to the same example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The suture of this incision is that you must sew the skin around the wound with stitches; in such a way that you remove part of it from one side and leave another part to heal by itself on the opposite side, until both are healed
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of suture mentioned is Gale's
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 The following passage describes a type of suture used in surgery, as described by Gale; it is performed similarly to how certain medical practitioners sew together the parts that are brought near one another due to nature: they apply the ends of the stitches to the opposite ends and then connect them with each other.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this type is performed similarly as I described it to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is permitted that you bring the opposite end of the wound near to the inner part and then make it penetrate into it alone; after this, remove both ends with stitches.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 After that, return to the first step and make it penetrate from the outer part into the inner part using both ends with stitches; after this is done, remove them all.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 After that, return to each of the two steps and make it penetrate from the inner part towards the outer part with both ends using stitches; after this is done, remove them all.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And that type of suture is superior to the common one in terms of speed and efficiency, and it is the method used by those who have forgotten their previous method.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 That is therefore Gale's method.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some people said that it was better to use the other type of suture mentioned earlier, which has no specific name given in this passage.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The suture used on the inside is done with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 It is that you introduce one of the threads into both of them; and begin with inserting one needle from what I told you earlier, then make it penetrate until the other end comes out in accordance to how they sew together their eyebrows equally well.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And you know that when there is a disruption inside the suture, then it becomes more difficult than in any other part of the body to repair it.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of wounds is more important than that of ointments
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 Because when you have treated a wound with its own blood before it dries out and you remove the intestines along with it and treat it, then place it on top of a heated surface for drying.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already dried out the wound, then place it on a certain ointment that you have in your possession and let it heal without any pain or itching: until they stop flowing, soften up the tissue, and calm down.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards the treatment should be just like that for treating other wounds so it can heal completely.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if you do not have any medicine present, then place it immediately on top of it and quickly start emitting pus with a tool like that which you use to treat yourself so it can be treated twice within the day as much as possible until it heals completely.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 However, if there are many wounds nearby when a simple one is present, you should not search for another medicine to bring in more variety because that would waste time and resources.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If a wound communicates with another part of the body and it is close to an artery or vein, then you should put the affected limb into hot olive oil to be warmed up until it can no longer move freely.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain or itching (which often happens), then apply a plaster with wine vinegar, soothed by black pepper and heated until the putrefaction is expelled from its intestines: especially if the putrefaction has already set in and an exit penetration occurred all the way to where the poison entered.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 You know that when something has come out of a large intestine, it is easier to heal than if it came from the smaller ones; and vice versa, it is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The part of the intestine that is called the jejunum does not heal from a wound in it at all; and because of its multitude which comes out through them, and their magnitude (which means how much matter they expel), and because of the subtlety of its body structure, and closeness to its own nature's nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 "If this procedure came from a wound it is necessary to reduce [to heal] the swelling by reducing its length according to your method of equalizing intestines when you cut them up equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "But if you do not have a wound or it is already done with an injury, then proceed to apply the bandage over that spot where a vein has been cut through from him [the patient], so as not to let any blood flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 "Inside the swelling there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 "Then cut the ligament that is above it [the swelling], and attach two ends of thread from below your wound outside him [the patient]. So as to let go of his pull downwards and extraction at the spot of the swelling, and emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 "Remember that it happened inside your intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 "When the disruption happened inside your intestine and it was small: then it is possible to restore in some people because I heard of someone who had a wound on his own body from a lance and there was a wound at the right stomach [right side] and it has healed: and the fistula has been made, and the discharge has occurred from him.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 "I therefore put my care until I was not cured of his disease neither did I cease to gently touch him [the patient] until he was healed and the place became solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 "After I had heard the place become solid, I feared that a bad accident would occur on top of his weakened body and it did not happen to him [the patient] from the bad accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 "And he regained his health better with food and drink, and became strong, and entered the bath [water], and trained himself on a healthy diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 "And some doctors said when the disruption happened inside your intestine and it was small: then it is necessary to tie it [the patient] up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 "It is that you will apply large bandages on their heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 "Then remove two lips with a knife and one from within them, put it into their mouth above the two cut lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When this is done over her, she will open her mouth and pull out her head from there with both hands, keeping it steady, for fear of falling off; but if it falls down or turns away then that would be the end of her.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 "Then remove a second one closely following the first, and stop cutting after removing it from above the cut lips.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 "Then reduce her anus.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 "If the head remains attached to the intestines, until it is eaten by the intestines, and treated with medicines that will not let go of its hold onto him because he was too weak.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 "It is also possible to tie the intestines with a thin thread; which has been taken from an animal and attaches itself into this opening.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 "...and it is so that you take the extremity of this thread out of the intestines and remove much flesh from it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 "Then tie up the end of its thread tightly into place with a thin thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 "...and insert this thread with him into his intestines...
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 "Then reduce her again to the first reduction.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 "...but it is only after removing with trust and care according to a certain way of faith and prudence...
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 "You know that which is large and broad especially if it is in a very thin intestine; then there's no strength to it but the subtlety of wisdom, not all its health.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 "...on the cure of ulcers and fistulas...
Caput LXXXVIII.	 "The eighty-eighth chapter.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 "You know that any ulcer which does not heal and become a scar is called an fistula, no matter where it may be in the body; we call this one Ulcer of Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 "And a fistula is the filtration of knots hard or soft and white; without which there is no pain, but with it is there comfort from one's hands.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 "It is in certain hours that are humid and emit pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 "However moisture may be found in some of these hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 "Sometimes the humidity is abundant and thin; sometimes it is thick and smooth; sometimes it is delicate.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 "I have spoken of wounds that do not heal; neither are they formed in the flesh for no reason at all.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 "One cause is either due to the scarcity of blood within his body; or it may be because of its malice; or from an obstruction between him and the upper lips that is hard, preventing his life-giving spirit from entering; or perhaps a large number of sores with foul qualities; or he might have putrid matter in himself, causing material for bad quality to come out to him. Another cause could be unhealed wounds, where the remedy was neglected.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 "I have also displayed all these causes and signs to you with remedies; now it is necessary that I explain the method of treatment for Fistulae and Zuken.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 "So understand that a fistula has occurred in every part of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 "There are fistulas that connect to veins and arteries; or the nerves; or to the intestines; or to the urine; or to one of the back bones; or to a junction of the muscles composing them: just as the hand and foot do.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 "What else is there in these fistulas? It makes the cure for them very difficult; it does not receive treatment and neglects taking care of itself with its occupation being work and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 "If there is from one of these fistulas whose depth has not reached those places I mentioned; and if you are trying to treat it with faith; or trust in its treatment; then take hold of the skin around it with your thumb, or with a knife, depending on which fistula extends along its course. If it moves towards its proper direction, seize it firmly.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a fistula that is tortuous, then you should examine it with a delicate probe
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because of the leniency (gentleness) in handling one's body, and regarding the tortuousness
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If a fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible for you to examine her with forceps.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, from the mouths of these other openings, extract (remove) one of them using your own mouth.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 As you remove one opening with your own mouth, in moist conditions cause the remaining opening to move out.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then inquire as to the manner by which it is possible for you: whether there is a long fistula or short one, or both openings are close together and in one place; or if there is a single opening with multiple openings nearby, and this covers everything completely, using your strongest strength when asking about the pain of compression with your hand above where, and also examining it through signs and causes accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 After being positioned over all these, then proceed to examine her with confidence; and it is that you consider at this moment if there was a nearby fistula appearing, or if it has slipped away from union, or from the artery, or from one location, or from several locations which I told you about: at this point dry the fistula according to what was mentioned earlier in my narration, and take out of her what is inside through filtration, and putrefaction of the flesh, as a result of it being born in its opening with flesh, or the rupture, and many others. And care for her until she becomes healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If a fistula is of great depth and according to rectitude (correctness), then you should extract her with all the force that it is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse her with all the corruption on his body.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer the strong medicine until it reaches to the point where you comprehended her with iron; and let him do this frequently, until the corrosive medicine is completely eaten by the acute medicine that remains from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 "After cleansing with a mixture that restores health until it becomes healthy.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 "If the patient does not become healthy through what we applied before (the mixture), then cauterize [it] according to what was used for application.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 "If the cause of Fistulas is known to you (the patient), then check it with you and inquire about this: Then cauterize him according to what was shown to me: if he does not prohibit anything from a vein or artery, burn [it] using our method.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 "If it is discovered by you that there is some corruption or negligence within the patient and he has not completely recovered from this yet: Then cauterize him until he fully recovers.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "After cleansing with what brought [the patient] to health, until it becomes healthy.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 "If this did not become healthy and emitted pus as before, then you know that you did not fully eradicate the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 "Then seek further more deeply into this matter and inspect his cause with utmost diligence, also purifying him with your ultimate force (or strength).
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 "After cleansing.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 "If this becomes healthy then it is a good thing; if not, you know that the corruption has gone very deeply into his body and you have failed to overcome it.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 "Therefore there is no wisdom left for you except to let nature take its course alone.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 "If the patient has a fistula and it is possible for you, cauterize him with subtle methods that lead to this.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 "If there are many bones: then seek all the attachment of them one by one and do not let go anything from these with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 "If something contrary to your wishes arises from humidity and you are not afraid of cutting into them or making a mistake, then cut through those humilities and meats if they exist there, and release the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 "If you do not have the means to release their bones when it is your time (hour), then place over [the patient] what will rot him: and let go of him until he has rotted from around the bones and the humilities.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 "Hold wounds so that they don't solidify.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 "Sectional incision should be held fast, as you held it with your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 "Apply oil above the oil (ointment), if you have it; otherwise use another ointment's stick.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 "When the mentioned parts become rotten and separate from each other, their removal is made with a special tool; then they are attracted to one another.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 "If a tooth is large like the tooth of the heel or buttock (genital), as for those parts, it has become part; and then, when this last reason [is] given, blackness and corruption will befall that one.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 "Then restore the wounds.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 "If the one in it has become a large part and corruption is already taken up to the marrow of the bones, then it is necessary to fasten it tightly and strike all the way down to the place where corruption occurred; then care for it so that consolidation occurs.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 "And I will show you what happened to the knife in your hand; so that you may place it as a model and tool over your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 "He was young in age, about thirty years old, to whom pain happened to his arm due to the cause that went inside him and reached the body; that is, from within, until matter reached down to the shoulder, it was called a great betrayal.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 "Therefore time with his error and then when he opened up, many matters followed him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 "His care was set up until his hand reached the shoulder; and many openings were made in him; all of them emitted pus [and] body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 "Therefore he [the patient] was attended by many physicians over two years; and it wasn't in him a wise one with regard to the art of hands until someone called out to him, and heard his shoulder; and the matters that were after these openings came in great numbers: also all matter of body had become tabulated, and color on him was already yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I am trying to insert a needle into one of the openings (orifices) and it has reached the target.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 After examining all the orifices, I have inserted its point into itself from every side of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I have therefore succeeded, and pulled back the point of one of those orifices until it reached a part of its body: and I entered this corrupt one; for which is now corroded, and covered with black shit, and putrified, and perforated, so that it has penetrated up to the middle.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I have therefore seized what was detected by me from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I detached it, which was not on that bone except for its corruption, and I severed it off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 I have therefore removed her/it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the restoration on a long bench, accompanied by medicines and bandages.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it was not settled/bound up.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried with the second one above and beyond the first detection; and entered into its continuous corruption, accompanied by it/it on bone, and severed that which appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 And I have therefore sought the restoration of him/her/it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not restored./bound up.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Then I tried with it again and did not cease to insert the particular part; but I strove for its restoration; and it was not restored, until I made an incision from bone around one of its palms, and extracted that with its middle.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored him with medicines, and it was bound up quickly and became healthy; and this iteration in his operation was not necessary, except for the disposition of the weak, and the scarcity of his strength, and my fear over him from death: because he used to fall on every side by the excess removal of syncopic evil.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 And he became healthy through whole restoration; and flesh hard on the bone was made, and a good arrangement of his body was done; and its strength returned to him; and in disposition were set/established; and no contrary state came upon him while walking or movement injury, by any means.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If the swelling has already occurred at the site of the body part, it is necessary to secure it as follows; first you must grasp and hold onto the swollen area using your hands in such a manner that you are able to stretch out the swelling by pulling on it with both hands from the top. After you have stretched it towards the top, gently apply pressure at this point until the swelling subsides completely.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then secure the swollen part onto your body above it and extend its extremity so that you can pull the meat towards the lower part; then grasp the meat in front of the place where you want to tie it down, so as not to let go of the tied-down flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Use a stick or a collar beneath the lower part of the body so that when you do this it is not allowed to slip off the spoiled flesh
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary to have the tie above the spoiled part so that it does not slip off with the help of your hands and also prevents any slipping or sliding on its own side as well as preventing you from tying another knot right next to this one.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the swelling is spoiled and not swollen yet but is about to become swollen then you should continue grasping it along with a portion of it; the corruption or injury will be in the middle of it or in one of its parts, at that point grasp all around the body part completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then use a stick beneath it.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 After securing the first part with a corruption on it you must continue to secure it from another side until the tie is made according to its length and as we previously said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption or injury is at the junction then cut off that junction of it; and secure the swelling from another part as we previously said.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 If the corruption or injury is at a place between two connections then there should be no intention except for an incision in that part.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption or injury is at a place between your hands and feet then there will be great difficulty
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 It is necessary that you understand how it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And when you are able to grasp it in whatever position or way is possible for you and with every kind of ingenuity that is corrected to your mind; but if it does not do something contrary to the vein or artery then do not let go of it.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 The incisor teeth and the molars to cut into these bones are many, depending on their position in relation to each other, and preparation of them and the nature of them, and their sharpness and size, and their strength, and rarity
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore it is necessary to bring together all the tools needed for that specific surgical procedure.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And you know that these operations will show a greater significance in front of an instrument whose edge is sharp when you are intently focused on its sharpness.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 The knowledge of the modes of this art is a witness to their eagerness; for at that point you will have come across what was made by them with all their tools towards every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I will be firm on the number of instruments you put together that strike with them and the trial over others which you will practice.
Forma Serrae.	 The shape of molars
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Shape of another molar.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of a different molar.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of a different type of molar
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 These shapes are best placed for their use.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let the edge of his hand be sharp as steel and its handle like a bowstring; let it be made in pyramidal fashion for better use.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The shape for joining together two rasors
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasor should be shaped according to the star-shaped form of a spear tip; its points should be shaped according to the shape of the points I showed you earlier.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it will not work unless when they are joined together their heads move against each other as if in a fight and the mouth is large and strong.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The larger rasor shape.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Shape of a medium sized rasor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Shape of a rasor with wide blades.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 A shape for one where the gap between the blades is narrow.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 A different type of rasor with thin edges.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Shape of a rasor with curved extremities.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of grasping tweezers
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form for grasping bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Large-grip form of tweezers.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles the Radio, and thus is as if it were a lever: displaying from bones many reasons [or causes].
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Tweezers with which it coincided that of its perforation was made on the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 His extremity triangular, sharpness of extremities.
Fit ex Indi.	 Fit from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly should be like it that all we have mentioned as reasons for the tweezers and scissors may be performed with these [tweezers].
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 About the cutting of extremities and serration of bones
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter Eighty Nine.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 The extremities become putrefied: either from an external cause or from within.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Since then you are to be treated by the physicians of the corruption with their medicine, and not provide care: and let that the corruption falls on the member as it did nothing: then it is necessary for you so strike at this same member up to where the corruption follows until death or malice which is greater defect in the body.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign to which it fell is that member degraded until the end [the sign of degradation]. Until then let he ignite him or decay after death: until that corruption follows that same member and creeps through all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore with the cutting of him and similarly if the cause of corruption is by percussion through all his weapons as scorpion to sea, and to a people, and a net, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the corruption or percussion is on the extremities of the fingers then strike at the finger and not be from the other corruption until you reach the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it was to the hand then strike at that with the root of a needle and not be from the other corruption until you reach the arm of the needles.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 Remove arm from above and strike it at the joint where you make your incision
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If a corruption occurs while passing through, then seek him around the elbow; there he is deathly sick
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 To administer beyond that with care's help
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do from the foot when a corruption occurs in the finger, then strike it at one of its joints; and if the blow strikes your finger to the joint of the foot, then strike off both feet.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it ascends to the knee, then strike below the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 However if a corruption has already occurred above the knee, there is no escape but to dismiss and release the sick man.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And how you strike a member or fasten him up is to bind it with the lower cord and strike off there; and with another cord above place
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And when extending one's hand downward, bind it with a lower cord and fasten him up there; and when extending the other upward to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the meat that is between two cords with a strong pull downward until the whole flesh is separated.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then strike or bind up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 It is necessary that you place the linen blanket around all sides and it does not touch any of the good places; and put on a cold dressing after an added injury and anointing with oil.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If you have a bleeding internal from within during the operation then burn up or apply pressure to the wound immediately; or put above those shedding blood and place them aside.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until completion.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if the member is injured with a cord fasten it up and care for it until healing occurs.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 I will tell you what happened from striking your finger; the same happens when striking yours.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 That is because it happened to his finger with a blackening and the accompanying burning; and the corruption first struck him by striking his own finger until it began to strike off his foot completely.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 The surgeon therefore cut off the finger as it had become corrupt and painful to him due to his injury; he cut through this at the junction of its tendons, and so it was cured
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a certain period of time had passed, he experienced the same corruption to his finger on his own index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 He then came to me and expressed a desire to recover that excess of fluids which he had placed upon his hand after the completion of his body's treatment; but it was not reabsorbed, and so he started to flow out into another finger until the corruption spread throughout his whole hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He then came to me with the intention of cutting off his hand; and he did not want this excess which flowed from him after the treatment of his body, hoping that it might be reabsorbed by me - but I was afraid as well for fear that there would be death at his own incision.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the surgeon's virtue was beyond measure
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he had come to me for this purpose and cut off his own hand, he returned back to the ground; and came back to me because of it, since he desired to do so - and then he cut through his whole hand until cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And do not twist this story so that it serves as a guide for what has fallen into the category of these evils - and let its meaning be conveyed according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Of the cure of the hand with the quality of healing using medicines.
Caput XC.	 Ending
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When the abscess in some of his members has been protracted and is drained by the surgeon; thereafter it breaks off or perforates, and there remains a place which looks like pus - and the skin over that as if he had just emerged from being sewn up - but does not reach to the end in its corruption nor prints into the mouth nor into the anus nor into the ligaments: it should be called a sinus; although if the duration of the space is prolonged until a perforation occurs, then by this it may become fistulae.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 His task is to cut off completely as though it was burned; and particularly when it's subtle, like a thread; And when you bind it with confidence because of the fear that you would have lost by mistake from its place due to the impurity
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If the skin adheres to a blade, and does not result from that injury, the last consequence is death; if there is pus from the wound, then you should seek a barber to treat it; And when he examines him with a cleaver
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is big and pus comes out from it, the smell of death arises; then you should shave him with a razor to treat it; And when he examines him with a cleaver
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Finally, take from him what is necessary for you; and dissolve it with water and honey, shave him with a razor to treat it; And bind up the opening of his wound, and release the medicine given to you according to the two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Finally take him out with an expression; do this for days until the odor of death is removed and it is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And when you shave him with water and ashes, if the medicine is not present to you; and it is necessary for you to take firewood or charcoal, and pour over them water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Finally cleanse him with her, shave him with the ashes until he believes that the nose is clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If tolerance is not present over the medicine of ashes, nor water and honey; then shave him with water and honey as before, mixed with something from resin.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or shave him with honey and wine mixed; because of the property of the bees it will cleanse, and remove impurities from his nose; And give him wine to come off as he pleases when there is excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do this repeatedly until he believes that the injury to his nose is far removed; then shave him with what makes flesh grow on it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 "It is necessary to soak the abscess with a solution of vinegar and rose oil, and apply wine as well; or you may soak it with some medicinal ointments, depending on which one suits best.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the sinus is narrowed so that no cannula can be inserted through it, then you must widen the cavity by using iron rods; or you may apply a paste of Egyptian ointment and balsam as well, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly if the cavity has already been enlarged, you must close it again with sutures; and remove as much of whatever is inserted through it without any additional materials.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly if the cavity where the discharge comes from is very narrow, it has been dried out to the top; then you must apply a remedy of lower pressure in that location inside the sinus itself so that the discharge flows downwards, because when pus coagulates at the bottom of the sinus, it prevents meat being produced there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible to dry out the sinus from below as described above; then you must stop applying remedies so that a membrane can be prepared and the discharge flows through with help, after having been prepared for you in advance.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 When applying remedies, make sure nothing other than discharge is retained inside; and take the solidified medicines which are placed above the sign, along with what you need.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And stretch them over the linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And make sure the linen is of sufficient quantity to allow for complete communication through the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then strike with a rod at the direct opening of the sinus; widen that opening of the sinus further.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then stretch over the linen with another rod according to the size of the opening; and place it upon him in a long position above the sinus opening so that his discharge may flow out through the discharge from there; but you will not use a large linen unless after several days one is used.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 That one who is above the opening of the sinus, that one whom you remove at all hours so that it may return to where it has been collected from pus; and so you know, if this thing which flows out through it is much or little: whether digested or not.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 "And having considered this spot further, the master of that place felt his pain, or if there was no pain in it he would not be able to endure it and therefore become insensible.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 "And if your treatment is done with such care and the mother of what has been poured over that opening becomes clear, then you know that this place will stay on until it falls off or parts away: so therefore put a strap around him one day or another, or when he has finished his urination, change the cloth for another and wash the wounds.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 "If the discharge from your place is very long and subtle, then you do not need to worry about it falling off because his treatment will approach him; for there are men who make the generation of flesh in their veins slow-moving, and those who drive against them.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 "If discharge from your place is many days long and remains undigested, then you know that the opening will not stay on.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 "So if the time for discharge is long and the rest of him remains so as well, then you should give them medicine to excrete their urine and let doctors do it with a wet towel, using water that has been boiled: just like when an unguent is added while there are excessive additions from urine.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 "And at the end of your treatment when you put on the unguent dyafinicon and it is rinsed with boiled oil: and afterwards there should be poured over him an equal amount of old wine from his own substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 "Then wrap him up tightly after all that, and use him immediately.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 "And this is similar to the treatment when there was no unguent dyafinicon for you at that moment: after he has been washed until it becomes full and used.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 "Or take myrrh and aloes too, and olive oil; put on everything and wash it while you are over fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 "Then tie a cloth around him and put it over the place; and tie with that cloth what you washed; until it becomes full: and wash it with water, and then put on the cloth again.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 When this long Aristolochia is administered, its heavenly lily roots and the flower itself are obtained; and the herb's flour, the Centaur's tail.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 For simple use (take) them separately or mixed together; and make a mash from the roots themselves; and grind it into meal that you may eat from it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the sinus (of a patient) is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment; then you know that corruption has already taken place within it; or may have made an impression in the bones, muscles, ligaments, etc.; at that point, care for him as if he were suffering from fistulas.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 The cure of ulcers and fingers; the incision of the digits added to it, and the sectioning (of flesh).
Caput XCI.	 Chapter 100
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 An ulcer is an opening that occurs under the thumb or toe of a hand or foot; and often arises on other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the matter is prolonged and not properly cared for by the ulcer; or the ulcer turns into a boil that emits pus until it has corroded its root; often this turns completely black, causing corruption to occur in his mouth as well. And if the extremity of the finger becomes necrotic, i.e., dead; then he loses control over him and he is unable to use him any longer.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you cure him as we advised earlier, and do not fail to give your full attention; then it is necessary that you strike off with the iron any remaining excess from his finger.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 After this, cauterize the ulcer
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 The cautery is an instrument of healing.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If his mouth is healed and also his finger; the excess water from his finger will be compressed into flesh on the inside, he will begin to feel pain in him again; then you must apply a small amount of radium beneath an angle that has been puncturing flesh and drive him up towards it: and strike off at once all that remains after being burned by medical compounds or corrosive substances.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 "In order that [the healing process] may be done with ointment.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 "If a corruption has already set in, then you should strike out that mouth and remove it; otherwise [the corrupted material] will never be healed while still within the affected part.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 "If you see a corrosion or corruption affecting the finger, then remove it from one of the fingers that remembers its memory; [i.e., if the affected finger is remembered by another finger.]
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Afterwards heal him.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 "If the finger is injured or broken, then let it be first attended to by a phlebotomist [one who performs bloodletting].
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 "Afterwards dry the finger with an acute cut made from above downwards.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 "And let the cut be kept from reaching any part that is under the finger; otherwise it will cause great pain to the limb as a result.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 "Afterwards heal the place where he sits [i.e., where the healing process has been performed].
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 "The fingers are the most useful of all members among men; [and] some have bones and others only a finger; and there is one who has his life bound to certain digits.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 "He [i.e., the person] who is born into some of the digits, will not die; and he who is born at a finger-binding place will be saved.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 "Those whose bodies are so [i.e., the bodies to which this passage refers] have cuts easy to make.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 "This is what you should do when making a cut on his own finger with an acute blade.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 "The cure of those who have their lives bound to certain digits [i.e., the person] will be difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 "Therefore let there be a restraint from cutting him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 "If the person is born into one of the last digits, then you should strike out his flesh with a blunt blade from below upwards to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 "In order to cut these tools with one's own sword.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Afterwards apply the remedy.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 "The consolidated injury is often difficult to heal, especially if it occurred due to a fall of the human body or by heat from fire.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 "Therefore, in order that the consolidated injury may be separated once again according to its own original shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 "After this has been done with the appropriate oil or bandages soaked in olive oil to prevent them from sticking together and separate them; either use a thin strip of lead to bind them back together once again according to what ought to be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 "And similarly if the consolidated injury occurred due to a blow with a palm, then dry it off and restore its shape according to what was prepared.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 "Regarding the treatment of a broken bone.
Caput XCII.	 "Chapter 22.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 "The veins that are torn and injured with too much melancholy humor and the result is bleeding from many parts of the body; especially on the arms, face, hands, and feet.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 "Therefore it is necessary to administer a strong emetic for treating excessive vomiting from black bile many times over.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 "Afterwards, the procedure of taking blood from the patient in order to draw off black bile is done on the right arm just below the elbow.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 "The cure for them with iron, it can be done according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 "One way is for them to bleed by using a lancet and remove the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 "Another way is for you to draw off the whole vein and remove it completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 "The procedure of cutting off their head according to this method must be done carefully.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 "Firstly take a warm bath with hot water until the large amount of blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 "Afterwards tie down his feet to above his hips and from below his knees to the upper part of his leg with wet cloth so that he does not move.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 In a single vein or two veins or three veins spread out
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then you must first extract blood from the hand near the groin using one vein or two veins and then proceed upwards until you reach the top, after which you should apply the tourniquet to the upper arm for the patient who needs it first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then you should withdraw blood until a sufficient amount has been obtained from the hand up to its lowest point and according to the strength of the patient.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards bind her tightly so that she does not drink from the night-dealing spirits and vomiting and phlebotomy when necessary until a vein is found, at which point you should stop to avoid harming the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The extraction of his blood will be according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the arm if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then insert him into the bath; or you could warm his arm with hot water until he starts to bleed, and then apply pressure on the veins; or if there is no present vein perform a forceful massage that will heat up the member (I assume this means the arm).
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then you should dry him off directly from one vein along its length; or at his elbow or near the calf depending on where there is dryness (I assume this means veins).
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then gently remove the bandage from all sides until it is visible to the senses; and you should look for where she bled at her elbow or near the calf so that you can lead her towards the night-dealing spirits.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 Therefore after removing from his bandage gently wipe him off as if he was almost clean.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert beneath the radiator until when she is extracted and held in by the bandage; bind her tightly with a blindfold gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then dry another nearby three fingers away from that area.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then gently remove the bandage from the upper part one at a time until it becomes visible (I assume this means remove each section of bandage one by one).
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then extract her with the radiators as you did before and bind her tightly after that just like you did first time.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 "If you need another incision (cut) elsewhere on his body or multiple incisions if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 "After that, make the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 "Take it out and perform the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 "After that, take it away from the upper incision or any other incision you may need to make, until you have performed all of them completely; then perform the final incision.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 "If it cannot be removed from the upper incision or any other incision, then introduce a double-edged knife and tie it securely with cord; take out this one as well, either you go under it on the radius of your hand: otherwise turn to the opposite part [of his body], until everything is done.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 "And so, no incision should be made.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 "If an incision is made, you will find it very difficult to remove the blade from its place and return it safely above the affected limb.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "When you have taken out everything completely, then put the wound-dressing over the place where the limb was cut and apply oil or ointment to it; if the latter is better, cure him.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 "If the veins are contracted and twisted around so that they cannot be pulled out in one piece according to our description of their path or order: then it is necessary that you find a way to reach them all over his entire limb and remove the places where there were incisions.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 "After that, tie it securely with cord until you remove the whole of it; and when you have performed your incision above this one, do not make another one, for it will be very difficult to remove from its place or take out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 "Therefore use prudence in everything you do.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 "Shape of the incision where he is treated.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 "The shape for cutting open a vein.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 "It is not as curved or acute a vein, and it does not go to the end of that part; but rather it has a large bend and length which makes it easy to remove from its place.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 Extraction of veins from the leg
Caput XCIII.	 Extracting veins from the head is a more advanced technique that requires special tools and expertise.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated from the leg and on hot soil, like a lizard, and on arid soil that is warm but barren, without any vegetation or trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And sometimes veins may also be found elsewhere in the body outside of the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 The generation of this vein is through the decay that occurs beneath the skin, like how snakes and fleas become generated inside the body.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 The sign of its extraction is when inflammation occurs on the leg veins from a severe heat.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the location for its removal must be determined.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein will begin to exit from that location of extraction like a root or an animal part.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When this becomes apparent at the end of that part or root, it is appropriate to close off a small hole in order to hold water until you reach the second and third holes from there (i.e., where the lead enters). And if the lead falls out of the vein into the body then you must remove it from the leg by using a drachm scale as much as two and a half drachms, all the way up to the next hole at the bottom of that vein or root.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Therefore, if anything comes out of it through this small part into the water below, you must plug that hole shut right away to keep from letting any more lead out or fall out with a seal made of wax and pitch.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it has become much longer than this part allows for, then you must cut off that part of the vein itself and plug up the rest of it to keep any more lead from coming out with a seal made from wax and pitch or some other substance.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not cut off that root before all of it has been extracted completely, unless you want to be cutting up parts of your own body while trying to remove the lead from within veins and roots in a dangerous situation where there is little time for careful work.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 If you cut it off, however, and if the lead falls into the body with that action then a wound will occur at that place, decay of flesh will also be present along with that infection (ulcus means ulcer or sore), making for bad news all around.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 "He should be carefully drawn out, and extracted quickly, so that he returns to his original state, without leaving any trace of him within the body; and from this vein there is one taken which goes into certain people, namely five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And then he was brought to me because his right arm had been cut off at five palms
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If you are to be operated on at a certain time during your medication; then lead him into the cavity of his body with great force and perforate it from head to toe, until you have completely evacuated what is in her because of the matter: And administer putrefaction and decomposition to the location where he was placed for a period of days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then attend his care with great attention.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many windings, especially when it appears near the foot of a man, or at his own foot; and they are made for him many openings, and are taken from all of them by one winding.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore take great care of it as we said before about the division, with what has been removed.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Of a removal beneath many worms in the womb, and is called "the vein of the liver".
Caput XCIIII.	 Head 44
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This is called "the vein of the liver" among us on earth at Aegritudo bouina; because it has been struck by many worms and is very thin in relation to its birth, born between the womb and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It is given to the body whole, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the sense of a man while walking from one part of his limb to another, until its course has gone through every part of the womb, or until the course is complete in the middle of the body and it is taken.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the corruption of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes are struck beneath, so the legworms (roundworm) and hookworms at the womb.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 When he himself had inserted into the body and was lifted to the head, and settled at a place; then surely opened up there, and returned, and destroyed the eye; and fell that one many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Because of which he cared for him, and brought it out from there; then only that happens to him, except when outside of his movement, an appearance is given to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 So it may happen, so you are bound what is above him and below him with a strong tightening tie.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry up from above him, and brought him out of that.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the body, but not within you; then set up above the place with a cautery and fire, until he may die.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater what is feared, damage to him, which corrupted his eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you want it already from head towards the eye, then bind below on him above eyebrow tight.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry up from above him, and brought him out of that.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 It is necessary so that the weak one becomes made sick with its own body, by the remedies of medicines dead evil things.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let it happen to him from food and drinks who generate decay.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 From the incision above the Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Head of XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This Nakir is called in our land, and it is pain that was inflicted on certain members; then goes from the member to another member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself already heard this one, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I am summoned by a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And he gives his arm out, and heard the swelling of the forearm in a rope of an arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 After the time of one hour remained, he heard a swelling to fall with fire, as it fell from wounds; going up towards his arm or place where you can be; so that is like gold flowing, when it runs from location to location.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain therefore recedes from that place and is fixed in the arm.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 After a short time has passed, it falls off the end of the body onto the forearm, so then it drops into another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 It was handed to me since he fell completely within his own body as I had heard.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I am amazed therefore by the transfer of its place from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 But I, in turn, had not witnessed this manner of gentleness with my eyes before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However many others had witnessed the transfer of pain from one limb to another, but I did not see it with my eyes like I saw him in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 But I do not consider this to be the case unless it is because a woman was among those who are detected by signs of their sick bodies, so therefore there appears to my mind that feeling transferred from one limb to another.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 It is necessary for them not to appear according to this reason among those who are delighted and of the bodies of men, hidden from sight.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Since you are caring for him and he is a patient suffering that pain, then if it appears before your eyes as I described earlier, then hold it above his body and beneath him too until the transferred feeling returns to its normal state again; in this way it can be cured of its affliction and place will be restored.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see him with your eyes: then care for him along with an excision of the body and what expelled feelings, and drive away those with poisons from the breasts of women, and poison pills also, as well as others similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 On extracting arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 The end of book 66.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are divided according to their kinds and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their diversity is because some of them have large points and blunt ones, hooks or broad heads.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 These are those things that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 and from them come languages
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And from these comes the stars
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Those veins that are divided into parts where they fall down have two modes according to them.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 However the parts of the veins are divided into main partitions as in the case of brain and heart etc., similarly the veins of liver, spleen, intestines etc.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 If therefore a certain member of the body falls down and shows you signs of death as I tell you after, then it is necessary for you to cut out the arrows from those veins as cause of his death was in that place because he was in multiple positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 However when the arrows are not visible to you and have already been cut off from deep in a member then take out them immediately so that it is seen as a wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 The arrow to the brain when it falls into that is an arrow which penetrates the eye and causes sight loss and vertigo and redness of the eyes and inflammation of the tongue and spasm and mixing of the mind and cholera death
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 Perhaps blood will be extracted from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 Perhaps speech is lost and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 Perhaps it causes a white discharge from the nostrils similar to mucus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And an exit with similar water loss of limbs.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore you see those signs then refrain from the treatment and take out the arrow if it is not extracted.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The arrows to the heart when they fall into are: that which is close to the left breast and feels as if it were fixed on a hard thing but not on a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 The arrows may be like movements similar to those of the pulse and run out from the wound black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 It follows with a severe chill in extremities and cold sweat and syncope (seizure).
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Therefore, death comes near doubt
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And when the arrow of Sagittarius pierced the lung, death came from blood spurting out through the wound: and those who follow behind are cut off, and their bodies change color due to injury
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And death takes away great breath as well, high up: seeking the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 When the arrow falls into a man's chest, that is when death comes quickly near at his back, and great desire for breath with pain strikes him as he gasps, and all limbs move in death.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into a man's stomach, then quickly it will come from the wound by food to something unchewed.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If an arrow falls into the windpipe and sticks there, then it will come from that wound to something of excrement or vomit which has already been disrupted.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore no hope for him is there in his care nor the arrow's extraction.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If an arrow falls into the bladder and comes out urine: it proceeds to something outside of that, and the pain is greater upon the sick person; then you know that death will come soon.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 After all the limbs of a man have fallen away according to many dispositions as mentioned before when Sagittarius did not pierce an artery or vein: and the arrow is not successful
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you that which I heard of these arrows so as to signify it for your care.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 It was because one eye of him was killed by the arrow at his lacrimal canal and nose root
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore he took that out of one other side under the ear of him, and was healed, and did not come to his eye any more harm.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 Therefore he took another arrow which had killed him at the eyebrow of his eye under the lower eyelid: and that arrow was hidden, and I did not take it off except for a little part of his limb with which it adhered to his wood, because that arrow held on strongly in its bow, being made of iron, without any ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jewish man is healthy and has not suffered a misfortune at his eye's level
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 He extracted another arrow from the gut of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arabic and is in his ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I pulled him through the two guides; he was already submerged in his gut.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I became subtle with her and when I extracted her out of there she became healthy again; becoming a Christian too.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 He extracted another arrow that had entered his belly and we pondered because of its death; it was about to die from it
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days passed over him nothing had changed about his disposition; I pulled the arrow out from where it was and the intelligence of my mind with her and extracted her; he became healthy again and did not suffer a misfortune at his eye's level
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 I heard of the man who had an arrow in his back; he was cured because it was pulled out.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years the arrow left his heel.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I heard of a woman who had an arrow that entered her belly; the wound was healed over her and remained inside her but there was no change to her disposition and she did not suffer from any misfortune caused by her own actions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I heard of another man who had an arrow that entered his face; the wound was healed and remained there, not causing him much pain; these many are similar.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 He extracted the arrow of a king from his middle nasal bone; it had already descended towards his right side and was concealed altogether.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore, I called on his healing after the three days were over.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 But he did not die from the wound of the arrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 I spoke to him with subtlety and he did not hear me; but the same man was experiencing pain and torment beneath his ear from the right side
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 I pierced it (the arrow) at its extreme point
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I drew it out (the arrow) from the bandage where its virtue was contained and digested; trusting that the place where it had been removed would be shown to me, so that I could remove it myself: but did not fall at a place indicating where the arrow had fallen.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I persevered with the bandage on him for many days; and did not fall at a place indicating where it had fallen; but was healed of its removal in the meantime: and remained weak from having been taken out of his space during those days, until he felt an arrow one day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And told me that
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I placed the acute bandage on it for many days; until one day was open up: and when I tried to lift him gently with both hands, I felt a subtle extreme point of his arrow hidden within the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 After that I put on the acute bandage in opening of the wound; until one day we saw it clearly with both eyes, and he left me with him for a time period of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 After it had been enlarged and was possible for me to grip her with my fingers; and move her too, but she did not yield to being taken away: then I could no longer gently touch or try to lift her using the manner of children; until one day came when I grasped her forcefully with stronger tools, according to which form they had reached in the end of the chapter, until I took her away.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 After that I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And doctors say that cartilage of the nose is not restoreable.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored her and healed the wound and was healthy in health and whole again; no harm came to him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I told you the quality of extracting arrows some time ago, so that you put this rule and meaning above it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Although parts of this art and its distinctions are not comprehended with narration, nor is it comprehended by that book alone, but the wise craftsman compares them to little more than much; he compares what is present with what is absent, from which new operation arises, and a new instrument comes into play when they occur among things extraneous to this art.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I conclude that the arrows are not removed from the members in which they are fastened, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by an attraction from where it entered inside.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or on the contrary parts of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which is removed where it entered, or an arrow proceeding to a place of flesh; and it is pulled towards it, and it is removed.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 What if it does not lead to the exit at a certain time when it falls; then you must wait until that same arrow has died for several days, lest the flesh around him putrefy and cause his death: And will cease attraction towards him, and his exit from there.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if the arrow is embedded into bone and does not lead you to the exit; then immediately remove that one as well for several days until this arrow with attraction and movement every day no longer stays there.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 What if it does not lead you to the exit after a day; then you must remove from around him arrows of all parts with fine strokes skillfully until they become inflated.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then pull her out and remove her.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is firmly fixed in the skull of bone and has already proceeded into one vein of the brain; then abstain from attracting arrows, and remove her until it becomes equal to be with him after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if an arrow penetrates to the heart, death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in the bones of the body and does not penetrate all the way to the heart; it remains weakened for several days, and nothing happens by accidents from these; then the intention with attracting arrows and removing him.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 "If a fracture is fixed and will not yield to your manipulation, then apply the tongs (tibulae) around it as described above; thereafter treat the area as before until healing occurs.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 "If the arrow has already been extracted from its place within the body and is hidden or hidden away by touch; then examine her with your fingers.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 "If you feel it, then grasp it using certain instruments which are suitable for such an action of his.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 "If you cannot reach over it due to the constriction of your limbs and the length of the arrow in depth; there is no mouth or vein nearby so that you can grasp her, but only skin: then find around her until she enlarges her limb which will make it possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 "If you have ears which are bound up, then release the fixed flesh from all parts and with every ability that you possess it, as intelligence if your limbs cannot reach over her to fracture her ear or twist them; until this occurs.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 "And when you administer the extraction of an arrow wherever it is, then use the pressure of your hands with all parts; until this occurs: and finally in subtlety, so that she does not break apart, but there will be great difficulty for you to grasp her as well, and hers extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 "If you cannot reach over her from one side alone at first, then set her aside for several days until those around her are putrefied.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 "Then continue with her again; and let the tunic be loosened if she opposes you by a flow of blood, then administer what we mentioned from our chapter on care for the body: and take care to keep your strength intact from one incision or vein.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 "And administer every ability that is suitable for grasping the arrow in any way; and it will be with ease and tranquility or delay and firmness as described to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 "And there is the need that when you draw her back so she weakens according to the figure which was at the moment of arrow extraction; as it was before.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 "For it is more painful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If you are unable to do that yourself, then perform the task as shown in an illustration.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 A light that is drawn from the contrary part of one another or has already proceeded by it to something external: or does it cause a stiffness in the extremities of the Archer through a feeling out of the higher part of the skin, and you see its excellence clearly defined: therefore it should be cut off with a line following the quantity that can reach it with hooks.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw her out easily to come to an end.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If the Arrow is held on bone instead, then you should apply your hand according to its roundness until the Arrow is set into the bone and extends itself: after that draw her out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: then let her be released in a certain number of days; thereafter you will do the same to her until she is complete.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the Archer's wood is within it, then pull her along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 However if the Archer's wood has been cut off and you are to administer its impulse - then introduce an appropriate tool so that its fullness may enter into her [i.e., fit] and then pull her along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the Archer is fitted, then pull her out with an appropriate tool inserted into her.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The Archer is released through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the Archer's wood has been poisoned then you must cut off all of its flesh that contains venom - if possible do this
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then care for her with what matches it
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the Archer falls into the chest or the belly or the side or the thigh - and she touches by her tentacle what is near to it - then you can cut off above her if possible: after that let a hook take hold of her and draw her out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 And then apply your ointment, if you see fit, until she is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 This is the shape of a needle trap, which can be used for drawing arrows out
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The extremities are like the blade of a knife; when they grasp onto an arrowhead, they do not let go
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 There are various kinds of needle traps with different sizes and shapes based on the length and breadth of the arrowhead; they adjust to the strength and flexibility required for gripping it tightly and releasing it quickly.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a snare which is used to catch or hold something, often in hunting or fishing.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 The shape of a hook that can be inserted into an animal's mouth for capturing it, typically used in fishing and sometimes in hunting.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 These extremities are like a curved arm, so that on inserting them into the arrow, they can be withdrawn and then used to pull it back towards themselves
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The extremity of the snare is curved like a bird's beak, so that on inserting it into an arrow, one can be withdrawn out and then used to pull it back towards themselves.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 On the subject of phlebotomy for veins.
Caput XCVII.	 Section Seventy-Seven.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 The needles used for phlebotomy are thirty in number.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 These needles are six decads long; two for the veins behind the ears (the auricular veins); and then another two veins from each of the eyes, which are called the aspicientiae or "tears" veins. And one more vein is found on the face between the eyes. There's also a vein at the end of the nose
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 These needles have two guides for use with a guide-wire: one in the neck and another behind the ears.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 These needles are of two types, used in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 These needles have two types that are used at the lower lip of the mouth.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 These needles are called "Algeric".
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 These needles have two types used below the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 The veins used for phlebotomy are five in number throughout both arms.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 The brain is called the uppermost part of the skull
Et Fusca.	 and Cerebellum
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 And the cerebellum (also known as the "middle brain") is made up of two parts - one from the base and another from the top part of the skull.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And the cerebellum is placed at the back of the house (or base) and also called "titicollis" (meaning "little tail").
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 It is named as "the brain of the skull".
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 The brain stem (also known as the "funis" or "funicle") is placed above the eye socket and is that part where blood is drawn from a vein; it is also called "the one below which you see when pressing on your finger".
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 The salutation (or "salute") is placed between the annuli (or rings) and at its lowest point; it has two parts, one above and one below.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 It is present in the neck and foot each with three parts.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 The brain is below the finger, at its side (or base), from the top part of the skull.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 The second one is "sapeha" and its location is at the heel or ankle, coming out from the back side (or base).
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The third one is "nensee" and its location is at the ankle (or foot), also coming from the base side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And in the neck there are three similar parts to those mentioned above.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 About the drawing of blood from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 About drawing blood from two veins behind the ears; it is customary to perform this task with an old-fashioned tool, a pair of tweezers and a lancet for cutting open the vein at its base or top, but always causing damage to the head's scalp in the process.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 The quality of drawing blood from this source is according to how narrow it is.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It is necessary that the head be held gently and the neck of the vein must be gently squeezed with a good cloth to prevent it from moving around while drawing blood.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the veins will become visible as two pieces when the patient raises his arm and pulls back on the cloth holding them.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 In those ears are placed after the auricles in two depressions of the heads
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Seek therefore these ears with your finger and when you feel the pulse in them place a mark with ink
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 After that take hold of the phlebotomist's arm, and if he says 'Incidens' let him know.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 After that lead him down to a bed with arms outspread, so that the phlebotomist may approach you from below.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 After that take hold of your hand and place it upon his upper arm, and strike this with a stroke downward toward 'Incidens'.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 The length of the incision must be measured by the number of your fingers joined together, or around it, and remove from this as much blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 After that stretch out with a pulley, and then let go, so that they might be released.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And there follows the opening of this book on ears, and their cautery
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 Of phlebotomy in both arteries in time.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 Of the two arteries that are in two times of phlebotomy and the old one, and the fast one, and the most frequent one, it is to the eyes' sharp flow and excess flow
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 The quality of phlebotomy for them is according to what you have spoken.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 If a man is greatly sick then he should stretch his neck very much, so that the two veins may be clearly visible to you and there will strike the pulse of them under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then signs with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 After that take hold of the upper arm with your finger and lead the phlebotomist downward toward 'Incidens', then take hold of him at the top.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And strike with a stroke downward upon her as you did on two other veins, and let blood flow according to the amount of your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 After that break open the obstruction for him, place your finger upon her one by one hour by hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 With a knot at its base and a loop at one end, tighten it with an extremely strong cord (or something like that). And then release the knot to make him/it stand on his/its own two feet.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 Now let's remember what was said before and their incision as well as the extraction of the book at the beginning.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 After performing venepuncture on one side, proceed to perform cephalic vein puncture
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 The bandage on the arm after venepuncture is to be applied once the cephalic vein has been punctured and before moving or lifting an arm; it should cover any bruises, scratches, or wounds that may have occurred during the procedure.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 The quality of venepuncture is to be determined by how narrow you open your vein.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 The arm must be raised up off the bed until it appears one's head.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take an instrument called a foal or an apice.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Its form is like that of
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Take the instrument and place it at the top of the foal or apice (a small loop used for venepuncture) on your arm so that its sharp point is directed towards the cephalic vein you just punctured, either striking upwards through it directly with a pectine (a curved blade), or to one side in some other way. And then release it from the blood flowing out as much as possible according to the quantity of blood drawn.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then make a small incision near where you inserted the instrument, and tighten it so that your arm is supported in place.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And when venepuncture was made to one side.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However it is not necessary that the venepuncture be at the extreme point of the arm, as with other venepunctures made on both sides, in this case we should aim for a point on the opposite side.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 The venepuncture will be made on that side of the arm which is closest to you, unless it would make the instrument too sharp when it's very soft and flexible, in that case move across a little further.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Now let's remember how to perform venepuncture on both lachrymose veins.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The bandage on the arm after venepuncture of both lachrymose veins is to be applied when you leave your eye and wipe away any bruises or scratches from that area, and then cover it with a bandage after covering the eye itself.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 The quality of their phlebotomy is such that they raise (or pull) the sick man's head back with a stick
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Afterwards, the phlebotomist should place himself above his patient's head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 The phlebotomist must perform it downward and forward along the length of the stick, using a small quantity of phlebo [or perhaps phlem] on the end of the stick, so that he may not touch any part which is precious
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the phlebotomist's stick is too thin, it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 After that, draw out from his blood according to necessity.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place him above them and pull them up once at night and release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 The work of phlebotomy is done.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 Venous phlebotomy is a treatment for the fever and cold sweat that causes redness of the face, just as hemigration does [or perhaps, hemorrhage], especially when it is ancient [old].
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 The quality or effectiveness of their phlebotomy is such that they raise up the sick man's head with a stick.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Afterwards, hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin stick of phlebo (or perhaps phlem). Press the end of it into the middle of his ribs where you distinguished his nose according to its line
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 When one side does not show itself to him at that place because the blood starts flowing immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And you should take it from his blood according to your necessity with a little phlebo on the end of the stick.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 And pull her up once at night and release her.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 It will be restored immediately.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 The work of phlebotomy is done.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The other kind of phlebotomy is a treatment for the itchiness and itching in leprosy, melancholy sadness, jaundice, ulcers caused by worms or snakes, and corrosion of flesh from bites.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 The quality or effectiveness of their phlebotomy is such that they tie him up with a cord on both sides to his head and stay the artist above his head while he lies down under [his] belly.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 After making an incision at the length of the phlebotomy, it is wide
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Afterwards extract from the blood a certain quantity, either according to what you desire or as necessary
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Afterwards make in the same way with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 After that, tie a ligature on both sides of the middle third of the veins to prevent them from collapsing.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And let go at the beginning of it.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 Clean out the wound.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 The phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The equipment for phlebotomy by Albucasis is this: one puts a piece of cloth into the mouth and cleans out the tongue, wipes away the blood clot, cleanses out ulcers, makes cuts on the veins, makes cuts on the ulcers as well those in the nose and around his face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 The quality of the phlebotomy for them is such that you should do no harm to a sick person in front of you; and tie his neck with a rope.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Afterwards return to the mouth of him and look towards two veins; one is on his right hand, and the other on his left side; and demonstration by means of both sides through the darkness is done.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 It was like this: because there are small veins around them that are dark.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore, strike with one incision both sides.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt on your part and you do not know what those are; then intend towards a greater incision for them, and their more evident ones.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with two veins that are on the upper lip; and it is a custom to run down as much of him, because he has them on the lower lip as well.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 The phlebotomy after the cephalic veins in the throat.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 The equipment for the cephalic veins is this: one puts a piece of cloth under the tongue and cleanses out ulcers, cleans out phlegm from the throat, and cleans out the phlegm in the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 The phlebotomy procedure must be such that the patient lies between your hands and looks at the sun. Also, place one vein in each hand under his tongue; then you should gently close his mouth so he cannot see them with his eyes while you hold a finger over each vein to prevent him from seeing or tasting them.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Phlebotomy, therefore both of you: and guard that your hand not be held back by the patient while performing it.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 There are arteries below him; so there is a chance that blood may flow from them into his veins if he moves suddenly.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 From the two veins on each hand.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are used for phlebotomy, there being a custom among all men of using them.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And the phlebotomy procedure can be performed in two ways:
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 The first way is by cutting through the vein with a phlebotomist's knife to its side; or by inserting it into the body of the patient and gently closing his mouth so that he cannot see what you are doing while holding one finger over each vein to prevent him from seeing or tasting them.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is how they do it.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 In this manner the procedure for phlebotomy was established.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 The broad and narrow veins of these are as you see them: the procedure for phlebotomy is done with a broad one when there is room; but if not, then it's done with a narrow one like this, in order to make sure that he cannot see what you are doing while holding a finger over each vein.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 The procedure for phlebotomy was also established so that the veins which are open and visible may be used when they are convenient: large ones, those that contain blood in bulk; also those that are turbid or full of blood, according to their size and character.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 The phlebotomist is smaller than the broad one in terms of its breadth and the sharpness of its point.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 It was established so that the procedure for phlebotomy with a slender vein should be done when it is convenient: those that contain blood in a fine manner
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Of the large veins of the basilica
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The three major veins that are used for phlebotomy in the basilica are:
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 "From the veins of the chest and neck it draws blood; by following this vein to the mouth; when reaching it, let him take hold of a phlebotomist with both hands so that he may suck from her/it as much as possible, for beneath it is hidden an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If there is a mistake and the phlebotomy was performed incorrectly, then he will hit/strike her artery and blood will flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 So that the phlebotomist may suck from her with both hands; for this purpose [i.e., to avoid hitting an artery], let him be near/beside/close by.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Basilica does not appear [i.e., if there is no external guide to follow], then at that moment he must seek another one and exchange/transfer her to someone else, or ask for a second assistant; whatever you do, be sure to leave one of his arms with him so that he may continue working on the vein (the left arm).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 This is clear and straightforward; let her be sucked from by/with the phlebotomist as we have said previously [i.e., with both hands].
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If the phlebotomy is to be performed by/on this same assistant, then at that moment he must place his hand/arm in front of her so as to prevent/avoid hitting it; until you find a clear indication of where/when the pulse occurs [i.e., until you identify the point on her body where there is pulsation].
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 After placing his arm in front of her location/point [i.e., the point where pulsation occurs], then with the help of a marker and thread he will make an incision along that line to remove any necessary sections or cuts as we have previously mentioned with the phlebotomist Alnesil, as I said before.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful not to hit the artery by mistake/accidentally.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 When you have seen it [i.e., when you identify the point], with the help of the thread and marker you will inflate that area; if she has pulsation this indicates/means/shows that there is an artery present, so remove her at once/immediately/right away.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rise from the phlebotomy incision just as a child's urine does when it is full of water and the urine is sweet [i.e., if there are no complications], then you know that there is an artery present/presented at this point.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then press with your finger on it for a long time, and then lift off your finger
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is detached at that moment then tie off the arm with it and let it go down; and he who moves him will fall under his power.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move him for a certain number of days until he is cured.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood does not detach at that moment then you should strike him; and there is no present medicine to you now so as soon as an artery appears to you then cut it.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 His extremities will be detached and the blood will detach
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or if you take the fist bone and find him, or if a vein is found then take one meal-strip tie it over the fresh wound with good cordage, so that another day may be needed for its removal.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 When the blood has detached itself, this is good news.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not, then he should be cured with the memory of what preceded his detachment from blood vessels, and lifting off the blood itself is not difficult at multiple places due to a small opening in the veins, and the possibility that a cordage can be made out of an arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Of new veins
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The treatment of new veins is as follows; the blood is drawn from the upper part of the head and lower body through it because it has been made out of the branch of the basilica and cephalic trunk just like I said earlier.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And when removing him so that he is above his power from the vein because under there lies a nerve
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If he adds to this injury that the vein is injured and the nerve was hit so it falls into a stupor and its treatment becomes difficult and perhaps not curable.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 This nerve appears frequently to someone.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 Or if the nerve is hidden in some people and it is subtle and not visible; then you should put down your phlebotomy with that phlebotomy when they are cut off with the sickle and lifted up with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 When one nerve is between two nerves, then it will find a name along its length
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 The tenth book on surgery
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The artery of the front part is connected to one that descends from the head.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 If you want to do so, if you press the artery with a phlebotomist and the one descending from the head or with a myrtle phlebotomist: because it is more salutary than all others, since it is not a vein nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However it was necessary for you at a phlebotomist so that you could press only the head's artery gently and find its place more easily: and if not, then you must strike it with force once, and then proceed to hit it multiple times with a phlebotomist or myrtle.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 But for some people, when they do not strike it with force initially but not cause harm to it anyhow.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 The utility of phlebotomy and the caution in its observance.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 Quality of phlebotomy and its accidents due to it, with which you should reflect on its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all it is necessary to know that phlebotomy should not be done unless for the sake of health and with care so as to prevent damage from occurring.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 So that you may phlebotomize one vein out of three veins such as the front part and side and back part.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 So that you may phlebotomize at first upon fasting and upon drinking water, then after eating as well, when the signs of repletion become visible.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 So that you may phlebotomize on the first day or third day when three hours have passed since the previous phlebotomy.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 The phlebotomy that is done on veins does not have a determined time interval but when it is convenient and necessary to do so, in the night or day, and at all hours, and during all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 Do not let children be phlebotomized before they have reached 14 years of age
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A woman should not be phlebotomized unless she has been pregnant for at least four weeks up to seven months
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Do not let the elderly who have passed 60 years of age undergo phlebotomy
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Only if someone is experiencing a severe deficiency should they undergo phlebotomy to get rid of excess blood, and in case this occurs within the bowels (intestines), it will prevent putrid substances from escaping through the main veins into the body's organs, so that they do not come into contact with them.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Do not let a patient be phlebotomized until they are full of hunger and have ceased vomiting; neither should he drink water excessively until the condition is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Do not let one who is ill with fever undergo phlebotomy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Do not let phlebotomy be repeated after passion/love, and a person's death, and excessive drinking of wine, and multiplication by intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and fasting, and the abuse of food and drink, and all that has been dissolved out of their power from the body whether human or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Next consider in subtlety the qualities and humors before that; if the blood is thick with your food and drink or medicines; if it may be possible for him to have phlebotomy done.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter the bath (water), unless something is forbidden or some exercise must be applied so that blood may become thin again.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And let phlebotomy be applied to his heart three days later as we said, and he will purge the pectus from all accidents of animals in that day; so that distress, rage, fear will come away: and from all accidents of bodies, so that labor, punishment, excess, and like things shall come away.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let his servant do what is customarily done by men from things which are used with the use of aromatics and odors and with the noise and similar things according to amount possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 In such a position must be the phlebotomist higher than that of the vessel to be phlebotomized; then he extracts his own arm and flexes it with both hands alternately, or in any other way
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 After tightening the ligature, he releases it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 If the ligature is not of equal tightness, either it will be removed due to excess or because of its inequality; otherwise it may prevent blood flow either by relaxation (mollification) or because of its tension (stricture).
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 After ligature removal, the phlebotomist must simultaneously flex his hand to the vessel and apply a tourniquet; then he releases it and announces its pressure on the patient's wrist.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 After releasing the ligature with little oil or in any other way, the phlebotomist is done.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 After placing his index finger on the hand of the patient in the place where phlebotomy is to be performed (on the wrist), he applies a tourniquet lightly so as not to cause any pain and may not strike percussion; he does this gently
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because the tourniquet is tight when tightened against the patient's hand as with a stretched chord (a tourniquet too tight), it remains full of tension; and when it is placed over her/his arm, it tightens further under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist must tighten his arm to release it. If released by the phlebotomist, she/he is restricted: therefore if loosened, let him relax all his muscles.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 After removing tourniquet
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If one of the vessels is released from tension because it has been fully relaxed (the patient is not unconscious or dead), then it's good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if the other vessel remains tense nearby (or above) because of its position or friction with the ligature; then it must be loosened more in that place
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If released (or loosens) the ligature to release him from death or disability then he releases that vessel on one day; for two days if the first vessel is also released (and not tightened).
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Fortasse indeed receives hot blood
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 It does not receive cold water.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then it will receive a drawing of the veins if it wants to.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small and only allows blood to flow gently, or if the veins are thin; then a further drawing of the veins into this place according to proper procedure will be made as an addition during the surgery itself.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And perform this with a finger first before sealing off the opening, for the seal is not secure on many people after surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you want to seal this up already, then do not repeat it all over again; for otherwise there is nothing else that can be done on you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something above it from olive oil so that the blood course may continue to flow.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better here than oil alone and with any other oil left over.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer olive oil to your veins throughout all your operations wherever the flow of blood is prohibited; and they will do this with their fingers as an addition when it is placed above that place
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 The blood becomes thin and resolved after being thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If a drawing of the veins is made large into that opening where blood has been lost, for many times this occurs especially to those who are not phlebotomized unless they had a very small opening; or if it is an extremely small opening then immediately place and bind a sponge soaked in water and salt around it: and you will do so after the hour when done.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it should be so that you make this afterward by yourself with your own complement or from another person.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If there is something left over in that place after the days have passed or a night has come, it does not harm to do this; and if you are able, then place above it something like olive oil or Myrrh from those who sell them: or put something made of honey water which is either scented with scents similar to theirs.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 "Many a time it happens that a vein is cut off and a notable person dies at the Phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 "As for your hand upon this spot, if you fail to apply gentle pressure over it during the compression on top of it, that is when she becomes the bad omen.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 "Therefore, as soon as you place something from what we have said upon her.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 "For the blood may flow out of this vein
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 "But you must keep your grip on it while there is a stiffness.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of him with the remaining treatment, until he recovers.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 "And you must remove from every man as much blood according to his own strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 "And what shows through a reddish color on the veins.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 "If the blood is black, then you let it run out and until he becomes pale; similarly if you see a thick one in front of him, then you remove him until his color returns to its normal state; similarly if you see a thin one.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 "You must do this to him who is full and strong, so that the bloodletting may be done once over it, increasing one's strength of veins; and for him who is weak, the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 "And you must remove him from the hands and so make the opening narrow; better it is that treatment done for one bloodletting than to make a cut.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 "The way of bloodletting is safe with the flow of blood and from cutting; it's better than doing one for a long distance and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 "And to one who was cut off by bloodletting suddenly, you must apply a small amount of warm food soaked in water before the bloodletting and if it's heated, remove his blood from the hands four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 "And if his complexion is injured, he should apply before the bloodletting a food soaked with my syrup or with a mixture of spices.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 "If the vein is struck by a snare and death results from excessive blood loss, then it is necessary to insert water into the body through veins while applying a sweet-smelling syrup; furthermore, the application should be accompanied with aromatics such as those mentioned in this chapter on syncope.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 "Whoever strikes their own arm with a snare and blood loss occurs because of the removal [of blood], it is necessary for them whose phlebotomy has been weak due to excessive withdrawal; their strength must be restored so that they can bleed more slowly over time.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 "Whoever strikes their own arm with a snare and blood loss occurs because of the removal [of blood], it is necessary for them whose body has been strong; then they should make an appointment to have their phlebotomy done again after seven hours or within one day.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 "Whoever pulls blood from their own body to the opposite side so that it falls down; then they should have this done again within two or three days.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 "For those whose body is already heated and has become acut [i.e., feverish], and they have caused this to happen; it is necessary for you to extract the blood from them quickly, in one go, so that their opening can be reopened: as long as all conditions of phlebotomy are observed by you; and then put your hand over his chest while he is at rest, so that death does not occur due to syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 "Indeed, it happened many times when the phlebotomist was ignorant and negligent.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 "It is not necessary when you are removing the arm and bleeding blood for a second time while there is already an opening in one vein; it can become difficult to extract blood, so that he has to struggle with excessive strength.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 "This is a bad thing for the phlebotomist who did not do this properly; let him be released from it when another phlebotomist does it.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 "Or remove with the aid of phlebotomy that which has formed from blood within one vein's opening; and then place something salty dissolved in water on top.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 "Put something from a tyriac onto it or a sageneum and then press down on it with pressure to make blood flow out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 "The seal is ready now; please release (it) and do not hold on tightly, until it is released completely.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 "If a need arises to remove blood from the second location and it is not allowed due to some exception, then either use a phlebotomy on that same place or move your hand with another arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 "In such cases the arm used for phlebotomy would be the one of the veins (Fuscae) and the basilica (Basilica), since they are closed off due to being composed out of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 "The quality or effect of phlebotomy is as follows: the patient inserts his hand into a warm water until it feels cold and shows visible evidence.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 "Afterwards, tie on that with medium tightness of the bandage only.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 "After that, apply the phlebotomy from the same place gradually and not longitudinally or transversely; make a wide opening and let your phlebotomy be above the band with more than medium tightness.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 "If the exit of blood is prohibited, then repeat this action by placing your hand into warm water and releasing the flow of blood into water until you have fulfilled a necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 "If you are exhausted due to the weather or other factors, please release your hand from the warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 "Finally, after doing this for a long time into the warm water, it may be wise to put the course of blood back into cold water gradually.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 "The phlebotomy of this one is more beneficial to all veins compared to any other, since it is not weak in pressure and does not collapse.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 "Phlebotomy by the left hand of Salamella would be applied with the aim to treat internal hemorrhoids.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 "The quality of this phlebotomy is as follows: tie it with a bandage or your own hand after you insert it into warm water until it becomes cold and visible.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 After removing blood vessels from that area
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 If the whole vessel is completely removed, it will not die to some extent
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Hold on with your hand while removing the blood vessels.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 Do not cut off the fingers of the hand when removing flesh along with it.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Repeat this process for each subsequent finger and release its blood into that area
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 If you do not repeat the process with another artery heated to a warm temperature, then the blood will clot inside and be prohibited from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 After removing an adequate amount of blood with all necessary effort, then place it over a fire or frying pan to prevent coagulation.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly you should do this with every branch tightly closed.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The hand of the patient should be held with the left hand; this is because it is being connected to spleen pains and similarly you should do it for him as you did in the second case.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The hand of the patient should be held with the left hand; this is because it is connected to spleen pains and similarly you should do for him as you did in the second case, and retention of menstrual periods, weakness of kidneys, ulcers on the thighs, old wounds and sores on the buttocks, and similar ailments from the diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of the phlebotomy should be such that a weak patient puts his foot into warm water and makes it to strike above him with friction until he faints; then lift up the leg holding the correction with both hands.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The veins at the foot appear above the heel and will give rise to multiple veins in the face of the leg.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, remove it from a larger vein or under his heel if possible; this is better and more effective.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If removing it from the veins of the leg is not possible, then cut through them beneath his face to reach him.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Hold on with your hand as you remove the phlebotomy from above, just like when you aim to cut it; this is a phlebotomy of Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If blood loss is prohibited then follow this procedure for taking a blood vessel and withdrawing the blood from that vessel until he has lost enough
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist encounters an upper vein and does not find any obstruction in it, then he should proceed to the next one that is higher up
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 Similarly with both feet
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The sciatic vein is located at the back of the heel.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The tool for withdrawing blood from this vein should be applied to the ankle when it's due to a cold or frozen blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of the phlebotomist is important so that it can be used by an injured person and it will work well. It should hold the foot from ankle to above the calcaneum with four fingers using a long thin tool, otherwise nothing appears when needed.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When this appears then the phlebotomist should use it according to your best knowledge or by incision and removal of the tool if necessary, whichever is better for you.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 This vein is superior in many people but hidden from sight in others.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you cannot see the vein and it does not appear on all sides of your foot then the phlebotomist should choose someone else who can find the vein in the back of their foot for use and draw out an amount of blood that is necessary.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then apply a stricture over the location where you placed it on top of the vein to hold it in place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It will heal itself
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 The use and quality of this tool
Caput XCVIII.	 The end of the text
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Blood will flow from veins and arteries and veins
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Venous or arterial bleeding.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 Bleeding can be controlled with both incision and extraction of blood, or without cutting the vein but removing it.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 The operation that is performed without incision has two ways of doing it
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or else
Aut est absque igne.	 Or else, without fire
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the operations that are performed with incision and extraction of blood have 12 locations in the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 The first one is the operation of the nape of the neck after shaving it off; and Alkehel means the middle ear which is done with an instrument used to remove wax from ears, and Alhagdahim refers to the removal of a tooth in the lower jaw by using instruments on both sides at once.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 It also does not remove blood from you with tiny cuts into the flesh due to that reason your strength was lost as it is a case of phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to perform the operation with fire or without fire if any part of it will occur from using force due to that reason it must be applied throughout the body completely.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If the need arises for performing the operation due to force or custom we apply it at all times from the beginning of a month until its end and also through any other time period.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 It is because with humans there are those who when they multiply the blood within him it must be extracted from them through that operation and it injures to his head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among these there are those who have hurt the face, head, and neck due to excess wax build-up.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among these there are those who have had itching on their face, forehead, and darkness and greyness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them there are those whose spot for that operation is injured.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 Among these there are those who have had a lot of swelling occur.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them there are those who have had excessive taste for blood in their mouth; or the tongue is damaged and it loses the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 That which increases sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And that which causes blood and mucus to flow through one's sleep, cuts, bruises, and wounds, similar to what is mentioned earlier
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 Therefore when we wish to obtain something from them, the proper time is after two hours or three of wakefulness (i.e., during the third hour of wakefulness).
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The ointment for Venasation (a procedure to cure headaches) is this: because it is applied to the head and brings relief to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 And so it should be used after the complete evacuation of the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this is the ointment for the head vein (a procedure to cure headaches).
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 Do not use it if you have a cold or a dry complexion.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 It will cause great harm to him/her.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 Do not use it if the patient has a cold or dry skin on their head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 If someone is very diligent in using this ointment, they will be covered with a rash all over their body.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And so it is important to use this ointment carefully when performing Venasation (a procedure for curing headaches) in order not to injure the hand while applying more vigorously towards the bottom of the face out of fear of an allergic rash (urticaria).
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Venasation or Alkehel is the ointment for curing the veins in the head (a procedure to cure headaches), and the veins on the back of the hand; it also helps with constriction, the desire for cutting (the desire to cut something off) and the need for tools.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It is important that the ointment of Alkehel be applied more vigorously when placed lower down towards the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 The procedure to cure headaches (Venasation) can cause pain and accidents on the head, as well as paralysis of the limbs, perforation injuries at the roots of the teeth, and it is an ointment for curing veins on the back of the hand.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "It is necessary that you do not touch the hand with a cut when performing surgery, in order to avoid damaging the artery and causing blood flow to stop.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 "The blow to the mouth should be given by a hook instead of a knife; and also when giving any other injury or cut on the tongue, it is necessary to give another place for blood-sucking insects that are in the mouth.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 "The blow to the eye should be given by a hook instead of a knife; and also when causing any injury or cut on the eyelid.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 "The blow to the inside of three nostrils should be given by a hook instead of a knife; and also when causing any injury or cut in the ears.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 "It is necessary that you do not cause much damage to the cut; because the location has been stripped of flesh and there are veins and arteries underneath.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 "The blow that is given above the anus should be aimed at hemorrhoids and ulcers below; or it may be aimed at the skin around an anal tear.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 "It is necessary that you give a strong blow instead of the mild one; and it must be aimed at air because the location requires great force to remove the delicate blows; or the cut may have been large.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 "The blow to the head should be given by a hook instead of a knife; and also when causing any injury or cut on the ears.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 "However, they may cause great harm to the body, and make it fall down many times in different people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The blow given by a hook is close to the blow given by two hooks for cutting; as well as when giving any injury or cut on the ears.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the blow is such that you should strike first with a quick blow and use an intermediate blow to remove any remaining resistance; do not prolong the position or keep them there too long so as to make all hearts rush towards their location equally: do not repeat the blows, but strike quickly once or twice.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Therefore consider the body's arrangement
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 The tender and fleshy parts of a man must be offered to sacrifices frequently, but not too often; otherwise the place (of sacrifice) will not remain whole.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And make use of the Ventosator to intensify cutting and to deepen it somewhat; so that he will control the flow of blood with a gentle touch, making him easy to apply and remove from any location.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is too much blood, then sacrifices must be offered twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 At first the delicate art of bleeding is revealed to him; and secondarily he learns about extracting the purest blood from a great vein.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If only the foul-tasting blood is present, then sacrifices must be offered once more; so that it will finally end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And at last when we want to extract blood as quickly or even faster than usual, one sacrifice is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to perform many extractions of blood with sacrifices, then let the sacrifices be made more often.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we wish to measure the quantity of blood by sacrificing deeply; and then reach an equal end in sacrifice as well with the depth of cutting, it will be sufficient.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is to be done with those oils that must be applied near the position of the Ventosators, and what will they accomplish?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 For a man whose skin is thick and tough with many pores that are strict; it must be given oils in abundance to the Ventosators with gentle application, soft, quick removal so that they will soften the places of the sacrifice as if using oil for anointing or anointment (oil of the head), or for applying sweetness from the amydala or seeds of cucumber.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 If it is in a time of death; then use oil of Narcissus or Lily, or Camomile, or Sarbatim (a mixture used for anointment). And they are similar to those oils mentioned above.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is too much thick blood; then use oil of the Bitter Almonds or Balsamum or Alben (a mixture used for anointment). And they are similar to those oils mentioned above.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 "The veins should be opened with the aid of large forceps, for delicate flesh: when this is done, it must be forbidden to use oil; and it must be that they may pass through the veins after the application of heated or cold water, or warm wine, or cold cucumber water, or portulacae water. And similarly there.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 "Whoever whose blood is very wet may open the veins with vinegar or water of myrtle; and so there.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 "Whoever has excessive quantities in their veins may open them with old wine or water of myrtle, or with the decoction of aniseed, or with the flowers of chamomile; and to them similarly.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 "It is necessary that the opening of veins take place in a bath or by a bathing tub; and when it has been done after leaving the bath for one hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 "And it must not be that someone falls asleep after the veins are opened.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 "What is needed to regulate Venous and Phlebo-matus before opening?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 "After that it is necessary to consider first of all: if Venous or Phlebo-matus becomes choleric and pain arises in his veins; then he must be given a cold remedy as quicklime: and also with vinegar and lettuce, and secaiabin, and iuleb. And similarly there.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 "And put food in his veins; let him eat his fill of it; and give him cooked foods with vinegar; and similarly.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 "And whoever's complexion is cold it must drink syrups from acacia or almond; or else from the seeds of secaiabin; and he may drink fragrant wine that has been mixed with vinegar; and he should be given little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 "And put food in his veins; and let him eat fish; and you will be wise, namely by eating a small amount of bread; and the bread of doves is also good.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 "The doctor must know how to make a vein of the same diameter as his finger and also how to tie it securely in order that nourishment may be taken from it, both for veins (venae) and arteries (arteriae). Furthermore, the physician should ensure that there is enough space within some men in order to perform surgery on their thighs with a knife. In other words, they must make an incision before taking nourishment or blood, either at the beginning of the operation or after; so as to relieve pain and alleviate discomfort.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 "It is not recommended that he apply heat to it.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 "Without incising (cutting).
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 "Furthermore, those veins which are placed on the ear or any other part of the head, they do not need incision (cutting) because their skin is very thin and they can be tied directly.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 "It should not be sought through them unless there is a direct connection between the vein and the member of the body, such as tying the veins around the nipple during breast feeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 "We should tie them so that cold nourishment is poured into the member through it.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 "This would cause the body to relax and be freed of pain because it had been relieved from nourishment.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 "When a stone is found within them, they are placed over one kidney or the other (left or right).
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 "The attraction of his finger would open an incision and remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 "And similarly when they are placed on the ear or elsewhere, he ties them to drain nourishment into each of these two places.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 "These veins only receive water with very little cutting made in their surface.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 "And sometimes they are given with fire (scald).
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 "And sometimes they are given with full hot water into the ears to ease pain and swelling.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Formose venosi administrationis cum igni.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Insert the bone through its opening with two fingers of its thumb and forefinger, as we have shown; then place it so that one end is at the lower side near the middle of the windpipe, the other in the upper part by inserting it into the windpipe: and let it be held in the middle where air enters and leaves.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now we have made it large enough to be larger than what we had before; and only slightly smaller from the points of view of age and health: as is used in its position.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 Its use for children, however, differs from that of adults; it is smaller and thinner than the one used by men or those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of applying it when heated over the body is as follows: it can be set ablaze with a flame from linen; or by using a small candle placed in front of it so that one end is below and the other above, to ensure that only the inferior part of it burns without burning through the body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place it on the body; put your finger into its opening until you have hold of the formose, at that point take your finger out and let it fall back through the opening quickly so that there is no delay in breathing.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then light up its flame according to its own way; and again do this whenever necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 The formose used for washing with water is not to be held across the windpipe; it should not be administered unless filled with water and placed on the body as needed.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is how we have shown its use.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 Its size has increased more than before, so it can hold a great deal of water and is better for washing.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 On the suspension of bloodsugars
Caput XCIX.	 The tenth chapter on the suspension of sugars in the head.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 The veins of more than one member are not opened unless there is a possibility for the position of the vocal chords within them, because of their harmony and pleasantness, as in the tongue, gums, and similarly to those.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 The veins of a member exposed to skin are not opened unless there is a possibility for the position of the nose within them, as with the finger and nasal cavity, similarly to those.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 The quality of the veins for these is that they are easily extracted from the veins containing sweetness and not putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 They must be taken out during the day and night into sweet water until they are completely dried up, so that nothing remains within them.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 After this, the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy, as well as by bleeding.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 After this, the member must be cut off until it is completely free from all pus and blood.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards they are placed on top of that.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 Afterwards they are inserted and fall off and the possibility of sucking at this point is with the flow of air, then it's even more ultimate with vomiting if not, then go to the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 After that with much water, he strains and presses out (the veins).
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood after the removal of veins is prolonged and remains there, then he introduces a cold pan into water and places it on top, until the residual drops out.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the blood is multiplied, then he compresses it with vinegar or wine and similar things from the vessels until all the blood has been extracted.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Alternatively, they are placed on a cloth of medium thickness and are removed until the fabric adheres to the place because blood is being extracted.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 It should be when necessary there is repetition of phlebotomy, that it may change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If veins are prohibited by suspension, then the place with recent blood must be removed.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Alternatively they may remain until something comes out of the blood from that location.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 When they feel something from blood, immediately they remove it
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want to die (i.e., when it is time for death), the pulse is taken from above and something from a wound, or saltpeter, or pitch, is applied; they quickly fall down.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 The second part of the end
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Third book on surgery by Albucasis
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 A lecture on the restoration of broken bones, dislocations, and the correction of twists.
Caput I.	 The first book on head injuries
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is very useful for the study of Medicine and contains restoration of fractures as well as dealing with dislocations caused by accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Hear you children, because many physicians and surgeons learn from this chapter; and those who have never read any other book on the subject will not understand it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for that reason (that it contains useful information) this method is well known to the physicians and surgeons in our land
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 I too have never learned from it anything good and I am not adept at all of what is said in this chapter; but when I took a long time to read the books on that subject, and studied more than my knowledge was worth, then I acquired some knowledge about it from those books.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I used experiment and study during my youth.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And I have described to you everything that my knowledge contained in this chapter; and beyond what experimentation was more than sufficient for me, when I showed it to you after reading it out loud, and gave it away from my occupation of reading books, and shortened the time to read fine points, and explained how forms were used by instruments as much as there are here above mentioned; so that in this chapter I formed many figures from the forms which are used in that field, considering declination added.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In conclusion and collections of fractures of bones which is necessary before we begin the remembrance of broken members, and others, one by one.
Caput II.	 On the second head
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 In the second head, let us begin with an introduction to this chapter and its summaries, followed by the chapters whose intelligence is first in importance for our surgeon: namely those who are already proficient or will learn from it at your place
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 When someone experiences a fracture or dislocation or torsion or any other such ailment, the surgeon must first seek to extract blood from them through phlebotomy; and if necessary also administer a purge or emetic as appropriate: unless something is prohibited by weakness of will power, so that it may be one who has caused harm to another person in childhood or old age, or due to great heat or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Afterward he may be fed with cold water and drinks of ice and oil; and prohibited from drinking wine and fat meats and filling his stomach with anything that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 After you have become secure from the cold of another person and do not experience any leakage to your member; then the weak one will return first to his own regimen that he is accustomed to, in order to be cured
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When therefore the mouth is restored, then it should be fed with food and drink, in which there are impurities that come from cooked tripe and broth and head and feet; and wine and other such things as well: and heavy wine and similar ones.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this regimen comes the coagulation of the fracture or dislocation, which is better
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And you know that if the bones are broken when they are in young men or old age and decrepit; it is not possible to continue as we wish for them according to their nature always, because of the exhaustion of their members; so they will be consolidated and continued which from those are at rest lenity.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature has placed something of this sort over the mouth that is broken from all sides and filled with thickness to which it adheres and tightens itself until they are returned together; and they are tied together in the end of strength and firmness as was mentioned before unless there is not prohibited by its own actions: and because of this cause, we must place food for them according to their weakness that has been described.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 "Know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members; because a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the arm; similarly every member has its own kind of fracture except for the bones joined together in one part. And I am coming with an explanation of all kinds of fractures, set out in his chapter separately.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 "And there are also different species of fractures within each bone itself.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Because a curved fracture occurs without the stars falling out of it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes there is a fracture along the length of its bones; and there are fractures with hooks or spurs, namely stars and additions coming out as if from a hook, so that they can be written down by being scraped away while it is being drawn toward writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not coming out; and there is a fracture with a nail and disruption of the head; and there is a fracture through a hole.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And for every species, one own tool or means of restoration is needed according to what the recollection does not explain clearly enough, set out separately in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from the one through which a fracture of bones is known, there is its twisting and brilliance; and appearance to him, and sound when he is compressed by your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore there is no apparent twisting in the place; and there is not a sound when you touch it with your hands and agitation; nor does it cause great pain, then there was no fracture at all possible, either tortuousness or short cut through: therefore do not press on to him completely by hand and compression, but put some medical remedy over him from which the recollection did agree upon the place; thereafter a subtle restriction should be drawn.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 "You know that when it curves and is divided into two pieces, apart from the hooks falling out of it; however all its parts are released one by one: then you should be to start with your hand at the time of his correction before he strikes him a cold hook.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If a patient's fever reaches a critical point, then immediately remove him from any heat or warm substance and allow him to rest until the fever subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Gradually reduce his temperature through gentle application of ice packs and intelligence (?), making it equal with whatever means possible.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And you should know that the restoration of him and his balance is easier than breaking those bones.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then gently remove any heat or warm substances from him until he remembers your instructions.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If the bones are broken, then there is a necessity to extend this member through two parts if he has hands or feet; if the member is a leg and it's not available with his hands or both legs are not available, then you need to use both ropes or one rope with your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And you should place the member on a level spot with your natural shape as long as the parts of broken members are extended; then you will have to apply them in different ways depending on where they can be applied and based on how strong or weak that location is: keep it simple, use one bone from both hands if necessary.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And at that moment you should stretch and pull him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If something else is necessary to do there, correct it and make it equal through the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And use gentle stretching along with strong compression as many others do for their patients.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 And many people carry out the lowering of his temperature with your own heat treatment or through compression on a member; as we see that from their actions and methods.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then fasten him after the balance is reached, and decrease the motion of his member, and tighten it up, and keep him calm and relaxed; but do not let a sick man go on top of him.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And do this gently so that he does not move around in your hour of relaxation or when trying to sleep and doing your relaxation exercises; but make him rest quietly and remain relaxed until the last moment of his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 "And let it be in such a position as follows: pain is not to follow.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 What this means is that when the pain occurs from a certain position of members, or injury, then it should be changed to another position which does not feel the pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And let him have his position back with equal force, straight; so that he does not run into the twisting of limbs when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of a member broken in many ways has been described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Indeed, the limbs broken at different times and their magnitude and form are different.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Therefore, from those it is similar to a limb and finger and the like, then there should be the connection of soft clothes or thin material.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 However, from those it is similar to a thigh and leg, then there should be the connection large, strong.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because of a long ligament connecting a big member and tightening it from all sides to an equal extent so that it does not tear the member.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Afterwards place the liniment on your evacuation from equal parts so that it is above the location of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Afterwards you start to pull the ligament above the location of the fracture with three or four pulls depending on what is needed for the member; and tighten your hand more strongly than before by using the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Afterwards you go to the top of the location from where the fracture occurred and tighten less than before because the place of the broken limb is still tense after the pull.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Afterwards you go to the top of the location from where the fracture occurred even stronger and soften the tight rope gradually until the big thing outside the place is free again.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Afterwards you take another rope with more strength and start pulling it over the location of the fracture once more.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Afterwards, go to the lower portion from where the fracture occurred.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 Translation of this Latin text is "Your operation should be performed on a incision above the first one and with alleviation.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Next, place the incision between the two incisions (if possible) or with some soft material to equalize the fracture's tortuosity if it is present; otherwise do not place anything inside of it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then make another incision above this one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 After making both incisions equal in length and breadth immediately proceed to the second step if there is no inflation at the location otherwise do not apply any heat.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is inflation at that location or an abscess then place something above it to alleviate the inflation; and after applying heat remove the object within a few days
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then make another incision above this one.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And the incision above should be longer than both of the previous incisions and shall have a similar shape as well.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However it is necessary that the incision above placed over this incision should be larger and broader than both of the previous incisions; also its length should correspond to its size as determined by the member's dimensions and proportion.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then make another incision above both of them according to the first one.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 And make sure that your incision above is over the fracture location more; and as much as the fracture length becomes elongated its incision shall become longer while the smaller incision will become shorter
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it should be that there are three incisions: a short one, an intermediate one and a long one; all of them made with soft material.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the incisions are large as can be seen in operations of the hard ones placed with cord and straight lines there is a great mistake because the incision goes beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 The incisions should not come together again since you will not be able to reach through the incision with what you have.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not permitted for a finger to be between two stars that are closer together than it is with another star.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If a finger is injured by the sides of two stars that are closer together than permitted by law (i.e., when two stars appear to be closer together because of the angle at which they are viewed), then it must have been caused either from grasping them with too much force, or from touching something sharp and woolly; otherwise nothing will happen as a result.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a break caused by violence and the disruption of its hold, I will immediately repair it according to his special requirements (i.e., fashioning a splint for him).
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 It is understood that no broken part must be held together with a star on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 For when a part is very large, it should not be held together with the stars above itself unless at least five days have passed, or seven, or more (i.e., as many days as necessary to cool off the fire of your enthusiasm), according to my security guidelines.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is how splints are made and used by those who restore fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 The common mode of using splints is to bind them in several layers with bandages and especially for women (because it does not cause overheating) or children, so that they do not cause either heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 It is also done by binding them with the bristles of a broom and attaching a small feather to each corner so that they can be easily moved around; and bind them as tightly as necessary (except for holding their ends together securely), avoiding excessive tightness or looseness in both cases, lest the splint itself should not be too loose nor too tight.
Deinde utere eo.	 In conclusion
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another way of using splints is to restore fractures and dislocations as well as twists (torsions).
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Use aloe, and laurel, and ivy, and mugwort; and as well incense of myrrh (myron), aloes of both kinds (V), and aloes of two different kinds or varieties (XX); they should all be mixed with water to cool them off if overheating occurs when being held together, either with bandages or with the bristles of a broom.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 "Then use this bandage.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 It is beneficial for good compositions and restores broken bones or wounds; it soothes many people (plural).
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another bandage that also helps fractures and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare the mixture of honey and water; they are beneficial for various ailments such as itching (V), burns (VI); they soothe and calm many people with their cool refreshing touch. They also help to treat wounds or sores and administer them separately when indicated.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Method for using the bandage to treat fractures in addition to bone injuries; it also soothes the pain of accidents on the bones and cuts.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 The wool is soaked in vinegar and olive oil mixture then applied to the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this method of using the bandage there is no restoration of strength; however it is beneficial for soothing and cooling pains to eliminate them (the pain) directly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method for healing broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Cut the wool from sheep and goat; mix it thoroughly to make a bandage of good quality for everyone.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method for making a quick bandage suitable for fixing fractures in bones; it should be applied when there is still some pain remaining from the accident.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare a mixture of elderflower, chamomile, and laurel berries; it is beneficial for all to relieve various ailments (plural); they soothe people with its warmth when there is no heated membrane.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If a heated membrane is present then apply it with a mixture of damp vinegar and water or just with water; use that (the heated membrane) separately.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for healing fractures is when the injury to the member is severe and painful; it is more effective than the previous one.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Prepare a mixture of elderflower, linseed, balm of Gilead, mallow, sumac, and laurel berries; it is beneficial for all to relieve various ailments (plural); they soothe people with salty or sweet water depending on the severity of the ailment.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 All of this according to its temperature and a calm heat
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates did not say this in his book, that a fractured bone should be set back together with fire only from the wood and oil; instead he said it must also include calculation of both size and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galeno agrees that when a fractured bone is set back together for restoration of its owner, there should be included the cooling effect of myrrh and aloes as well as other similar substances we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 A method to relieve pain and injury.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Recipe with rue and cicer (a type of celery), as well as the hair of man's incisors or eyelashes, along with salt; they would be crushed, boiled together, and then a plaster made from this mixture applied to the wound.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity should be according to how long the bandage will last; then it is soaked in something warm (like wine), after which it must be applied to relieve pain and itching, but not allow saliva or blood from the mouth to come out of its own place; thus it could not have been used repeatedly on many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If the itching or pain worsens, then quickly apply it immediately after washing off the old one; and take a fresh one when needed, soaked in hot water to soothe the itchiness as well as relieve the pain.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 After that allow the member to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 After that apply a mixture of lanolin and oil (or olive oil) to it at night; cover it with a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil or sweet oil, until the swelling has calmed down completely and the pain is relieved from its companion with cold application, and it shall remain quiet and still.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 After that repeat the process of application with a plaster made from soft material (like cotton wool); and do not bind it with your tight constriction first thing in the morning or at night; instead gently apply it by its own subtlety to make it whole again, until it is completely healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 "If you see the arrowhead, the swelling, and pain, and bruising, and all injuries are remote from that point onwards, tighten the stitches as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 "If nothing happens to any member from the ones we mentioned, then bind it not until after three days or four days or five days or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 "And when that is done for a hundred days, until you see the dissolution of the member from the solution as we mentioned, so bind it, unless there is a fracture and the approximation of the flesh over it: add to this in stricture more than your first tightness altogether; and also add in the swelling of food, according to what preceded his remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 "If you see the place of fracture is already opened up and extended more than it should be: then you know that food must not be allowed to come near it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 "Therefore bind him with warm water around all the wounds wherever you find them, and let it remain thus for three days, and alleluia increase the tightness.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 "Because of this operation food must be given to the member, or sooner recovered.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 "This is what the restorers of a fractured member do by way of another method when they are unable to restore it immediately as we mentioned above. It is an error from their operation and great fear: if there was any rectitude in their book, they say this has been done by them with him.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 "And I did not see from any of theirs the evidence in that all at once as we mentioned earlier.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 "On fractures to the head.
Caput III.	 "The third injury to the skull.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 "There are several types of fractures and their shapes vary greatly; and the causes of them are different.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 "From the fracture occurs when it is struck by something coming to or from which causes a total collapse downwards into bone, such as an axe into wood; and for this reason that type of fracture is called the Axial Fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 A blow falls upon certain bones, and strikes his face, but the blow does not penetrate to his very end; it is called this species of fracture, i.e., the absolute rupture
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 It can be a small or large one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from the fracture is what is called recoil, or withdrawal; and cause of it is striking with a stone, or case over the stone, or similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 It can also be a penetrating one, which is already approaching the bone; or it may strike upon the face of the bones; and from fractures there are two kinds, large and small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And hidden within a bone by the subtlety of a hair is what is called fracture; and it may be small because that is why they call this species of fracture, i.e., the capillary one.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among them is a fracture which may strike with the case or a blow on the stone; and from this they do bring forth threads of bone into the inner part; it may happen suddenly as when a stroke of fire occurs to people and the part thereof is brought into the inner part.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Most often this happens on the hands of bones or head; like children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 These are to be distinguished into species of fracture with a separation of the game; and I am alone on this spot with the remembrance of all things connected with him.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We all know the species of fracture by inspection upon them and the examination of their threads; and the removal of the corrupted things above mentioned.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The species called capillary is known by this; it is detected above the eye and removed with a scraper and cleaned above itself with wax; for thus does the black fracture appear.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the accidents; then if you know what is meant by an evident sign above terror, just like cholerae and extension, misplacement of intellect, breaking off speech and syncope, fever and withdrawal from eyes, and similar things in many positions for curing far away. If however there are no accidents to be considered that may threaten your life, then begin with the treatment thereof.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 "When a wound is closed and healed first of all; and that is done on the seventh day after closing.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 "And if it is on the days of decay [i.e., after a meal], then you should remove the food before seventh day.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 "If a fracture of the bones has already reached the skull and brain, then it is with caution; and after some time, after an accident.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 "And it is that you should raise the wounded head; and cut above the wound according to what method suits you best; and according to the shape of the wound, and what lies above weakness.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 "If you fall by the flow of blood from a bone or an arrow heated up; then raise him with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 "And it is that you should place the wounded with wet cloths into wine and oil; and make them to rest until they are no longer heated by an arrow or the flow of blood, and remain safe from flowing blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 "Then begin in the care of the bones, and on the healing of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 "It happens according to one or another way.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 "One way is that you cut the wound with a straight and sharp knife; and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 "Another way is to administer the knife after the incision, further away than that; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 "Then you also administer another knife farther still, according to custom.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 "The second way is that there be a certain number of different knives; some are larger than others, and some are smaller; and those near the end of the bone are sharp on one side but blunt on another; and you use them easily in hitting upon the knife so as not to cut off its head, and to let it bleed.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the eye is strong, then it should be treated by a doctor of eye surgery before administering anything related to Incisoria or Terebra which are not deep (i.e., surgical instruments). And they are not called like that unless their own ends penetrate through the flesh into this place, which is below his head: for that reason, the Terebro is a rounded extremity above this, which is underneath his head sharply and similarly limited to a small circle by the edges around it, so as not to submerge or slip downward.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is advisable for you that you collect from these many Terebra a great number of them one by one and come to terms with the quantity of surgical instruments necessary at this time: whose sharp extremity in length and brevity should be equal, according to the measure of their cranial size.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And these are three types of trephining tools, or trepaning instruments.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of penetrating through the eye sockets is as follows: so that you place a trepaning tool over your eye and repeatedly insert it with your fingers until you know for certain that it has penetrated into the eye.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then exchange the trepaning tool to another place and put whatever fits through all openings with a large diameter around it (?).
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then strike with Incisoria what is through all openings from bone and do it as delicately as you can above that by the limit of thickness, just like we said until you remove your eye or with a hand or something else taken from those instruments used to this: so that there are handles (?), and small edges delicate.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 It is advisable to be cautious so as not to hit the trepaning tool or Incisoria anything from the siphon (?).
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 After you have penetrated the eye and separated from it by the siphon (?), if there was continuity with that, then you take away what remains of him, so that the handles remain on his part which is remaining in bone along with a similar Incisoria instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 "However, it is necessary that the incisions be slender and delicate in other places.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If any part of bone remains after removing it from the bones, then take that with ease and as close to you as possible using the tools at hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then take care of the wounds in the area next to them, along with the ointments we mentioned earlier.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of surgery is easy but long and filled with fear: this was said by Galen and praised it highly: and that is the speech he mentioned earlier.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is not necessary for you at first to remove the part of bone from its place where it has been broken more severely and visibly: until when removing that part and positioning yourself under its extremity this slender and delicate incision will be complete.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the part of the incision is slender and does not cut anything; but it reaches to both sides of him like this so that it ends at his side as a sharp point facing bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike above the incision from one side with a blunt object gently; until you have struck through it completely and easily as mentioned earlier so that you are secure on its sheath where it does not hit when striking at it again later.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 If the medician were not sterner than most men and more ignorant of it, nor sleeping, then if any part of bone had remained after removing it from its sheath in certain places, he would strike at that with his extremity this slender and delicate incision as mentioned earlier and would release him off by ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 He is released without a burden and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the fracture of bone does not penetrate to the sheath and that part which is removed from bone has its face toward him and remains in him with a roughness and delicacy: then it is necessary for you that you take care to remove this roughness and those details gently using the tools at hand, so that they are available as close to you everywhere among them according to their number and amount.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 "You should wash your mouth thoroughly before you remove food from it.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 "After washing your mouth thoroughly...
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 "...until you remove it gently with care and wash it thoroughly.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 "...until you have carefully removed any remaining hairs and broken it gently to administer the remedy for its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 "...and there is that which you cannot conceal, with regard to any study or skill of this art, and it was set over the thing we have written about, and were shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 "...if the foreskin is detected and you remove it while cleaning your mouth: then you should take some linen to wipe it gently with, according to the quantity of tears, and immerse it in rose oil and place it over the tear duct.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 "...After that, take another linen or three and immerse it in wine and rose oil; then place it over the first one... And make this easier than you can do on it so as not to tear.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 "...Then administer it over the broad ligament; and do not stretch it except to what extent the tear is stretched by you... And let this be removed with due care in one or two days, unless six men are secure from the cold.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 "...Then you should administer post this remedy with those in which there is too much dryness as are the roots of watercress and the wheat flour... And it is that you might make a purer juice from these remedies, as it was made on the tear so as to be similar...
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 "...And universally apply all medicines of which he is owner so that they might remove it not harm.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 "...According to your strength, may the tear be clear while you are caring for it; neither should there be any sour odors of ointment or grease.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 "...Do not remove the foreskin from its place at all times; because when it is placed over the brain tear, it corrupts and putrifies him... And there was great harm to his head after that bad luck: and already great harm happened on the head with the loss of care for him, darkening appeared on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore consider that if there happen accidents affecting the patient who has heard our sayings, know that it is fatal to delay in attending them
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if death does not come by accident unless there is a medicine placed on him and it has the power of that medicine to prevent death: then you should quickly take hold with both hands one part from the garment of oil and three parts from the linen cloth, and bind them together with these strips.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then put him on a stretcher; afterwards attend to him with the specified treatments until he is cured.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 When restoration fails.
Caput IIII.	 The second head
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Therefore know that the nose breaks only in two parts at once or one of them; moreover, because it is made up of two bones: its lower part is cartilaginous and does not break unless torn off with violence, roughness, and sharpness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one breaks off two parts of his nose then you should immediately insert your middle finger into the nostril of him who has broken and hold it with both hands while breaking that part with your index finger; press down on its edge until the nose returns to its natural shape: and make this so skillfully, quickly.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And also do not let his pain increase through that operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and you are unable to get your finger into it then you should stretch out your hand with both hands until you have extended its length so that there is no longer any room for error.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in both parts then do this to him; and if restoration is possible on the first day of the fracture take care of it as follows.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not on the seventh or tenth after quiet hours you should come with both hands warm and gentle.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert one strip of linen into the nostril if there is a fracture in only one part; or put two strips of linen into it if there are fractures in both parts and make sure that its width is so great as to fill up the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 Some restorers of ancient writings said that butter should be abundant and changed daily
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 This seems to escape me; it seems necessary for the supply of license to be abundant with white flour and beaten until a pulp is made from it
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let out the license, when he has eaten enough, and his mouth may stop and cartilage become firm
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes when the goose feather pen is inserted into the nosehole of a person who has already eaten enough bread, and it touches that same piece of bread with gentle touch: and it becomes as if it holds tightly to the crack in the bread, so that it does not allow itself to be pushed away by inspiration.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 This is not a necessary part.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, make this happen; and if you wish, make the license (i.e., permission).
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If Naso has already been warmed up by a hot towel and then applies the cold water, or if he sprinkles olive oil with garlic and coriander seeds, or if he gently blows on the water of the dish, let it happen.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 If Naso doesn't get warmed up by the hot towel, then it is necessary that he cover him with white flour and beat until a pulp is made from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then let down on top of him gently, but not allow any other person to touch him.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If Naso's bones are broken and they fall apart or come off easily, then it is necessary that the knife should be used to cut them out of him, along with the implements that go against his will.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then take the knife and care for him so that he is washed with those things which are moist or anointed with ointment as appropriate to this end.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If Nasu's mouth is broken and it has been healed by a certain ointment, then you must care for him with the liquorice so that he may drink from the leaden goblet until he becomes well.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 On restoration of the lower jaw bone
Caput V.	 The end of this text is "The end.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the Mandible (lower jaw) is broken and the fracture does not involve the teeth; at that point it is a simple fracture of its root alone, but if it breaks into two parts, then there are complications
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore if the fracture is on the right side of the Mandible (lower jaw), you insert your left index finger into his mouth: similarly if it's on the left side then you put your right index finger in; and with both hands hold back the force of the fracture towards the exterior, gently supporting from within while using the other hand to support from the inner part, equally.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the Mandible is already separated into two parts at this point you should administer an external rotation with both hands while maintaining proper alignment; until such time as it becomes possible to restore balance by its own accord.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If there has been a movement or disruption of the teeth; then you should bind them using thread from your mouth, cotton, or silk to prevent any further damage as they may move about.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Afterwards apply a poultice made with powdered plaster over the broken Mandible (lower jaw).
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Afterwards apply a poultice made with double cloth and a large starched bandage; either of equal size to the sole of your foot along the length of the Mandible (lower jaw).
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Afterwards you bind it over the top as prescribed by your teacher; and apply this bandage firmly until there is no longer any damage to be done. And after that gently feed him his meals using a spoon.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you think something has changed during the third day; then you should reapply it again that very same way.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Afterwards you correct what was altered from it and apply the poultice again after removing the powdered plaster; either with alum powder or flour mixed with water until you stop using the cloth. And afterwards you place over this bandage a thin linen sheet.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 As long as the poultice is applied over it and doesn't change its position; you loosen it up so that there are no longer any complications. You either bind the fracture or else let it be.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 "Therefore, this fracture is divided into three parts.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 "If a cold finger should suddenly come near [the patient], then administer to him immediately that which we had already mentioned for the purpose of bringing him out from under the spell.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 "And if there is another injury along with it, consider that one as well.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 "After the bone has been separated from its flesh and there is no other injury, then consider carefully what was said regarding this matter [the removal of the splinter], so that you may deliver to her [i.e., a woman] with whom it came into contact in the process of removing these splinters.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 "But if there is a narrow wound from which blood flows slowly, then expand it with the second syringe according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 "When you have taken out the splinter and it has not released anything from them, then take care of the narrow wound if it is large: otherwise, put something over [the wound] from those instruments which are used for that purpose until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 "Regarding the restoration of a splinter when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 "Chapter six.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 "Many a splinter is broken off from the front part of the arm and its fracture proceeds according to one out of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 "Or it may be broken off and separated into two parts besides what might happen at the same time [i.e., injury], which is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 "Or as a result of an injury from bone or splinter, and that makes it more difficult to restore [it].
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 "Or if there is another injury with the fracture.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 "And when the fracture is without an injury, it will be necessary to have two assistants present who hold each other by the arms so that one of them may follow up on the fractured bone and another may lift back his hand.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 "Then make an equal [fracture] with your fingers until it becomes the shape which is necessary to fit into place, and there should not be much elevation or little.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 As soon as the swelling has increased more than before, it is necessary to apply a compress with a wet cloth or wool, and its size should depend on your need; then stretch out and draw up the furculum from beneath the swelling using one hand only, until the arm breaks [i.e., the swelling subsides].
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you are unable to pull the arm of the furculum outside, then it is because it has gone deep; so that the patient should be raised on his bed: and place him with the palm of your hand in such a way as to support him on one side, until he can draw up the furculum which is inside his mouth towards the top. And afterwards you correct the fracture using your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel any pain when pulling out the furculum or it moves, then at that moment you should find him upright and take hold of his head from underneath in an easy way
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If the patient is retained by the bone and you cannot find him upright when pulling it out with one pair of scissors that you have prepared for this purpose; after you place beneath the furculum the instrument made from wood or iron which should then support his head: it's an instrument made from wood, or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 The hearing organ of the one who lacks harmony should be filled in.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 Its size depends on how much it swells from the extent to which your body increases and the force with which you push against it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 Its length is also determined by what is possible for you in performing an operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It has two extremities like a human hand; the one extremity is broad and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If a disruption occurs when pulling out the furculum by your force, its size is broad and you will secure it with sutures using both lips; at that time gather the two edges of the lips together to make a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 If there is only a minor disruption or if it was not possible to use the sutures of the lips; then gather its edges using strips of linen and sew them together as you would for a small tear.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If you drop a heated stone into cold oil, then pour it out of the hot oil and vinegar and wine are added on top
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 A stricture in the throat when it is absent from nourishment and without a physician's attention may cause the food to pass through the nose instead of entering the mouth.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And put on top a small amount
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 After that you gently blow into it if it is ready.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 After that you gently blow into it if it is ready.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 And put on top a small amount of powder and the food item.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 After that you gently blow into it if it is ready.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 And place on top of the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 After placing it with a cloth, put the star next to where it fell and the spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 After placing it with a cloth and putting the star next to where it fell and the spot, place on top of its head and under a healthy breath and under an ill one: then move down from its whole part so that you know how the stricture holds onto the fracture tightly; and is this? That which was not hidden over you, but all in order as nothing can be removed above it.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this purpose should aspire to breathe poorly every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the ligament becomes soft and you can remove the star, then adjust that thing and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 After that you put the sick person on their back and place under a breath near to their mouth from the night air so they can be helped by the side of them.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, the fracture is removed through the removal of the shoulder blade.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or tie it to the side with a ligature of the arm, and do not use it if it is not fixed immediately or by an accident from itching, or from a fall, until the 12th day.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 "Then stretch the bandage until you can see its face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 Add a stricture and release it, so that it may be restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And a fracture of the penis is stretched, and tightened according to the maximum in twenty days; and sometimes it happens with certain men for less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Of restoration of fractures.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Rare the spatula is broken; and at its place it is broken only on one side of it; but not the other parts.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When therefore it is broken from that place, and the middle of it; but not known by touch alone this; then according to which figure was fractured separation prepare for it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce its size to a natural form in all ways that you can do.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then put on the surface of it gently with water and oil, and a bandage, and put two pieces of linen over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then put on top of it an arched star from the fine table in proportion to the spatula's whole size; or its upper end can be a bit more.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If the concavity of the spatula is too great for some place; then level out its concavity with gentle pressure until it descends in proportion to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then fasten down from above with long and fine linen, with gentle constriction, and firmness of the star; until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider it every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the ligature is softened, tighten it; and if it has to be moved from its place, then hold fast on the smooth side of your body.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And the spatula may be restored within twenty days; or one day and a half.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When that number is completed then loosen up the ligature; and you are at peace.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 The tongue is removed from the bones with which it has become accustomed, and there's no solution for them
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If it arises out of a bone, though it fails to pierce beneath the lips; remove it above from the mouth and swallow it down.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said in case of a fractured tooth: if anything strikes on that, wash with warm water and vinegar.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Of the restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	 The eighth head.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Sometimes it breaks in its middle and rarely occurs on that part.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Extremities of him break off most frequently, and they fall apart from his accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle of him breaks down and leans towards inferior, with pain it strikes, difficulties in breathing, and thus; perhaps he bleeds, and a concavity is declared on the bone that has broken, and is not concealed from sense: Restoration is to be made as he lies upon his back, so he places between the tongs something like pulp.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then stretch his upper arms and join the two sides with both hands and feet; balance on all sides until this figure is restored as it was intended to be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then he places above him a bandage and a small shield of wood or metal; on top also an astrolabe from the table, with its points arranged to show the signs of the zodiac; so that one can see her in the cloth after she has been woven into it.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then bind her around the mouth so she cannot fall out; and tie it down with a cord at its neck according to the roundness of its girth, and tie it firmly enough.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the binding at all times and whenever it relaxes, tie her down; if necessity arises to solve his problem in the place where he is, or corrosion may have occurred, or pain, or apostema: then attend to that quickly, and undo what has been done with the way of your care for him.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 "Then make an incision in it if you wish; after that, insert a needle and sew.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 After the costae have been torn apart.
Caput IX.	 The ninth head.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 It does not strike the costae unless it occurs at locations which follow the back; and from the extremities of those parts it separates them from their front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not break them off except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of those is not concealed from you by interrogation using fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 Its restoration is such that if the crack has been made in an appropriate way with your fingers as permitted by nature and when restored, the figure should be as it ought to be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then make a snare for its broken nose if you wish; after that stitch up with the star as shown below.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the costae are torn apart from within; then it strikes a weak man with pain in his belly and punctures him where he has many veins, so that his nose is pierced with difficulty by this, and there as well as to the eye: therefore, because of the nose, or rather its piercing, it also strikes difficulties, and they, and blood wounds multiply; and these are difficult treatments.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And already clever men have been put in there with many engines; and from them are those who say, that you should place food for the sick ones which generate inflammation and heaviness so that the belly is inflamed, and it extends and is pulled towards the outside by the fracture.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We are averse to this lest it not become cause for an extremely cold contraction if it does not strike.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If then it strikes, you must then put something into it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: Place on the place a gentle thing and afterwards gently with force; and thus is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However it should be feared that too many gentle things could overflow the place due to the weakness of those who have been affected.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 "Some of them said that the place should be opened to the wool soaked in warm oil and then placed between the ribs; until it swells up so as to provide an equal knot.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Afterwards, the sick person was cured through food and medicine
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the patient is exhausted and cannot tolerate it, he spits out or suffers a wound from the biting of the doctor; then we fear for the patient; so let us open up a vein above this place to draw off some blood
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Afterwards we place the tool that extracts the vein over it; its name has preceded this; and we make an incision with a knife to get at it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Afterwards we gather two nostrils if there is one large as well; and we cure him with splints until he gets better.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If the patient's temperature rises at this point and then falls; we immediately apply a warm oil, and place it above that location to cure him with what accords best with his condition.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In the meantime, another incision is made over the side where he has been lying until he gets better.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 The restoration of the fractured ribs and collar bones
Caput X.	 Skull of X
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 The ribs and collar bones are also affected by fractures less frequently but equally as well; just like the occiput of X.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 Because it happened to this one, and you know that he is cured or not; then take note of
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 If you know that his hands are already soft and stiffened and dead; so he cannot move them or stretch them out, nor constrict them with your fingers, when you try to strike him with a blow from your hand, it doesn't make sense for this one and there is no pain felt in these parts either.  Then know that he will not be cured and death lies ahead in many cases.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he is able to move them and feels the constriction when you strike with your fingers or a blow; then know that there was a previous stroke in these parts and that this one will get better through food and medicine.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 When the thumbbones of the left hand are broken similarly and you know how to treat them or not, then consider its position in relation to your feet; if when they become loose you know that it has happened as well, but when this occurs in the hands - then at that point you understand that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Do not exert yourself unnecessarily while caring for him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If the above did not cause any damage to him, then it is better (or: less harmful).
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the care he received for what happened to him is that you administer a soothing ointment with sweet oil and warm sun; or if you want to, give food (nourishment).
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place this on the spot every now and then during the day until it is soaked with soothing ointment from the cold; if you want to stretch it a bit between the fingers, warm it up gently, hold onto it with a cord and make sure that there's no loosening of the skin or any injury.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Do not let him rest on his part where he received the pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If something has happened to the left thumbbone and it is separated from him - then you must take off his clothing and get that thing out of there.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then close both lips together with a stitch if they are large enough (large enough to cover the thumb).
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with some warm oil until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of his left hand is broken and there's no other way out - then you should put your thumb into his mouth with your right hand as well; if that doesn't work for some reason or another, try to break his second tooth from the inside (the one on the opposite side).
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then put it back onto him and get that thing off; and care for his wound along with what came before while he is being healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Of Restoring Ankh
Caput XI.	 Of Removing The Skull
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rare bones are broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If the bones are broken, then the fracture is not complete unless there is a comminution to the extremities of them; and they divide into lengthways, and fall towards their interiors; and there happens a weakness in pain at its place, and perforation: and it makes the hand tremble when it is broken.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 The restoration of them indeed is as if you place your hand upon him and stop the breaking just like its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the bone is broken only at its extremities, then you make it equal to that fracture as much as what was prepared for you from an equation and until the figure of his own naturalness is similar.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the bone is broken at its length or falls towards its interiors; then you place a weakness upon his middle part and until you prepare for him the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you make it equal to that, you place upon her the bandage and then the star from wood or skin; and you draw the band tight over what you do not take long enough the permutation of the fracture, nor the removal of the stars.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And making it equal to that as he extends her bandage so she holds it with the band according to equality; and you place the weakness as he lies down on his back or healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If it happens to him a cold finger; then he stops from its extension and his restoration and until the cold finger rests; and you place upon himself what is seated on itself according to that which preceded, and after that goes back for his restoration, and you draw him as he must be drawn.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If it happens to the thighbone or is broken off; then take them away from there.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Of The Aid For Restoration
Caput XII.	 Of The Aid For Removing The Skull.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The aid is what lies between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it is broken, its restoration follows one of two ways
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 The first way is to obtain a middle plank with the appropriate size, following this pattern
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 Two ligaments are tied at both ends of it.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then, having been suspended from the place where it was broken, he lies down on a bed.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then, holding his fractured arm above the plank, until it touches and passes over the middle of it, where it is attached with a bandage
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Afterwards, he suspends him from above in order to stretch him out gently towards his lower part.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician stretches both of his arms simultaneously, until he is healed and has regained strength, in accordance with what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another way is to have the patient lie on his chest so that he hangs over his own leg, and ties one of his hands around his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 The two physicians take turns supporting him, one holding on to the side of his head that is above his fracture with both hands and the other holding onto his lower leg and stretching each towards its own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if he wants a stronger stretch, then tie him down at the fracture with one bandage and over it with another; and they each stretch towards two sides of his body.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is close to one of the arms, then it must be that a bandage is tied down at the fracture and another over his shoulder.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 If the fracture is close to one of the arms, then it must be that a bandage is tied down at the fracture and another over his shoulder.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Afterwards, when the fracture is equal in ease and without labor, until it becomes equal to what is necessary; then tie her down with a bandage if she does not fall off on her own warmth.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If the fall off of the arm in cold weather occurs earlier than after seven days, then loosen it until after seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 "Strike above the eye with a solution of vinegar and oil mixed; until it falls asleep, then pull it out.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 After striking the mixture on the eye, wipe off the excess using a new cloth.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 After wiping away the excess solution, put your arm above it and place your hand open over your own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And put on the cloth and pull it above your arm so that your arm is in place as a support; if you are not obstructed by something from the other side or behind, nothing should fall upon you from any broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If that should happen and something falls upon you from a broken bone on the other side or behind, then use this support as an anchor; it is so placed to be higher than all others and stronger in order to hold onto it securely with both hands when needed.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And put the support on one side of all the other supports, length-wise with your fingers; the lengths of the supports should be according to their height and with an additional three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 After that, pull on the supports as I explained at first until you have reached your desired height
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is so that your height should be set above the area of the more restricted fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 The length and strength of the supports will increase as the fracture becomes longer and weaker.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you wish the supports and tension to be as we described before when you are ready to restore the limb immediately thereafter do this; if something falls on it while it is still cold, then release the tension and all the remaining supports until the end of seven days like I said before.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 After that, consider the ligament for three days to prevent itching or swelling from happening and to be pressed against it by anything with a body part due to the arrangement of the excess tension.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore rectify everything as I have said before.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are on the edge of falling off due to something from that side, then only release the ligament and after three days at most
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 The nurse lies on her back and puts one hand over her stomach while holding another hand to her breast with the goal of breastfeeding being filled up equally
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And remember during sleep or wakefulness that no broken bone should be fixed and a soft ligature put upon it
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore do this with your own skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And the nurse feeds her patient with a spoon according to our rule so that she will first eat something soft and gradually move on to food of other consistencies until it is time for her to begin eating solid foods: at this point she must consume more nourishing food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 Because of the custom and usage with the spoon it is to be fed for thirty days consecutively; then from this point on it is necessary that she should be fed until her thirst has been satisfied and medicines are applied with ointments which will aid in this.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If there is a broken bone then she should be fed until that ligature and poultices are applied up to fifty days or two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Of the restoration of arm fracture
Caput XIII.	 Head Thirteen.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 Arm is composed of two bones called humerus and ulna.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 Of the thumb bone.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 The other one is large and it is that which is put under a small from below part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore if the larger thumb bone breaks alone or both are broken simultaneously.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore a large thumb bone is broken then the restoration and healing of that one is easy and is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower thumb bone is broken there was a bad break for him and his healing will be difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse if two bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the upper thumb bone breaks then there was a meeting with a doctor for restoration of that one so as to put on a ligature easily and gradually until it is equal in strength.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If the large thumb bone breaks then there should be applied a stronger ligature.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 "You must place a figure on his restoration and also extend his arm above the pulse.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 "The hand must be extended above all the fingers; and to the inferior articular joint with all the fingers, or others: and if a person is lying flat on their back, have his elbow near them, or directly behind them at an appropriate height so that they do not tire from work.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 "Then the assistant should extend their arm from below part, either with their hand, or using a cord.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 "The other assistant should also extend similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 "Then the physician adjusts his mouth to reduce him as much as possible according to better appearance.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 "If there is a fracture of the bones then the assistant should gently move aside any broken parts with your strength in their place.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 "If there is any swelling on his side then gently pull it off and the finger wound should not be a hope for restoration; then find its upper part and remove it according to what we have said about those that are missing.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 "However if there is a fracture with injury I did make the one particular finger for this end; therefore take care of it from that point.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 "If you begin the restoration with a cold hand then take a linen cloth soaked in oil and white, it should be medium between hardness and softness; and tightly wrap this on his head so that when he is done the bandage will not slip off; then remove the wet bandanna and put one prepared plaster on top using flour mixed with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 "Then you put oil on it so that there is a light oil spot next to the fracture which is larger and stronger than the bandage itself.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 "You know that the number of fingers on one arm is six depending on how many you are using; either there be a fracture in only one or two places simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 "Then you put your bandage tighter to the stronger and weaker place of the fracture; also some amount more with the upper or lower one depending on what is written at first.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 "The veins that are squeezed from above a fracture should be covered with wet, soft pads; and they should not be dried up or hardened.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 "Let the thread used to tie the ligature from linen be its own, in between fine and coarse; just as we have tied it with linen.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 "Consider the membrane and ligament after a day has passed.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 "If what you apply is necessary for its correction, just as itching applies to a limb: then let the membrane be rubbed with heated water until the itch ceases and the member is not constricted; after this, repeat tightening.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 "If the tightness has already been softened and removed, like these things, then correct it entirely with your own strength; consider what is to come.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 "If the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the membrane due to excess tightness of the skin, then you should let it be softened more and remove it every few days until the nourishment reaches it; after that tighten it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 "But if what we have spoken of does not come to the aid of those things, then it is not necessary for you to make them wet unless after one day or in alternate days.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 "After that, let your hand be suspended lightly on its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 "And let the neck of it remain equal and be guarded by your strength against being agitated with motion.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 "Let him sleep on its back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 "You know that this fracture is restored after thirty days or two thirty-day periods; and perhaps it may be restored within one hundred twenty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 "Everything was according to the dispositions of its color and strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 "Of how fractures should be healed by hand.
Caput XIIII.	 "Chapter 12: Of Fractures Healed by Hand
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 "You know that the hands of a man and the fingers of his hand are rarely injured in fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 "And it does not happen to him except when there is excessive weariness.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When therefore bones are broken or diseased (i.e., when a bone is fractured or decayed), then the afflicted limb should be placed in a square frame and the seat on top of it shall be level, as if seated.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then he places his arm above that same frame, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then he extends the fractured bones and aligns them as if joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 At that time, it is necessary to place a plaster on his arm and bandage (it) should the hot water have been applied first.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then he places an arrow above it according to its quantity, and you just finished with that in your hand?
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the bone is fractured from below and around it there is no room for plants to grow, then he makes a sphere out of cloth and wraps up the affected limb with that so that the broken limb may heal along with its own plant (or if you prefer: so that the severed limb heals in contact with itself). Then wrap it well with long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 The arrow is from a quiver, which has the softness that you need to apply it on the surface of the plants' body and wrap her with long cloth according to what needs to be done.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the bone is fractured from outside (i.e., if a limb has been cut off), then it should be placed above and another arrow below the plant to its side; and leave your hand open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then he places a bandage as before with his hand extended between them (the fingers) and binds it together with the ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If he breaks any of the bones of his finger(s), then align them as necessary (or if you prefer: according to what is required).
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then he wraps it with a plant and places an arrow at the right side (or if you prefer: at its head) to support the fracture so that it does not move around.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If any of the other fingers are broken as well, align them in sequence and bind them with the healthy finger(s) according to the connection; or bind them all together by extending them one after another (and it is better).
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Upon placing the probe above the object, remove it as we have shown for the finger
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 After your restoration has taken place and after you have placed the object in its correct position with the warm probe, remove it when something is removed from that location following the same procedure as we previously described for removing a finger.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Of the repair of broken leg
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The knee is often fractured and the statement of this fact is obvious because it is turned inwards towards its interior and outwards towards its exterior.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its repair is made in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is drawn tight, while another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 He stretches out over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Afterwards he extends all the ligaments towards her face equally and this when there is a fracture of the bones.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 However if there is a fracture close to the root of the knee, then the ligament towards the face falls away and the other ligament below it.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if there is a fracture close to the knee joint, then he extends towards the lower part of his leg.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Afterwards the surgeon equalizes both his hands with their own saliva until he reduces him according to the similarity of the natural shape: and joins them together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then you have placed the probe and tightened it if no finger was removed.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If something was taken from that location, then you release him for a certain number of days until he is cold enough and return to your care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The tightening of his should be as follows.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is permitted to pass a probe over the fracture that may be broken through it, and fasten this twice or three times securely: excess should not remain attached by it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Afterwards he descends until his heel reaches near its root.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And he enters between the knee and leg towards the lower part of both of them.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then apply excess fat from the side of the thigh
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place the bone fragments on the hip socket and one star over each knee
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then wrap the thigh and upper leg in linen strips, so that they may be tied together tightly.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Begin with the tying of three or four strips around the fracture site at mid-length, and continue to wrap them tight around the thigh and upper leg.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you wrap more tightly with one strip towards the fracture site, make your knot looser and longer, so that it may be easier to apply pressure over time.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then intend for two extremities of thread, as you crossed between the thigh and lower leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie then with three strips that are above
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go downward towards the foot as you tie two of them to make a knot in your ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with both strips and those above tied, such that the other part remains unremoved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release your knot when it remains there such that neither the member nor any other thing comes to harm as a result of its loosening and relaxing.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If anything goes wrong with this,
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore go back to your solution and rectify what went wrong immediately and as described above many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If the bone is broken by another bone, then let you set it so that they are equal if possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, find the other one and remove it from there; remember with whom you preceded until you are cured.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And when the thigh fracture is tied like this, as we have described it to help and arm;
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, while tying his fractures in that manner no impairment of movement occurred.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if restored alone without the other leg, then it is necessary to let him who has been impaired walk in turn always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 The hip is stretched for fifty days or added with a few days, but it can be shortened by the same number of days. It's like that because of different constitution and dispositions of limbs.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 On the restoration of the broken leg (tibia).
Caput XVI.	 Section 16
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 It is known that a rare occurrence of the tibia breaking is a result of excessive effort or injury to it.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If broken by the same reason as before (either a fissure or a hole), then the bone will heal without an opening on its own parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 It is also like that with excessive heat and without excessive cold.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And it grows above all of these things with awareness.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of the above is like that in order to restore what has been disrupted by its own parts with the fingers and continue to be united according to how possible it is from an equation and ease, and made
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is smeared with the skin of sesame oil or groundnut paste and placed over this above, making a round star if desired: and tighten above so that it comes down to match the above.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we mentioned on other fractures as cold hands and similar things to them: so that you may oppose everything with him in how he was able to recover from anything, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On the restoration of a broken leg (crus).
Caput XVII.	 Section 17
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 It is known that the legs are two bones of which one is large and called the crus (the knee) and the other subtle and called the tibia (one bone).
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And the tibia and crus are broken by two different types of fractures in both arms' bones because of that there is an equal restoration for them as for the arm's bone: so it is one operation.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If the tibia and the crus are broken at the same time, then they become connected to each other in every part.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if a subtle bone breaks it becomes connected to the front side.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 "If you break one of your ribs on the top, this will lead to injury below; and it is from those that are not hidden to you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 "Then apply an extension, balance (or equilibrium), and ligature of the stars in accordance with this balance.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 "However, if there is a fracture of the ribs, it being a severe injury; so that its extension may be less than full and to the lesser extent.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 "And indeed in the ribs is from an operation of some over the arm; and it is so when you have equal stars, and complete all your operations; then take two cords of pine wood, which is used in the manufacture of the sun's work, placed under boards: and they are done with palm twigs. And choose those who are superior, and not from minute ones; and their length should be according to the length of the ribs, down to below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 "Then apply over a single piece two solutions in accordance with its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 "And place one part of the ribs on another, and then place another on another; they are done from the knee down to below.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 "Then ligate two cords at three places with two extremities and a middle one.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 "Since the restriction is prohibited, the ribs decline to the right and left, and standing in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 "And indeed, the cuñas (or wedges) of wood are to be applied according to the length of the ribs, and placed into them the ribs so that they can help it with motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 "And above all else is needed, so that you make this when there is a fracture as well.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 "Then consider the ribs every day and study them with him, at the very last of his work from the apostles or others; either by raising it, or by something else.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 "If therefore anything happens from them, then you should bind him with it, as long as he wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 "Of fractures of the arms and hands.
Caput XVIII.	 On the eighth head
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The heelbone is not broken by a fracture of the foot.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 A bone in the foot is broken by a fracture when there are several fractures and not just one; it does not happen to them unless there is attrition due to multiple impacts or blows.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If the footbone is broken, you will see that bone raised above itself to its own arm; then it supports the foot over the ground as a stretcher does.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then you stand there and put the foot on top of that which was raised by them; afterwards praise it, or call it by its name, and equal it with these places: until then she remains in her own place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then you support the stretcher on top of that; and put a small platform under the foot with two flat feet beneath it, which have been given to him by God.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then you tie her with a decent rope; after that you hold her tightly with the cloth, and others to whom she is subject
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 After three or four days then loose the cord.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 You will equalize those bones if they are fractured, dislocated, or just moved around.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is performed upon them as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If any fingers are broken then restore those and equalize them according to what I told you about restoring the hands.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then you put your own finger on the platform according to its length and make it longer than that; afterwards put under the foot the platform I told you about, and tie her with a decent rope.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If the bones from which that finger was broken are two or three or more then you put on top of every one of his fingers a platform of its quantity lined with cloth; and tie her to under the foot: and let her be standing over one footboard outside the foot so that it holds by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And I will tell you that the one who knows all things which I have said to you about the others broken and injured from accidents should not neglect any of them, but oppose every accident with him as it is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On broken bones of women and men
Caput XIX.	 On the head
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is broken, then seat her in a square posture
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then incline her towards the back of her neck and hold her with both hands behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 After this is done by an obsteratrix (a woman trained to break bones), then lay the woman on her stomach with both hands holding her body down and let a ball of cloth be placed under her neck as if supporting it like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 The woman is laid flat (on the ground), and the bones are gently pulled towards each other.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 This will then be supported by a ball of cloth as before so that her head is lowered and the bones are broken.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then the man takes hold of her with both hands, holding her down on her back and breaks her bones again.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Therefore he takes her down gently and moves with ease back to where you broke the bones before; then break them again as they were broken originally, then releases his first hold so that he can grasp it (his body) once more.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 He will perform this seven days in a row or alternate days until the bones are restored to their original state.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if it is not possible, take hold of her hair with both hands and pull the cloth from beneath her neck until she has been pulled all the way up into her vulva (her vagina).
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 After this is done by pulling on the cloth with great force until the hair and cloth are all inside her vulva (her vagina), then she will be broken again.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 After this is done by an obstetrical woman with a cloth and held for several days until it heals as we have described previously.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bones of men or women are broken then he administers to restore them and arranges them as we described before for the Anchae bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not hidden from view that the anus may be injured by those whose strength fails them, but primarily for those with some study or use of anatomy.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 "I have learned much from this book because its fracture means to you the right way in many dispositions for restoration of your own and restriction of your own; therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 "When the bowstring of a man breaks, take the goose-quill [pen] and write it on that place.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then apply a solution with a cloth to it and let it be soaked; then let it be poured out three days or around them if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 For the restoration of the bone when there is a fracture accompanying a wound
Caput XX.	 Head XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It happened to him who had a fracture accompanying the wound, especially if it is large like that of the nose or cheeks or assistant's fingers, so they are brought close and quickly applied by you as we did; but when conditions for phlebotomy [bleeding] are present, do so.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If a wound bleeds from the blood then you must bring them close to making an incision for him; so that you will squeeze over his cheek as we did.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 After this initiate the restoration of the fracture on the same day and do not delay it if an assistant is not present.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If a warm assistant was injured then you leave the restoration of his fracture until the next day until the assistant is settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not come close to him on the third or fourth day since you will bring bad luck upon him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the nose is broken and protruding above the wound then you must bring it down quickly using your hands in a similar fashion as we did; but if you are unable to reach it.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If extension is not available for him and his equalization of hands then bring it down with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 The instrument is made of iron and its length is the number of seven or eight fingers; and its width is according to the amount of blood from the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 Therefore a physician is necessary so that he may receive three, or four portions of the treatment according to the quantity needed for healing all wounds and fractures
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be round, and there should not be excess fat on top of him during the period when he is being pressed down for an operation to take place: and there should also be a sharp edge where the thumb meets the palm of his hand.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And it must extend from his top (forearm) all the way down to its bottom part, including the middle part between them.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is suitable for this operation so that he may place the sharp edge of his hand on the prominent thumb and then grip it with one hand as tightly as possible until after returning its mouth to an equal state or position (i.e., when all the bones are in their proper alignment)
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore, bring both broken limbs into equal positions
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the limbs of his broken arm are soft and cannot be easily held by him with a good grip, then he should try to strike it off with both hands until he has enough strength in each hand.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 Or if you cannot reduce them with him as we have said before, then strike it off with a blow from one side of the head using whatever technique is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then leave what remains after striking it off in that manner on your bones and fingertips
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 After you have reduced the arm, it is likely that the wounded man will experience great pain because his mouth cannot return to its original position or place
Fac ergo illud.	 Therefore do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 But if the injured man experiences a very great pain with your restoration technique, then you will complete his recovery as much as is possible using those techniques of yours.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then plunge it into vinegar and black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And if he is hot (warm).
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 Do not place over the open wound any kind of fat or oil that may cause it to putrefy and become corrupted.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 In the hour of your restoration, you will administer these remedies
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 Remove any blisters that have formed; so that with a knife you may cut through the membranes of the wounds according to their severity.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 Be extremely cautious not to tear the wounds while cutting them open.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 There are many mistakes made by those who have studied this art of medicine; they either killed their patients or themselves through a knife, death from injury, decay from disease - that is, insanity.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 Your restriction must be soft and mild, varying according to the nature of fractures; so you must not force a fracture when it has already occurred
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or great, and certain accidents have occurred over it, we suffer pain; then you must not place those remedies upon it, lest you cause more pain.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make cuts through hard skins at the places of the remedies and tie them up with it.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But if there has been one day or two days and the wounds have already begun to form; then you must wash away that skin over which you placed those remedies with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer the ointments and unguents as per our custom; just like the tetrapharmacopoeia ointment, and others of that sort.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it should be sufficient for you to have one bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the wounds every day and often throughout the night until they heal.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And you must stretch out that member as if it is about to come away from its own weight with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If several days have passed and it has not been healed; do not let the pus come away from it at all; then you know that those bones are small.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, inquire about wounds with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 If those bones are separated; remove them and extract them separately.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And if they are not separated; they penetrate the member and cause pain while cutting through them, and wash away those remedies in every way that is possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 "When a man is suffering from the heat of fever or exhaustion, whether through injury or illness - that is to say, with exhaustion or species related to corruption and putrefaction - at this point you must seek someone who has previously cured him following his narrative in one of his chapters.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 "From that person who is needed to keep me speaking when my face is broken and I am bleeding from the mouth, like a horse's nose, and of advisors, and similar things coming out through large openings in his body, it is necessary that you do not deceive him by giving him your present mind once he has been injured or sick, for many times death comes to him from this condition. Therefore, let them remove him until he decays.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 "Certainly no more than 21 days
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 "Therefore, when you see to your injury and otherwise let him go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 "Concerning the cure of a fractured nose
Caput XXI.	 "Chapter Twenty-one
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 "These treatments for injuries have often led to death.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 "Specifically those which are related to the face and arms:
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 "And in some cases they forbid operating on a natural member.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 "Therefore consider at this point if the nosebleed is severe:
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 "And if you apply these bandages with wine or egg white or vinegar, and tie them on top of the nosebleed, and hold them tight at a good place.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 "Do not keep the bandage for more than many days
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 "Until the bleeding stops.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 "Or tie them with a cloth soaked in water.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 "Water is the property of all that are afraid to leave their bodies.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "If a nosebleed is already hidden by a hand or is very tight and the need to remove it has become pressing due to its harshness:
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 After cleansing when restored, and remove the membrane after that in a subtle way, not according to its own nature
Caput XXII.	 Head II
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When the restoration of a fracture in the bones occurs, and remove the membrane after that in a subtle way, weak: then it does not occur except due to many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the many solutions is ligature and its ligation does not according to what should happen; either due to excess tightness of ligaments or prevent the flow of nourishment towards the membrane after excessive lubrication of the skin: or due to a lack of blood in the body weakness, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the care of this is to feed the weak one, and make his body firm until more blood occurs there.
Et administra balneum.	 And apply a poultice
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour over joy and gladness on him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 After that, put a piece of paper over the membrane to attract much food towards it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And with warm water he applies lubrication frequently until he gets nourishment and recovers his natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 When the restoration of a fracture in the bones occurs broken
Caput XXIII.	 Head XXIII
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When the broken member is already restored after the cleansing of it, its tortuosity and prominence in a fractured bone occur at once, or perhaps it becomes numb: so that you are forced to use this form for both members, but do not allow the membrane itself by its own operation to be done away with; then it is not necessary that you receive speech from him who knows how to break it free.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And many doctors and restorers have done this here on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is truly unbearable in its pain or fear of death, so that it may be called deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 If the numbness and weakness are recent; then it is necessary that he be lubricated with warm water in which have been soaked various soothing herbs such as elder leaves, root, mallow, and others similar to them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 Let him have a bandage softened with oil as if it had been made into a honeycomb
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 A mixture of radish juice and honey should be applied to the affected area, or else grease from birds' fat can be used instead; after it has been softened, then bandage him with that
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 A mixture of elderberries and wax should be applied to the affected area; or else grease from bees' fat can be used instead; after it has been softened, then bandage him with that
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 Sometimes when there is a continuous, strong, and relaxed friction between the hands of one or both patients, it can be relieved by applying a mixture of elderberries and wax to that area; alternatively, grease from bees' fat can also be used instead after it has been softened
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 The motions of the members should go all around the whole body at once
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If the tortuousness has already been done and is strong, causing a sharp pain when it strikes against stone; then let him be relieved by putting out the superior part of his wounds with iron; he should keep on pouring water over them until it subsides or is no longer necessary, after which the superfluous portion from friction or bone with fine incisions may be removed: thereafter, application of ease and diligence will follow.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Of a dislocation of a limb.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter twenty four
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 A dislocation is the separation at a joint's place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Because of his own motion it is prohibited to move him; and the form of the member becomes deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And he brings about sharp pain and useless wounds because of that.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore when a dislocation happens, then it is necessary to hurry up for the restoration of him; do not delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 If he is delayed, then the place may become broken off or reduced in the dislocation itself
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore it should not be moved, nor should an extension take place at that time of his delay; because of this.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because he causes a lot to hurt spasms and suffering wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 Indeed when that happens then it is necessary to hurry up for the taking away of his pain from an illness.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Therefore it is removed, until he be silent
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then apply ointment on the member with warm water and oil
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 And then reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all the members, where its memory is not in place
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already ordered the dislocations of the arms and legs as well as those that preceded them on fracture; from the upper part of his body to the lower one down.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 For the treatment of dislocations of the lower arm.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 Only two of the arms are dislocated, rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And both dislocations occur according to one way.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Either they are moved from their own places by means of some violence or become softened through gentleness.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Either the dislocated arm is made to be complete and unbroken as it was before until it becomes softened up towards the chest, down to its course of descent from the shoulder, until it cannot hold her any longer, nor can it be bent back against the mouth with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation is small then he returns to many positions by himself with a few.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and unbroken then it is necessary to bring about either the reduction of him immediately or delayed by pain; he must make effort to hold on with his hand towards its base which goes through the arm's dislocation; in case that it has been dislocated from one part
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he may introduce both hands simultaneously if the dislocation is from two places.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the rest of his fingers are outside which equalise
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 Then apply a gentle force until he straightens out both arms and frees them for use throughout the body.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician equalises one arm with gentle force and pushes it until he reaches his own place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult especially if both arms are dislocated simultaneously then administer an enema with warm water and oil until a simple reduction of both occurs; do not delay the reduction of both at all unless otherwise instructed.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When this has happened and they become equalized, the jaw is loosened up but does not relax; then there comes a turn of the pliers above the gums, when he strikes it with the oil of roses.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is tightened using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 Then the jaw falls asleep on its back; and his head is held between two pulleys so that it does not move to one side or the other; nor can it chew anything. So he puts food into his mouth gently with a spoon until the pains subside, then the mandible loosens up.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 The jaw does not work properly during eating and drinking; until it is loosened, then it can function normally again.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 When the reduction of the jaws is difficult due to their being dislocated at a certain time and they do not return to their normal positions; then many times fevers occur, and often one is seized by an excess of cold or heat; so it may be necessary for the nurse to soothe him with hot water.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When you know that this has happened, then you realize it is a loss; and many times he dies to whom this occurs within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Of the reduction of dislocations in the elbow joint
Caput XXVI.	 Twenty-sixth part
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The furcula is not dislocated by the lower arm's natural movement, due to its own persistence around the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it can be dislocated on occasion towards the outside; and this fact is declared through inspection of the body.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 Its restoration occurs so that he may lie comfortably upon his back, and he extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then the heart's place is filled with a strong hand squeezing it, as it will be restored.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then he places his hand over the chest and pulls on it strongly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 The limbs follow him closely as they move with him, not being dislocated except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 "When one tooth is dislocated, then it should be reduced and restored to its original position as we have said, and what was prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then put a plaster over the dislocated tooth, along with cotton wool and a strip of bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And apply it gently, so that tranquility and peace may come to restore health.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with the same care, the extremity of the arm is reduced when it has been separated from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 The reduction of a dislocated arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Head 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 It is known that the humerus does not dislocate unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 The first way being dislocated towards the lower part of the titus.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is dislocated towards the chest part.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And sometimes it may be dislocated towards the higher part of the arm, which is rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It does not dislocate towards the back because of the presence of a bursa (fluid-filled sac).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it does not dislocate towards the front because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 It is most frequent to dislocate and reduce towards the lower part of the titus, especially those whose muscles are thin or weak.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Since reducing them quickly or slowly does not make any difference; they may be reduced just as easily when applied gently or firmly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 However, in those whose muscles are many it is to the contrary of theirs since reduction with difficulty may occur for them and also because of reduction with difficulty occurs.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And sometimes when the blow or fall strikes a man and he becomes disabled his arm is amputated close to its place because it had already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore you should proceed in caring for him until you are sure of his condition and then perform your care upon him.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 It is known when the dislocation occurs towards the lower part of the titus and you must distinguish between the dislocated arm and the healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 In between these two extremes there exists a certain degree of difference; and you must apply this to the head of the human body, bringing its concavity into contact with your fingertips as if it were an object held in the hand: and he cannot be made weak so that his arm falls down upon his shoulder, nor can he move it about by all means.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 Similarly, if the jaw is dislocated or turned upwards; then you must apply your finger to it as before so that nothing may be hidden from view.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 This reduction can be made very easy when he is young, or is weak and feeble.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 His reduction is to lift up his hand above himself.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then you put your fingers under his chin and press them together with all your might towards the top; and he lifts up his arm so that it reaches above itself; and he extends his hand upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then you put her downwards beneath him, but he immediately pulls her back up again.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not recover from this as we have said and there are many days of dislocation at the beginning; then it is necessary that he be bathed in warm water, and embrocation should be given which soothes and relieves, just like if you pluck up the roots of a plant, or the chaff from grain, and the millet from the water, and administer.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then you support him on his back; and put under the chin of him a sphere and wool which is equal in relief from pain to pressure.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician supports his foot on the sphere; and he lifts up the arm of the sick person with force; and he pulls down the hand of him to beneath.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another one holds his head so that it does not move downwards; but immediately he pulls back himself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 If he is weak and feeble, reduce him to this extent; and it will be as if you have made the present man who is longer stronger than before, and so remain on one side, and he puts his arm beneath with the fingertips of him to the sick person; and he lifts up the finger of him towards above until the patient is supported by the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 Another physician should examine his lower limbs
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the patient is weak or ill, then he needs to be kept suspended in some way so that something else can be done for him; because dislocation occurs quickly.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And also according to another method, he is positioned on a long stick with a round head like that of the dead; so as not to be heavy or thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Afterwards, he is placed under a long stick after being positioned on the head of it with a linen cloth; and the patient will be standing according to the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Afterwards his hand is extended towards the lower part on one side and his body is extended from the other side with force; because the union occurs at its place, either by chance or fate.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction of him is difficult through everything we have said, then use this remedy; and it is that you take a stick whose length is equal to two of his arms, width as much as four fingers, thickness as much as two digits on each hand, with a round head so that an entrance into deepness may be made, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Afterwards the linen cloth is placed over the rounded head of it, so as not to be heavy.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Afterwards he is placed under the stick so that his hand can be extended or both his arms towards it to the lower part; and the stick is fastened over his elbow, and arm and the extremity of his hand are also fastened.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Afterwards one arm is placed over the rungs of a ladder according to its length; and his hand is extended towards the lower part, and the suspended body is released from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The union occurs quickly.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Therefore the entrance into him is completed according to whatever method is possible; then it is necessary that you place under this spherical stick equal in quantity of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Afterwards a prepared plaster is placed over his forearm and back with olive oil and egg white as was done above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 "And then the ligature was tied tightly beneath a decent incision; and after some time the ligament ascended over the emplastron; and it became attached to his hand at its top; and it was released, that no part of his hand should move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 "And then the ligature should be tied to a thin thread, that it might endure for a long time; because its location is in relation with his cure.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 "And then the ligature should be loosened after seven days or five, and it should be stretched along with a motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 "If at this point it is tight but not loose, he has now recovered.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 "If the ligature should come loose excessively because of moisture that affected him or some other cause; then it is necessary to administer it with a cautery with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 "If this should happen in its entirety and the ligature is loosened after seven days and does not tighten up; the emplastron and the incision over it are contracted a little bit more than before and do not let go, so that his hand cannot be lifted upwards; you know now that the nerves of his arm at the top have already been cut or stretched out. And you also know that the ligature never appears in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 "And the dislocation that occurs with the breast and nipple or downward reduction; it happens along with a motion and stretching out with hands until it is over, after which the remaining ligature should be released and treated with the rest of the treatment, so as to recover.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 "If after the cure there is a heaviness and slowness of his motion; then it should be administered with strong cold compresses frequently until its heaviness is relaxed and he returns to his natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 "The treatment of dislocations of the cubitus.
Caput XXVIII.	 "Chapter 28: The Treatment of Dislocations in the Cubitus.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 "You know that the ligature of cubitus comes loose with difficulty and is also released with difficulty; and in fact it even comes loose at all parts, and especially to the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 The dislocation of it is hidden from you because it falls under your care and control, according to whatever figure or position it may be in.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you bring the dislocated limb together with a healthy one, that is clearly declared to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 A union occurs between joints and cannot double or touch it while holding the other arm.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you should prevent or correct the dislocation as soon as possible before frostbite sets in.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If frostbite occurs to him, it is difficult for him to reduce or cure all of it, especially if he falls on his back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 A dislocation in general is worse than any other injury and often leads to death among these people.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The restoration of it when possible to reduce is like this: extend your hand with two hands and bring his arm up, the medical staff should be over the dislocated limb below him so that he can pull himself back towards where he was before.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or the dislocation is to the front: then he reaches out like that so that his second hand strikes against his dislocated arm while reaching for its palm with both hands until it hits where it was before.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If not reduced by dislocation then administer an intense strengthening and extending of both hands until the arm is brought out strongly and held tightly, with two assistants holding it while another holds it tight at its other end to prevent it being pulled away.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm comes back to all parts after it has gone over his shoulder and is held by a long sleeve or wide bandage on one hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the medical staff holds his arm together with oil to make it easier for those who assist in lubricating the joint and making things go smoother.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pulls himself back by pulling forcefully until done.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction of his arm is to place it on top of that splint where there is stiffness and pain with a bandage as well, to tighten it properly.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 The arm is suspended from the shoulder, and it falls after several days
Deinde soluatur.	 Then one solves it
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If therefore the connection is formed at its place, then one loosens the ligament from there, and releases her.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 If you are unable to form a good connection then one repeats the plasters and loosens the ligament after several days until it is formed.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then releases her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If any damage to the patient has occurred after reduction of the connection and there is pain during its arrangement in motion then administer humidification by bathing, and the use of a thin brush for friction, and compression. Until it straightens out or someone holds up their arm at that point (i.e., until it heals).
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then he is bound and she is released after a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then you take them out of the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 After bathing, friction is applied to the connection with heated friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then one repeats her over and over again until she straightens out in the bath.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if there is someone else to hold up her arm, then you apply a warm compress with butter and tight it over him (i.e., put the warm compress on top of him).
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this occasionally.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 Her is stretched out and she returns to her own position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 This concerns the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 The 29th chapter
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Many hands that have been dislocated are caused by the connection between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 Reduction of their dislocations is easy for them.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 When one has connected many things to many things.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However it is necessary that the arrangement of dislocations be done at a time before they are separated from their place or before cold comes into play (i.e., before they become cold).
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 Then reduction of dislocations is done with the weak hand on top of a table, and he stretches out his sick hand at that place. And if someone holds up her arm then the medical practitioner applies their palm over the connection, and pushes it until she is released (i.e., until they are released).
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, when the hand has already withdrawn towards the center and lays its back on a table before extension and reduction: if dislocation occurs in this manner to the palm of the hand, then it is placed by itself at that point over the table, so that only its interior part lies above the table, that is, its interior part is placed there, with the surgeon's hand placed above it.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 Therefore, if it is returned promptly, this is good: and if not, then bind her with a bandage immediately; release him to prevent repetition of this error.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it does not tolerate the reduction well and you can't perform the reduction correctly after a day or more, however, the incision will remain as is according to its own tortuosities: but nothing else should be done that would harm the hand; and it cannot bind anything; therefore, know that there are slips.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no cure for this injury except to tie her up with caution as close to the point of its injury as possible.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps nothing else should be done.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Therefore if it does not return to Almahassim immediately, then put the bandage over him covering as much of his body as possible.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then bind her and release her after five days; afterwards it will be treated and released again, and the hand is exercised
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If the motion of his part is held back and it becomes infected there or something else happens to cause him harm; then tie her down with a heated water bath, and apply friction gently until he gets better
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Of the treatment for dislocated fingers
Caput XXX.	 The head of the textbook.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from its place or the palm towards it; then extend it and pull against your fingers until it goes back into place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 After this, you support the head of the finger and tie it down to where it was dislocated; and release it after two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 "Then hold him down and stretch him out until he becomes equal in length with his other side on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 "When this has been done at night or by day [while it is light], hold him according to the same order and do not let go of him until he exercises himself completely; stretch him gently.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 "Do this on several days until he becomes accustomed to stretching.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 "And do the same thing with him if his hand becomes dislocated; hold him to the opposite side and perform your first operation until he is cured.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 "And do the same thing when one of his other parts becomes dislocated.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 "About the treatment of dislocations in the back muscles.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 "When any of the back muscles is dislocated either completely or partially, and they fall out at their places; there is no treatment for this because death comes quickly to one who is weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 "His sign is that ejection by force cannot be prevented without strength; and some of his parts are separated from him one at a time.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 "In many cases, the removal takes place such that they are removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 "And what is dislocated towards the back is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 "The treatment for him is as follows, considering that gibbosity occurs during childhood; there is no cure at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 "However what is dislocated due to a blow or from similar causes; the ancients have spoken many ways of treatment in their books.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 "Which one does not return with strength.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 "I am returning to him from that place; and my excuse for having been at a great distance is because of the proximity of mine intention: I stretched it out in this way, and made an instrument of it one way by which they removed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore I say that injury occurring at a point below the previous part is not an accident but skill
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 Similarly, for one below two sides
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it does not occur from these except when the injury occurs in the back itself, as I say and is that the injured part goes up to the face above the platform at a level equal to or towards the wall; and it expands below on a moist cord so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a fixed rod of wood is placed in the foot into the earth, at its extreme; and another rod around the feet at the other side below; and it holds the wood so that it does not move from the foot.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And then it holds both rods separately.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then it stretches the upper part of the ligaments tightly and firmly; and it extends the end of the ligament to the rod that is at the head of him; and it binds it on this.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then it stretches another ligament above his ankles, and above both of his knees; and at the heels of him.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then all ligaments are tied together on one rod that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then it stretches all ministers to the end of the wood that is by his feet; but two rods are not fixed tightly so as not to be moved from where they are tied.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 Then the physician places his hands above the spine with strength; until he gives out or places a tablet on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then both of his feet are placed over the tablet so that they may give rest to him.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If however he does not recover through this treatment then he takes a tablet whose length is around three arms
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And the place where we said that it was necessary for him to be in order to get well quickly is at which end of the tablet he will be placed
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then he places a middle piece of the tablet on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 The surgeon places his feet apart for another patient
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 He ties the legs well and releases the spinal cord, then moves to its place
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 After that he takes the other hand as a tool and operates on it with his own hand like before; so now you are to place your feet at his head under two lines, whose length is equal to the forearm of one arm: then you must place both legs at his head underneath two lines.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 The length of every line between the two fingers is equal; and it has been done at all places where the cord moves through a hole; then each line will be buried deeply into the earth so that nothing will move any longer.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 A rounded cord is introduced; and now the opening of which two lines was previously closed by the ligaments, will be reopened by it through these same two holes.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 At the extremity of it is a hole where the cord is bound; its length is equal to the distance between your fingers when you previously operated on them, and in these two lines there is also one similarly large.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then, tie the ligaments which you previously tied around his throat as a tool where it is at his head; and the ligaments which you previously tied around his arms in this tool where they are at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 And then the surgeon ties around every cord with his own hand, as he did before when using the tool; and he equally stretches the spinal cord according to what we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is how it ends.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 After the surgeon has stretched and arranged the cord, then you must place a pair of clean tweezers with new linen onto it.
Deinde stuppam.	 That is all.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Afterwards place a star on top of the cord from a tablet whose length is three digits to one side, or going around them
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 Its length should fit into the space reserved for [the] swelling and above the healthy part of the cord.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament we mentioned earlier.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 "The sick one is healed with subtle nourishment.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 "If the ailment is removed from its place at the end of treatment (i.e., cured), then it's necessary to use medicines that alleviate and calm down, in conjunction with administering a table as we have taken long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 "And now, when administering the wet sheet.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 "When an ailment occurs at the end of the spinal cord (i.e., a stroke), and it is placed through this dislocation, and it is that thing which has already come out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 "Therefore, it's not necessary to use such a medicine with this remedy, lest he die prematurely.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 "Of the treatment of dislocated ankles.
Caput XXXII.	 "Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 "Know that the fracture of an ankle and the fracture of the arm did not occur unless dislocation occurred; nor would it happen to them who experienced other dislocations from a remote distance.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 "The fracture of the ankle is broken into four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 "This because it is dislocated to anterior and posterior.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 "It's very common for the dislocation of the inner part; and only a little bit is dislocated from anterior and posterior.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 "The treatment of the dislocation to the inner part is necessary; because when you put a healthy leg on an unhealthy one it's longer and the limb which has been injured becomes more than the healthy limb but can not double foot itself under the knee, for the place where the hip is dislocated from below.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 "The mark of that dislocation which occurred to external part was a contrary incident.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 "The sign of that dislocation which occurred to the front part was expansion of the healthy leg in conjunction with the complement; however it does not double itself except for pain who is at the knee: and if he walks to move forward, can't go over from anterior; and urine of them will be retained, and the other leg will be bent down, and above the heel there is a sliding motion.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The finger which it struck dislocated backwards was, so that it did not extend the knee; nor could it double itself before doubling the other joint of the same finger; and its nail is short on one side, while its heel is longer on the other; and its joint at this place in particular.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation is to be considered there when it has already taken place and become old with its possessor.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer the reduction of this dislocation according to his disposition, then at that time there is no overall care present for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not allow him to be puffed up with pride.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In that other person whose dislocation is recorded in the same place as four dislocations; then you should proceed to this at once and join them together, and extend one of them to its interior and exterior, and move both hands so they can each be separated or united: for perhaps it has already returned, and no need for another care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If he does not return in this way then one should prepare a strong instrument and extend his leg from below, either with both hands or using a cord which is tied over his foot above the knee: and another person extends his hand on top of him so that they can get in touch with their fingertips.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then he holds it with a slack cord above the root of the thigh and keeps hold of the other person's hand.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And his extension can be towards the front of the leg or towards the back of the thigh.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 Then their extension should all be from one direction until they are supported by his body on the ground and remain suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 This is the kind of extension that is common to four different cases.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If he returns the dislocation as we said then it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to attend to all that I have already spoken about in relation to one's own care.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of him when his dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary that he be supported by a sound limb on the outside.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 The ligature is placed above the acetabulum of the hip joint; it passes through the hole that exists between the head of the femur and the acetabulum and ends at the place below the groin
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligature to its upper side toward the more superior part of the body towards the shoulder blade.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Next a stronger ligature is applied to his forearms and makes a large hole in the weakened acetabulum by stretching it with an external forceps.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 I am returned to my place
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 This is the most suitable method for reducing this member compared to other methods of reduction.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If the reduction fails on you and does not reach your thigh when using this method with all its force, then it is necessary that both your feet are fastened together at once with a strong ligature while holding onto one of them with gentle care, above two calves and above two thighs: and let the length be as proportional to four digits of each hand extended. And let the foot of the patient extend further than the other two fingers by the amount of their length combined.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then let it be suspended above his head on a stake that is in the house; and its length from earth should equal the amount of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then tighten the strong arm of the patient so that it may lift his hip; and let another person hold him down while you are pulling with force as much as possible towards its place, since the ligature has been tightened together with its own weight.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In the reduction of him when there is a dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that he be suspended above the platform as we specified while having the weight.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And fasten the ligature over his foot and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two stakes are placed: one under each of his feet and another under his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a third stake is placed between his hips so that it does not drag downwards towards the inferior when extended.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 "Then the surgeon extends his own hand and the physician cuts away the flesh with his.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it is performed on healing, then it is good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, the surgeon puts his own bandage over her and presses down equally hard as we described for bruises
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 But it is necessary that the patient may lie on top of a clean cloth with both hands extended.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it should be that the foot of the patient is extended either to one side or the other; and according to this same narration over the table the physician puts his right hand on the leg of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then he supports him with one other hand and also with that same support pushes him out towards the lower side to the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is towards the rear; then it should not be that he is extended to the lower side but he must be lifted up onto the ground so that he may be placed upon a hard surface as we described in our previous narration, and also let him remain on his face and extend the ligaments according to what we said previously.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression is given with the bandage also over to the place where it will be applied and closed together with the reduction according as it has been said.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And you should not cover up the sign of his reduction and let him extend both legs of the patient; when you see them equally extended he will stretch out his foot towards himself without any bending, then you know that now it has been reduced according to what is necessary: at this time you unite the two knees, put a bandage over him, bind with tightness, i.e., rotate as follows so that he does not come loose from one part of anything and must stay secure for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then remove the bandage and the splint, compare both legs with each other; if you see them equally extended then you know that the dislocation is now fixed; absolutely therefore he must be pushed to walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 "If you wish to do something for treatment (cure), then remove that thing and put it aside; in three days if necessary.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 After removing this, let it stay for a period of time to be carried about on both sides until it is well tolerated over several days
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 "Of the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Head (the 33rd).
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It can be dislocated from the outside, inside and downward (inferior) towards the back (posterior).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it cannot be dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The mark of a dislocation is that his knee gives way and he applies both legs towards each other (crosses himself).
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If the knee does not give way, then you know that it has been dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 The restoration of all the modes of dislocation is that you make him lie still until he extends his leg if he can, and holds your back to his face; and puts one foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Afterwards, press down on the knee with both of your hands and arrange them between your fingers above his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 After that you apply one hand two times to each side of the dislocated knee while exerting force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 Another person extends his foot until he gets back on top with both legs.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The mark of the restoration is that you hold down the leg while exerting force without excessive effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Afterwards, you press down on him and apply both legs.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 After that, stretch it while lying there for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	 Afterwards, let go of her (the dislocated knee).
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 Until it is well tolerated over several days.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If you cannot reduce the dislocation yourself, then apply a strong pull with ligaments; whose procedure precedes narration in the treatment of dislocations until it is restored.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 "On the cure for dislocations of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 The 14th book.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel can be dislocated by a sudden blow or it can come out of its place when the foot is forced forward.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Or it may be dislocated inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The mark of a dislocation is that the swollen heel comes off when pushed towards one side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The cure for dislocation of the heel consists in gently pulling it back with the hands until it is restored to its place and held firmly there; then release it when ready to return.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 When the heel is dislocated as mentioned before, you should support it with your hand or hands, hold firmly and let a strong person pull forcefully to its back part until it returns to its place on that side of the foot; then release and let it fall gently to where it was before.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold him with your right hand at the top of his foot and with your left hand at the bottom; then release both hands to allow him to return to its place near the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 And then release him using both hands on his left side near the heel.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend with your left and push gently at the top of the foot with your right towards its back until it returns to its place near the heel without exertion or effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this again just as we did before.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push gently at the top of the foot towards its back with your right hand and pull him with both hands on his left side near the heel again.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If the heel is restored to its place once, do this again either by doing both sides one after another or with two hands in that manner and you see the foot is equal; if not then repeat the treatment until he returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the treatment is not allowed by you when doing as we did before; then let him fall limp with his back to the ground and hold a firm pillow on the floor at its head until it falls between your legs near the heels of both feet; you have already pulled over him from above so that he does not fall further.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 After this the surgeon should take hold of his patient's arm and stretch out the other limb either with both hands or by means of a rope which is tied around the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 After this the surgeon should stretch all his limbs out as far as he can reach with both hands or by means of a rope which is tied around one foot to prevent him from being drawn towards the other side during stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 After this the surgeon should equalize his own limbs with both hands and hold the healthy foot down to prevent him from being pulled towards the other side during stretching.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 The dislocation was corrected with traction (stretching).
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation is corrected and declared to be restored to you, then stretch out with a band and hold it tight, tie him down with his own ligature around the foot.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it should be that you stretch upwards from below the heels towards those above, making sure not to put too much tension on them so they don't tear apart and relax them as well.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 After this let him rest for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the ligature becomes loose tie it back down and let him rest for three days or four. Otherwise, prohibit them from walking on their injured limb for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If after this there is no security or if the dislocation comes loose and becomes unstable again, it will be unsafe to put him back into use for that part until further notice as well.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If his hand is cold then you should administer to him a warming agent and let the story be continued elsewhere as well until that part of the treatment is done
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 The cure for the dislocated finger.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 55
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is required that they are equalized with stretching and little effort; it's just not difficult, but it's easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is caused by a knot on the back of the foot then it should be let him rest with his own foot above the ground or table; he will stay like this while being stretched.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you hold it and fasten a leg over this thing which comes from those stitches
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then bend that with your foot as it were bent to it until it gives way, and straighten out the idea when it is equalized so that there is no appearance of prominence
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then you place a table under both his legs to support him fully while holding on tight with your feet as if holding the two halves together.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then stretch him out slowly over three days in a comfortable manner.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then let it lie still and make him rest from walking around for many days until he is stretched out and secured through stretching.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Of dislocations of the joints or broken bones.
Caput XXXVI.	 Head.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 If something happened to him and you take care of his health, restore him, many will die; thus one should not allow them to surpass the care given to him for this reason that he is skilled in long use, merciful, patient, not greedy or boastful: so may it be in the healing art to heal coldly with medicines: so that a divine judgment might remove from their illness.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless he is free of any sin or pride, or his heart is full of pity and patience.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 So make the care for him at the beginning of things before it falls into cold hands.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If he has recovered his limb as you wish, then administer a course of treatment to him that is applied by the cold hands; and care for them with what was given to him from drying ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a break and the bones are separated then care for the elimination of these; and make it as we said in simple things from him where he was preceded by them.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And hold on to it with your strength and protect yourself from being shaken by fear; according to what I have said before you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 That is better for you near your Creator and more lasting to glory; that is more healing for the body of those who are with you in this time
