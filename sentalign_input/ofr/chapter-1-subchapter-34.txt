Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the anus, one or more, and are old and consist of large cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have described in divisions/sections, and it is not effective, then make cauteries:
Three on the spine, the one that is furthest outside, beneath the shoulder blade little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery below the navel two fingers;
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and one sees swelling in the face, then make a large cautery on the stomach, as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the key-shaped cautery;
and leave the cautery open for a long time.
After, treat the area until it is healed.
