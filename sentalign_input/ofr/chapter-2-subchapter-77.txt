of returning the marrow to its place
Here follows the shape of the press, with which one squeezes the books; and it has two screws at the two ends of the two cords.
However, the screws should be more slender than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood; and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the shafts one finger, and a palm and a half long; and amidst the two cords, there should be two attachments of this same wood, which are fastened to one and the other, half a palm long or a little more; and these two attachments are inserted into the opening of the marrow to open it when the two screws are turned.
Another form, similar but more slender and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling tongs; and it has at the two ends two attachments, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide; and when you want to open the marrow with the whole instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging and her legs open, then insert the two joined attachments into the marrow, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then open your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs similarly, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the marrow, until the midwife does what she needs to do.
These instruments are all excellent, and their forms are multiplied; and when the physician has prepared them, the work is that much faster, and more valuable to people because of their quantity.
So do not disregard the instrument without having it prepared, because the need for them is not excusable.
