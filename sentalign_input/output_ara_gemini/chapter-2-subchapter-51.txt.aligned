Chapter fifty-one on the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen	CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE. On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.	0.76191163
Warts, called fungal warts due to their resemblance to fungi, frequently appear on some people's stomachs and other parts of their bodies. Their base is thin, and their head is thick, with inverted lips. Some are small, while others become very large.	Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.	0.8718129
I have indeed seen a man with two warts on his stomach, resembling fungi exactly, white, with a thin base and inverted, cracked lips, constantly oozing moisture.	I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles. Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them.	0.783813
I cut them off, and I estimated the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.	I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.	0.8623317
The procedure for removing them is to examine the patient; if the patient is of a moist constitution and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, then cut it with a wide scalpel, keeping cauterizing irons at hand in the fire, as often profuse bleeding occurs when cutting them, so be prompt. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it.	This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel. But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage. So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them.	0.8733895
If you find the patient is cowardly and fears cutting with iron, take a tightly twisted lead thread and tie it around the wart with these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead. Continue tightening the lead whenever it affects the wart, until it cuts off and falls by itself without any effort.	On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days. Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble.	0.82457936
If the wart is thick-based, cutting it involves some risk and danger, especially those located on the stomach. However, it is possible to cut off half or part of it and then cauterize it to prevent its recurrence.	But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly. Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.	0.8643489
Then treat it until the wound heals.	Then dress until the wound is healed.	0.8749315
Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, has little sensation, and has an unpleasant appearance, as it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.	But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours. I shall soon be mentioning cancer.	0.7398073
