On the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Chapter 93.
This vein forms in the legs in hot lands, like Alizegi, the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, where no grass or trees grow.
And it may perhaps form in other places of the body besides the legs.
Its formation indeed is due to decay that occurs beneath the skin, similar to how serpents and ascarid worms occur within bodies and worms form between the skin and flesh.
The sign of the beginning of this veinâ€™s formation is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the area becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When its end appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead weighing from one to two drachmas, and knot it, letting the lead hang from the leg.
Thus, whenever something from it comes outward, wrap it in lead and knot it.
If it becomes too long, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before it is entirely extracted.
For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh, causing an abscess, decay in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until its very end is reached, leaving nothing of it in the body; in some people, this vein emerges with a length of five and ten palms.
It has even been reported to me that it came out twenty palms long in one man.
If it is cut during your treatment, then insert a probe into its hole, pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all the matter within is evacuated, and treat the decay in the area with medicines for a few days.
Then treat it as you would for abscesses.
This vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, and it has many openings, with a branch emerging from each opening.
Therefore, treat it as we have described in the section, and with what has been previously stated.
