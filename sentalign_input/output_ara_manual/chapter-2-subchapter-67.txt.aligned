On the hernia that is in the groin.	On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.	0.6476687
A hernia may occur in the groin, as we have said, and the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the testicles. And if it does descend, it is a small amount and returns at all times.	Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes. No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.	0.761812
But if it continues for a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and omentum descend into the scrotum, and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we have said. That is, the peritoneum stretches and then relaxes, and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is with cautery, as I have previously described.	But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum. It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells. Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.	0.9145847
It can also be treated with iron in this way: The patient lies on his back in your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely for a length of three fingers, then you pack the peritoneal layers that are under the skin.	Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects.	0.7352569
Until the white peritoneum underneath it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then sew the two protruding parts on the edge of the probe from the peritoneum and attach one to the other with the stitching.	Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture. Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen. Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.	0.74421954
Then remove the tip of the probe and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then treat it with the treatment of wounds.	Then take out the probe. On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia.	0.8238087
When the sutures have dissolved, clean it and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion does not increase.	Then dress the wound, and when the stitches come apart remove them and bandage the wound again until it is healed over. For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.	0.6447258
Cauterization is better in this area because it is closer to a cure.	But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.	0.6111822
