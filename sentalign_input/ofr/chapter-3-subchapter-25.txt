of the splint/sling
The splint cannot dislocate inwards from the side of the arm and chest, but it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and one feels it clearly.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back and extends his arms;
and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it;
and the head which is towards the elbow cannot dislocate;
at least not easily, and if it does dislocate at any time, then put it back in its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and tighten it, and tell the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way the head of the shoulder is reset, when it is separated from its place.
