of the cautery of the head
When a sudden pain comes in one part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by cleansing medicines, and the other treatments that I mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this is not effective: then make cauteries for him in two ways, that is to say with a sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can put the clove of garlic under the skin; and when it is put in, bind it and tighten it well and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then untie it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then put on cotton dipped in butter until pus comes out.
Afterward treat it with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery with iron is in this manner.
Heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the shape of a nail where it has a little curvature, and in the middle has a small appearance; and place it on the painful spot, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, so that half the thickness of the skin is burned; and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and from which an abundance of blood flows.
Afterward, put cotton in salt water, and place it on the spot for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter there, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed; and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellar", use just the tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
