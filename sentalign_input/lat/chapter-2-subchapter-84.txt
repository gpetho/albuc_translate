On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter 84.
I have already spoken in the section on wound treatment which pertains to the book, and here I will describe their treatment manually and with medicines in full.
I say, therefore, that wounds vary depending on what causes them and the place where the wound occurs.
Thus, the objects that often cause wounds are things like the throw of a stone, the cut of a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, wood, arrow, and similar objects.
Wounds that occur in different parts of the body include wounds on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar parts.
And I will narrate the treatments of certain wounds, to establish a rationale and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, as the mention of complex wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say, therefore.
When a simple head wound occurs and there is no fracture of the bone, consider then if it is from the throw of a stone or something similar, and it has only broken the skin: if the wound is large and you fear a hot abscess forming, then proceed quickly and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; do not delay this, and extract blood according to the patient's strength, if there is no contraindication to phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood coming from the wound.
And let the phlebotomy be done on the side opposite to the wounded area.
And the patient should avoid overeating, wine, and heavy foods.
If there is something preventing bloodletting, then reduce the food intake, and avoid meat and wine.
And if a hot abscess forms on the wound, apply a cooked compress soaked in rose oil alone or with wine containing astringency.
If you are free from concern about a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not yet been affected by the air, a powder I will describe shortly; if the air has already altered it, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
If the wound is large or caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not come together with compresses, then bring them together with sutures, as I will describe in the treatment of abdominal wounds.
If the wound is already exposed to the bone, is hanging, and only held in place by a small attachment, then cut it off.
Then treat the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods with substantial nourishment, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar foods.
If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all the rotten part and remove it; then treat it.
If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then locate the artery.
If you find it unsevered, then cut it with a Spatumili or tie it.
If necessity demands when what we mentioned does not work, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light: simply apply this powder over them, as it heals them before the air can affect them.
The Method of the Healing Powder.
Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unslaked lime; grind it all thoroughly and sieve it. Fill the wound with this powder and bind it tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with compresses and leave it undisturbed, not loosening it while it remains, so that it does not form an abscess.
For the medicine should not be removed until it is healed.
Sometimes lime alone suffices when you do not have frankincense or dragon's blood at hand, as it can perform the same function in many large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it and bind them, provided the wounds are fresh with their blood and have not been affected by the air.
But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially in summer, then this powder should not be used: instead, treat it as we have said, applying certain digestive ointments or barley poultices made with water and honey until they discharge pus.
Then continue with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
If, however, the wound also causes a small fracture in the bone, then extract it with a forceps; I will soon describe the treatment for fractures of the head in what is to follow.
On Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter 85.
If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in its treatment and the treatment of a simple head wound.
But if a nerve or artery in the neck has been cut, and it is a nerve, there is no clever solution other than to avoid treating it with anything that strongly contracts, like ziniar, zegi, and similar substances.
For they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold at all on the wound, because the nature of the nerves is cold and connected with the brain, which is the most elevated of the organs; the treatment should be gentle, using medicines such as washed lime in sweet water, sometimes infused with oil or rose oil, and tutty washed also in sweet water, and other minerals treated in this way, along with moist ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer sutures or draw its edges together with compresses.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If the wound is deep or has formed a cavity in its lower part where pus has accumulated, then pierce it at the most depressed part.
If an artery is cut in the wound and blood flows, then separate it, cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity demands.
If the vertebrae of the throat or all of it are cut, and the respiratory passage is intact, then bring the edges of the skin together with sutures over the windpipe, do not touch the throat; instead, align it and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with an appropriate bandage and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; if there are bone fragments, extract all of them or as many as you can, and leave what cannot be removed until the wound becomes purulent and the fragments separate and come out easily.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder I described.
If bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with the method mentioned in its own chapter.
On the wound in the shoulder blades.
Chapter 86.
If there is a blow from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
If, therefore, air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it does not have depth, and it is fresh with its blood, then do not apply powder in the first hour, nor tighten it, so that blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart, killing the patient. Instead, put drawing ointment on it and open it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not available, then place old cotton at the mouth of the wound to draw out the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound so that what collects in it flows out.
If three or more days have passed for the wound, and the patient has not had spasms, no bad heart tremor, nor difficulty in breathing, and you see that the rest of his condition is good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat it with linen cloths and other treatments until it is healed.
If its healing is delayed and it now remains open, then know that it has become a fistula.
Therefore, treat it according to its type.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it as previously mentioned, with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if it has made an impression on the bone and fragments have broken off, then examine the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
If they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for extraction will be easier.
For other wounds occurring in other members, the treatment is as we have discussed.
