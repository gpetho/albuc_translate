When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its perimeter.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.85984445
Wise men say it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center, but I have not seen this done, as I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen this happen sometimes.	Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.6914558
It is better to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.8273243
