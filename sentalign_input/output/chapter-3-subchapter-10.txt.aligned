Of the fracture of the hip bone	On setting a fractured hip.	0.5321438
It rarely happens that the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, it is only a slight thinning at the head; and it fractures lengthwise, and bends inward, and the patient feels pain at the spot, and sharpness, and the fractured part swells.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.8740855
And the restoration is that you place your hand on it, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape; and if the fracture is at the head only, then set that fracture evenly, so that it is in its natural shape.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is. If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.74158216
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it bends inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the poultice, then place a splint of wood or leather on it, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move; and fill the spot under the ribs, so that the bandage is even.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.8423431
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.548198
And if a hot abscess occurs there, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is soothed, and apply what we have mentioned before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there are no bad accidents; and this is the method.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be. If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.7234129
