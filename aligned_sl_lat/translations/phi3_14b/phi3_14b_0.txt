After I have completed this for you, my son, the book which is the last in medical knowledge with its complement, and reaching the end within it from those expositions and declarations themselves, I wished to complete it for you along with this Treatise that is a part of surgery - namely, operative chirurgery by hand.
Since the art of manual surgery was abandoned in our region and time altogether, until perhaps the knowledge itself has vanished and its trace is gone: only small descriptions remain from it among ancient books, which hands have modified: to them errors occurred and hesitations until their intentions were closed off, and extended their own will: I saw that I should vivify it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to positions, declarations, and abbreviations, and so that I would come with forms of instruments for Cautery and other operative tools: coming from additions to its declarations and necessary adaptation.
However, because a good artisan of it with his hand is not found in this time, as the art of medicine is long and requires an author to exercise it before that knowledge in anatomy which Galen narrated - until he knows injuries of members, their forms, and connection and separation among them, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, numbering of those, their exit and arrival, pulsatile ones and calmness, and the locations of their exits.
And for that reason Hippocrcuas said: a name with its own name is much, and little with the work, especially in manual art.
However, we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Since who is not aware of what we have spoken about anatomy cannot be purged unless it already falls into error from which people perish: as I saw many formed from this science and boasting themselves without knowledge or experience.
What it is that I saw a stupid doctor cut an abscess of the groin of a woman and accidentally severed some arterangs in her neck, so that the blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another doctor who intended to remove a stone from the testicle of an older man, and the stone was large. Therefore he approached him and removed it with a bladder pouch. Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physcian who received payment from someone among our Duke's servants because of the medicine: and it happened to an eunuch, who was black, near him, that he had a fracture in his thigh close to the calcaneum: and the doctor hurried due to his ignorance, and pressed the fracture over the wound with filth, and with strong bands, and did not allow the bleeding of the wound.
Then he released him according to his own desire. Later he dismissed him after several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and it stayed thus until a tumor formed on his leg, and his foot, and came to ruin.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and peace ensued, and he was relieved from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become confirmed in the limb: and I could not contain it anymore.
Therefore the corruption ceased to walk on the limb until he died.
And I saw another physcian who pierced through the cancerous tumor: and it was ulcerated after days, until its wickedness grew greatly with its owner.
Which is because when it is a pure cancer from the black bile, then one should not come near it at all with iron unless it is in a body that can bear it, so as to be entirely severed from its own matter.
And because of this, my son, it is necessary for you to know that the surgery with hands is divided into two divisions: namely, the division associated with health and the division where there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have now awakened in every place of this book, where comes the operation to be performed, which brings about fear and dread.
Why is it necessary for you to be careful with that, and limit it: so that fools do not find an opportunity to speak and defame.
Therefore, take the measure with diligence and protection, help your sick ones easily and firmly, and pray for a better way to lead you by the grace of God to health and praisewein succession: cast away terrible pains difficult to heal, and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and comfort.
For it remains more for your glory, and higher on this earth, and finally to the measures of yours.
For indeed Gallon said that in some of his reminders. One does not cure the evil sickness: do not call me doctor of illnesses.
Now, however, this Treatise has been divided into three Chapters.
Chapter the first.
Of the Cautery with Fire and of the Acute Medicinal Cautery, chapter, and arranged from head to feet, and forms of instruments and tools for Cauterization, and all that is necessary for the Operation.
Chapter second.
Of the Section and Perforation, Phlebotomy and Ventilation, Wounds: and Extraction of Arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, ordered by forms of instruments.
Chapter third.
Of the Restoration and Dislocation, Cure of Torsion, and similar things: chapter, ordered from head to feet, by forms of instruments.
However, before recounting the method of this operation and its injuries, it must be stated about their quality, and how they should be shown regarding constitution.
Therefore, the speech about the quality of Wounding and its injury by Burning is a lengthy, intricate one, with knowledge, and hidden secrets.
Indeed it was discussed among many wise men and they disagreed about that: and for me, it is enough with few words from their speeches, fearing prolixity.
Therefore, I say that Burning is universally suitable for all constitutions that are with matter and without matter; except for two constitutions which are dry constitution without matter and warm constitution without matter.
However, they disagree regarding the constitution that is both warm and dry with matter. Some have said, however, that Burning should be used for this. And others have argued the opposite of that, namely that Burning is not suitable for an illness which is due to warmth and dryness: since by nature fire is warmth; and it does not heal with warmth and dryness from a warm and dry condition.
And he who argues the opposite of that says: that there is an injury with Burning for all warm and dry illnesses which occur in human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its humors to the constitution of fire, you find the body cold.
And indeed I say through his speech: because he has already proven that for me several times.
However, it should not come to pass over this, unless he has already been proven and practiced in the final chapter of the Burning operation, and known the diversity of human constitutions, and disposition of illnesses within them, and their causes, and incidents, and timespan.
However, for the remaining diseases, there is no need to fear them; especially in cold and moist conditions. For indeed all physicians have agreed on these [remedies]: and they did not differ regarding the use of cautery with them.
And know, my sons, that from the secret treatment with cautery and fire, the goodness of it is greater than with burning medicines; for fire is simple, whose action does not extend unless to the member being cauterized: and it harms no other connected member except by a slight injury.
However, the action of burning remedies reaches that which is extended from the member; and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in a part, and perhaps kills.
For fire, due to its subtlenss and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Now this has been revealed to us by experimentation, due to the length of service and study in the art, and proximity to truth: and for that I excuse myself from the length of discourse.
And if it were not because this book of mine does not permit me to bring you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its action in bodies' expulsion by means of a philosophical speech demonstrated to have been remembered by your minds.
And know, my sons, that you yourself disagree on the time when it is suitable to make a cautery, and set a better time with respect to the seasons.
And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time: therefore, because an accidental injury caused by the season is overwhelmed in healing with the camoion, which is attracted to the cautery. Especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent aches that do not tolerate delay: therefore because it fears them as coming of a malignity that is greater than a slight injury remaining untreated due to time.
And that notion should not be held in your minds, my son, which is not acknowledged by the wise and learned physicians, namely that there is never a return from those illnesse that are healed through cauterization; and they argue accordingly, but reality is not as they think: therefore because cauterization is only a place in medicine, which alters complexion, and evaporates the humidities which are causes, hence pains occur.
However, the purpose of cauterization is to enhance the health and effectiveness of its treatment, and the severity of its authority: and it may be possible that an illness returns after some time according to the complexion of the sick person, the location of their illness, and the strength of their body; and what has been prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities therein; and what has arrived at it through its acquisition by foods and similar causes, if no disease is present for cauterization.
A subtle disease in the limb due to a few superfluities and moistures, such as gum elastic on the tooth for pain and similar causes, it is indeed possible that this particular pain does not return therein. But this happens in a few.
However, the speech of the common people again is correct: not what they mean by it in that case: since they believe, that it is a treatment which brings no benefit with medicine, nor any other after dusk from cauterization.
However, the matter is otherwise than that intention, that cauterization being the last of medicine's methods, does not apply when we administer a certain mode of treatment for an illness which those treatments do not confer: then at the end of performing cauterization we provide it, and grants: hence it falls under the category that cauterization is indeed the final step in medicine, not according to the understanding as held by many common people and foolish physicians.
However, the ancients said that a caustic with gold is better than a caustlete with iron; and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that it does not create pus at the site of cauterization. But this is not absolutely so; for I have already tested this, and found that it does not do this on certain bodies without others.
And a caustic with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said. But indeed when you use fire for a caustic with gold, it is not declared to you whether it burns according to the amount which you wish; because of the redness of the gold: and when it hurries towards cold, and if you add heat over it, it melts into fire, and turns into plates.
Why the craftsman falls from that into preoccupation: and because of this, Caustic with iron is quicker and nearer for us, due to its directness in action.
And I have indeed already arranged this Chapter on Caustics according to chapters: and I have arranged those from the head down to the feet, so that seekers may find what they want out of it.
Head II.
Here the cauterization is directed to mastering moisture and cold over the brain: which two causes are of swelling, and an abundance of fluid flows from the head to parts near the eyes and ears, and many dreams, and toothaches, and throat pain: and universally all illnesses that occur due to cold, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, etc., like these diseases.
The mode of cauterization is to advise the sick person: that it be cleansed first with curative medicine purifying the head for three nights or four, as required by the strength of the sick person and his age and habits.
Then instruct him to make his head bald using needles. Next, have him sit between your hands in a square position so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes. And therefore when thy middle finger arrivebeth to the spot, mark it with a heating instrument.
Then an oil-based cauterizer: which is its form.
Then place it over the marked spot and heat it downwards so that your hands are gradually squeezed together, and you remove it slowly. Then quickly move thy hand and look at the place.
Which if you see that now a small quantity of skull has already been revealed or a certain amount of grass seed, then gently move your hand. And if not, repeat thy hand with the same iron or with another of it if it cools down: until you see the bones I told you about.
Then take some from salt and dissolve it in water, drink the mixture yourself, place it on the spot, and let it be for three days.
Then place some of the absorbed substance into butter, leave it on the spot until a burn scar is destroyed by fire. Then treat that with four-drug ointment until healed.
They have said that the more open wound remains, it produces pus; therefore, it is better and promotes healing.
And some of them have said that it should be cauterized to the bone; and keep the oil-based cauterizer until a certain density of bone is burnt.
Then scrape after what has been burnt from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it should reach with the cauterizer to the very end until it imprints on the bone, so that the bone falls off as if shaped by a carving tool: or an instrument that women place in infused alphabets: and they think, that from this spot wafts out breath of the head, and let the open sore be abandoned for a long time.
Then it is treated until it consolidates.
However, to me these two types of cautery are not at all visible except in certain people according to the channel of fear.
And let it be removed; for its own sake, it is better with me.
For the head indeed is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head sickly is naturally weak: and the first type of cautery, I find it healthier and better, and use it: therefore operating with it for health.
Head III.
When pain occurs throughout the whole head in a chronic manner: and it is prolonged by those who are sick, and used by physicians, women, purifiers of heads, oils, and emollients. (Note that "empleumatis" seems to be an error or corruption; without context or further information from the original text, providing a correction is challenging.) And especially if it has already been cauterized with one type of catury, which we have mentioned, and does not gain anything from those (remedies/practices); then consider the following. (Note that "then consider" is an interpretation; the Latin term may require a more context-specific phrase depending on what follows in the text.) For if the head of a sickly person is strong by nature and not weak, and finds intense coldness: then you should cauterize with another type of cautery underne. (Note that "under" seems to be an incorrect interpretation; without further context from the original text it's unclear what "sub illo parum" means.) Then you should cauterize it with a cautery over all its own horns of the head, lest the skin be not pierced and a quantity is revealed from within by bone, which we have spoken about. (Note that without context this translation may require adjustments to match specific surgical practices referenced in Albucasis' work.) And you should cauterize it with one type of cautery on its own occipital part of the head, at a place called the wardrobe: and it is a location where one sets their winds; be gentle therein (and do not reveal bone). Indeed, he found himself weakened because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
And I will say this about the Cautery in its place: it is a cautery that should be used to cauterize the skullal horns and the back of the head more delicately with another cautery, which is applied to the middle part of the head.
Head IV.
When pain and swelling occur in the head or it extends up to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and further treatment as I have said in divisions of illnesses is administered, but does not resolve everything completely: then cauterization should be performed on that area in two ways: either with burning medicine or with iron.
However, the cautery with burning medicine is to take one of its teeth and remove it along with the core, and split off the extremities from both sides. Then, cut out the painful place with a broad fleam until it becomes under the skin at a spot where fat is found.
Therefore, insert it into that under the skin until it is hidden: then bind a suitable constrictor tightly over it with a linen strip, and leave it for fifteen hours; afterward extract it entirely and let blood freely flow out of it for two or three days; afterwards place butter submersed in cotton above it to make the wound produce pus: then heal it by rubbing with ointment until cured.
And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise, concerning those which burn.
However, its cauterization with iron is done in this manner. The fire of the causticum whose shape is thus.
And it's called "clay" (also known as cupping): because its form is like that of a clay vessel, which contains something related to burning or charring, and there is a small prominence in the middle of it.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and slowly move the iron with ease; and let the quantity that is to be burned be equal to the thickness of the skin. And elevate your hand so as not to burn the underlying artery and let blood flow occur.
Then soak the cauterium in salted water and place it on the spot for three days; then put a cauterium with butter: afterward, heal it with ointment until it is completely healed.
And if you wish, treat this hemicrany using the second sharp edge of the cauterium tool. And avoid making an incision on the artery for this hemiccuhy.
In such a manner of treating hemicraies with old methods.
When treating a hemicrany with what we have mentioned in the previous treatment and what we have mentioned about disease divisions, and if there is no immediate healing: and you see from the illness that what has been said before regarding first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire does not suffice for it; then let the burns be made with the blade of a scalpel till pus forms after having placed signs of pain on the spot in lines whose length is half a finger long, or almost that: and hold your hand over one place until you make an incision into the artery and come near to the mouth.
However, it is necessary for you to cauterize the continuation of the jawbone that moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve which moves it, from where a spasm occurs.
And this is done over the foreskin, and precautions regarding the flow of blood from the severed artery. However, the fear is about that incision, especially for him who does not know what he does and is neither diligent nor experienced: and abandons the surgery with him firstly.
And I come with a recollection of the management of blood flow accidents from an artery according to its nature, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that this Cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man enduring the Cajoile on his head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you see, apply the Cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter of extracting an artery with a Cajoile having two knives. For this kind of Cautery is better and more beneficial.
On the method of applying a Cajoile for an earache.
When an earache happens from the cold and is healed with poultices and the remaining treatment as we have mentioned in division, and if it does not remove pain then use a fire Cajoile; and this is called the Point which has this form: [Image of Punctum] (Note that this text implies an image should follow. As this could be historical or archaeological representation of the technique, here we represent it with "[Image of Punctum]" for completeness in translation).
Then after its use of the Point around the entire ear as it moves: or around both ears if there is pain in both at the same time. And stretch with the Cajoile from the root of the ear just enough after you have marked places with Encausto (beeswax): and the quantity of the Point should be ten throughout the entire ear, as above.
Then care for the spots until they heal.
On the method of applying a Cajoile for torture [or] painful earache: (Note that this instruction may be referring to two potential context
Chapter veintisiete.
The torture that is treated with cauterization does not differ except for those that arise from humors, as we have explained in the division of diseases.
And regarding a specific type of cauterization, which occurs due to dryness and nerve spasm.
When healing this type of torture with hot baths, purgatives, and gargles does not provide your cure, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick person three times: one at the root of the ear, a second lower but near to its tympanum, and a third at the junction of both lips.
And place your caster on the opposite side of the weak area. For soothing does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is to apply it with your caster on the skin directly under the upper end of the ear, slightly below a bit; and another at its tympanum: whose length shall be according to the width of the finger. And place your hand with the caster until it burns off half the thickness of the skin.
And this is the form of the caster and it is a kind from a knife, whose shape has been given beforehand; however, it is not so fine as you can see: and it should be that there is excess thickness little in the knife.
Then care for the places with what has preceded; until it heals.
Regarding the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
When ancient apoplexy is being treated, and the methods we have mentioned do not provide your healing, and the sick person does not have a fever, then you should cauterize him with four casters over all corners of his head, and with a caster in the middle as we have said, and a caster on the occipital part, just like what has preceded; and the form of the caster will be according to that which preceded.
"Also, it is cauterized with a cautery on the upper jaw bone: and it is even more extreme.
Then healed by that which preceded it.
Head IX.
"It is necessary that the large bowel be first affected by a cleansing pill to purify the brain.
"Then thoroughly cleanse the head of a sick person and place on top of his occiput an ointment as described in the treatise of plasters, and apply it several times.
"For that is a method of cutting: and do thus in the same order as I have mentioned here.
"If therefore healed by this, it is good. "If not: then give him three cuts on the back of his head, from the upper part down to below the eye, and place between every cut a thickness of a finger.
Then heal with cautery as was done before.
"If however you want to add, and the sick person can bear it: then give him a cut on top. "If however you want to add: then cauterize it above the two horns.
"Then heal as long until healed; and do a second cut according to the shape that has been mentioned before.
"In the method of cutting for paralysis, and softening.
Head X.
"It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head for bowels and that which we have mentioned.
"Then thoroughly cleanse the head of a sick person: afterwards cut with a hot iron on top of his head, and on all sides of his skull cap, and behind it, and three times over the vertebrae of his neck.
"If however you find weakness in the softening of many parts of his body, and he can bear it, and the illness is strong: then cut with four hot irons over the vertebrae of his back, and lastly until it burns deeply into its skin, and soothes your hand. Then take care of it until it heals; and thus apply an olive oil poultice.
Thus, regarding the method of cauterization for epilepsam.
The head not be cauterized for epilepsy unless it is that of the one whose epilepsy comes from phlegm.
Therefore, it must be purified that brain of his first with salt and the rest cure which we discussed in division: when sick is great or endures in receiving drugs.
But if it is a boy who does not endure drugs, then he will be given gargling, and chewing purifying the brain, before many days with nourishment of foods.
Then shave his head afterwards, and then cauterize him with one Cautery at the middle of the head as it preceded in method: and with another Cautery at its occipital, and over all horns of the head with a Cautery. That if sick has been strong and endured, then cauterize him with the Cauteries which I said in having paralysis, and softening of body over the spines of the neck, and spines of back: and let it be Olive Cautery according to method that preceded.
But if sick is a boy then place the Cautery delicately according to this method.
Thus, regarding the method of cauterization for melancholia.
When the cause of melancholy are putrefying humors and thickened phlegm then cauterize him with the Cauteries which we said in having paralphasia.
And if the cause of melancholy is overflowing of declining humors to melancholy, and sick body moistened, then give him in drink that purifies his brain as it preceded in division: afterwards shave head of sick, and make thereafter a well-made hoop from linen like circle.
Then place it on the middle of the head, and the patient sitting is to be held from all sides.
Then apply the ointment. And it is more superior than the old butter emulsion. And heat it with a measure of heated iron that can be held by the finger when introduced into it. Then wash it in the middle of its head in a circle and let go until it cools down.
Make this for the sick person once every week, together with his other good treatment, until cured.
Or if blood is present, burn it by making many small points of it, while holding the hand with the cauterizing iron: let it be foul-smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain in a certain way.
Then place it on an absorbed cloth soaked in butter or goose fat.
§ From the method of cauterizing using descending water near the eye.
Head XIV.
When it is said to you that the beginning of water in the eye by means of signs which I mentioned earlier, then start and give drinks to the sick person with what cleanses his head.
And protect it from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath on fasting days for several days.
Then order that he shave his head, and burn it on the middle of his own head. Then burn it with two pieces of iron on two cauteries, if there is an incision for water in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if there is an incision in one eye: and separate with the cautery all veins and arterries that are under the skin: and let the burns be long in width equal to the pieces of iron: and stop any bleeding.
But if you see anything coming from it, then immediately separate with any possible medicine: and I will come with the wisdom that is in extracting arteries, and separating them, and precautions against bleeding.
And at times it is cauterized within the cheeks, under two bones, with two cauteries finally produced.
By this method of cauterizing in ancient tears.
When tears of the eyes are ancient and persistent: they are above the veins, and the arteries that lie on the exterior surface of the prominent head; it is ascertained that this is due to excesses of coldness, phlegmatic nature; then by cauterization with a caustic instrument in the manner described for stopping descending water (in the chapter of nose bleeding), with a caustic instrument at the center of the head and with two caustics over each temple, and two caustics within the cheeks under two bones. And if there is a need for additional treatment, then it is cauterized on all sides of the eye carefully with a small caustic instrument at the outer edge of the eyebrow.
By this method of cauterizing in the smell of the nose.
When you treat this with what we have said about division and it does not provide relief; then hasten the treatment, and give three boiled cock's nuts in a drink: afterwards shave that person've head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized caustic instrument along with an olive oil caustic. Then by cauterization it is done with a caustic instrument and two small caustics over each eyebrow under the hairs slightly.
And guard against cutting this artery, lest you injure it.
And this is the method of cauterization for the eyebrow.
By this method of cauterizing for softening eyelids.
When the eyelids are softened by disease or moisture; then the eyelids are cauterized with one caustic instrument and this moon-shaped caustic instrument.
And if flesh is found, burn it above two eyebrows with a few pieces of burning metal on all sides; and they should be lengthened from two temples: and the entire length of the burner shall correspond to the lengths of the eyebrows; and do not finish your hand along with the burner, but according to the amount that has been charred, three-quarters of the upper eyelid.
Regarding the manner of burning the eyelid with pointed hairs, they are directed towards the eye.
The burner is of two types: either a burner with fire, or a burner with burning medicine.
For the burner with fire, instruct the patient to remove their hairs beforehand if they are among those who cleanse them; until they grow out and become even. If they prick him near his own origin: then tighten their eyes with wet cloths so that they do not move until they heal.
When they have healed and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap; next mark over the eyelids of their eyes with encaustic paint, a mark that corresponds to the shape of myrtle leaves: and let the beginning of the mark be near their hairs.
Then place a soaked cotyledon on parchment paper or mucilage of Psyllium over the eye.
Then with the burner fire, whose shape is as follows. (Note: The description of the burner's shape would be expected to follow in a full translation
Then burn over the shape you marked gradually in many places until the skin surface is charred, which is like the entire visible face of a myrtle leaf.
And the sign of the success of your work is: if you see that the eyelid of the eye has started to contract, and hairs grow at the point near the eye.
Therefore cleanse your hand and then release it for three days.
Then place a piece of cotton soaked in oil on the wound until the scab is removed. Then care for it with ointment until healed.
And if a few hairs emerge after the hour, and soothe the eyelid; then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
But if hairs are on the lower part: then burn that area with cautery until it returns to its natural place; and smooth so as not to prickle the eyes with hairs.
You are instructed to advise the patient that he should let hairs grow out and become even. Make a leaf-like shape from linen cloth.
Then take a piece from known soap and one unweighed ounce of not soaked lime, then mix them with good pressure at once, that it does not become cold. Then spread out the resulting paste on a cloth made like the leaf shape you created earlier, and place it over one or two eyelids. And put under the eye soaked cotton on an egg white, and let the patient's head rest in your lap.
And place your index finger over the medicine and press lightly. And you move it whenever the patient feels a sting from the medicine, as if it were fire.
While he continues with this which he finds a sting of the medicine, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger. Whenever the sting subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid being smoothed out, as it would be with heat or cutting, it is well: and if not, repeat over the same area from the medicine on the spot where the medicine was not impressed, but without darkening until your work is done, and the eye contracts.
Then place it on top of the lump with ointment until the burnt skin is removed. Then take care of it with diaphanous or other oil until healed.
And it is necessary for you during the surgery to act as the final safeguard so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid is softened after a day and something from the hairs enters the eye, then apply the medicine repeatedly to that place which was softened by the eyelid itself, as you did initially. Then take care of it until healed.
And this is the form of the leaf of myrtle.
And you know that human eyes vary greatly in size and thickness. Therefore, here is your consideration: and the straight path should not be hidden from him who has a desire for this art.
§ On how to perform cauterization on the tear duct fistula.
When you treat the fistula as we have mentioned in section on diseases of divisions and your care does not provide relief: then it is necessary that you perform a cauterization according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head with a hand of yours so that it does not move or shake along with its own neck.
Then place a soaked lump on the bulge of his eye or in psyllium mucilage over his eye: then apply cauterization fire whose form is as follows.
It is a shallow depression as the form of a reed feather from one end, with which cauterization is made: and if the heat be penetrating to the other end, then try it in that direction too.
However, this depression is better for your purpose.
Then express the [anal] fistula if it is open and extract from it a healthy vessel, and remove the matter itself: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract the pus within.
Then place some cautery on it afterwards, which is very much burned.
And hold your hand a little above the cautery from eye to nose so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: and place the catury on fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you come at the beginning of your cautery to the mouth, it will be well done. And if not: then apply the cautery once more or twice as you find necessary: and let go of that for three days.
Then place a cotton with butter, and care for it with an ointment that cleanses, until healed.
But if after forty days it is not healed: then place a strong and corrosive medicine on that, until the bone appears: and cleanse it according to what came out in its chapter.
And there is another method of cautery for [anal] fistulas that some of the first ones said. Direct your attention to the place of the fistula and find it: then place a fine camahan (a type of cautery) in that fissure, which is a delicate tube, whose shape is as follows. And pour into it a certain amount of molten lead, and hold your hand with the retaining tube properly, and do not move at all, so that he does not run or come to his eye with the liquid lead.
And it is necessary that you place some cotton soaked in lime water or water on his eye.
For lead burns the place of the f [anal] fistula and heals it with a wonderful healing.
What if a fistula is healed with what we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening and reduce the fistula along the course of the nose, according to where it comes into its own right place.
§ On the manner of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Often there occur in the fissures of lips, which are called warts, and especially on children's lips.
When you treat these fwartches as we have said about the division of the illness and if it does not provide healing, then with a small grinding knife burned in fire according to this manner.
And let it be made shallow according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place that burned thing quickly into the very fissures until the cautery reaches deep into the fissures.
Then care for it with a dressing until healed.
§ On the manner of cauterizing in oral fistulas.
When there is an abscess at the base of a gum or on the palate or at the roots of teeth: then it makes pus and bursts: afterwards it is opened and pus flows, and becomes a fistula: then treat that one, and if it does not provide healing, then it is necessary for cautery fire to take according to the amount which enters in the fistula. Then insert that burned thing into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand, until the burning iron arrives deep within it, and its end: do this once or twice.
Then care for that after that, with what we have said about treatment up to when it is healed.
If however the discharge separates and heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to how it comes into its head.
By this means cauterizing on gums and softened teeth.
When the gums are softened due to moisture, and moving teeth with medicine is not effective: then place the sick head on your lap.
Then the cauterizing iron, whose form comes after these things, so that you place a cannula over the tooth: and insert the glowing cautery quickly into it: and hold your hand slightly, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already come to the root of the tooth.
And moisten your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times as you see fit.
Then the sick person fills his own mouth with salt water and holds it for one hour: and spits it out.
For indeed the tooth is made firmer by movement, and softened gums are tightened, and dried moisture of decayed tissue.
By this means cauterizing on dental pain.
When dental pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness on it, or blueness, and healing with medicines does not occur: then the cautery on that is according to two methods: either a cautery with butter, or a cantharides plaster.
The cautery with butter is, as you take the clarified butter warm, and pour it into a copper cup or vessel. Then take pitch, and anoint it over the extremity of the thread. Then immerse the item in boiled butter and place the item quickly over the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools down: then repeat the process a few times as long as the heat of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if there is a toothache, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth; then put heated iron upon it, until the heat of the fire reaches deep into the hollows of the tooth.
The cauterization with fire is as if you were aiming at a tube of air or iron pipe. And there should be something of swelling in the body, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Then put heated iron for cauterization onto it: and place your hand on it until the iron is cooled down.
Do that several times, because pain will be relieved, or on the same day, or another day.
And it is necessary for that impression of the cauterization to fill up the sick person's mouth with good balm and hold it for an hour: then spit out the substance.
This is the form of ccuetarization.
Cauterize with whatever extremity of a tooth as it is possible: and this is the form of cunnulation.
§ On how to perform cauterization on a stye.
When styes are from phlegm and cold moisture, and they do not obey the treatment by means of medicaments quickly; then apply a hollow heated iron for cauterization, whose shape is this.
Having two openings to let the smoke from the cautery come out by one of them; and place it heated once over the boil, and a second time if you deem fit, until the heat reaches deep into the boils.
If the boil is large: then place the cautery according to the quantity of boils.
Then remove it after three days, and place a wool soaked in butter over it until the thing that was burned away by fire is healed.
Then care for it with tooth ointment until the tube heals.
Thus, by burning a cautery on the larynx lesion and restricting breathing.
When pains overcome moistures of the windpipe, especially when it is with chills of a complexion, then one must first be eased by liquified medicines.
Then burn it with a hot iron near the root of the thyroid at a lowered place; and be careful not to approach with the cautery towards the throat, nor into the skin, unless necessary for that purpose.
Then burn it with another cautery at the joint of the neck on its last vertebrae's final part; and let the cautery be blunt as was previously used.
Then care for it with what was previously used until healed.
Thus, by the method of burning a cut on diseases of the lungs and Tussis (cough).
When the cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has no fever or phthisis (tuberculosis), and old illness: then burn it with two cauteries above the furrow in places that are lowered, mild, and slight. And with another cautery on the middle of the chest between two nipples; and let the cautery be a tube as was previously used.
And if you wish to be burned with a pricking using the cautery called 'Punctum', whose form previously succeeded in earache pricking: and let there be pricks from thirty up to nearly as many others.
Then care for it with what was previously used until healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: as per this form. Therefore, let it be lanced with that cauterization when you do so with one and three cauteries.
Chapter 2cuate XVII.
When the head is dislocated due to humidity and does not return within its own hour, until it has become customary for its reduction, then it should be dislodged by a slight movement, as we have already testified that such an event occurs, one must first reduce the dislocation. Then the patient is laid down on their back or on the healthy side. Then clean a ligament that is inside of Titillicus towards the upper part with fingers of your left hand: and if there is a dislocation to the inner side.
Then, holding cautery fire with two sticks. (Note: This appears to be an incomplete sentence.) What is this form?
Then cauterize the ligament until it penetrates to another side and comes out in the shape of a cauterization with four cauteries. (Note: This also appears incomplete without context on what is being referred.)
And sometimes a cauterization is done with three sticks in the cautery, that's why it has the shape of six cauteries then: and the sticks are according to the subtlety tried. (Note: This sentence also seems incomplete and lacks context for complete understanding.)
And this is the form of a cautery having three sticks. (Note: Lacks clinical or procedural context but translates directly from the provided Latin text fragment).
And sometimes an additional method is added to this form, that's why there are eight cauteries. (Note: Contextual understanding necessary for complete comprehension.)
Then place over the cautery a slice of fat with salt. (Note: Lacks further instructions or context, but is translated directly from Latin to English). Then let the patient stick to calmness so that they do not move their limb for a while until it is comforted. (Note: The original Latin text could use more context for better understanding of procedure).
And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a heated iron or by making multiple punctures with cauteries.
And the joint is fastened, and excess moisture is removed; then the sick man is healed.
§ On the method of cauterizing a stomach.
When these happen in the stomach of cold and many humors, until they extract themselves from their own constitution, and much catarrh is added to it, and consistent care methods are applied, but do not succeed: then one must ensure that the sick person lies on his back, extends his legs, and spreads out his hands. Then one must cauterize with three cauteries: the first being as large as a finger, located under the spoon-shaped part of the chest equal to that size and using a hot iron; and two more smaller ones on either side of the larger cautery, until the figure of the triangular cauteries is achieved. And lengthen between them so that they do not join together when producing pus.
And the depth of the cautery should be equal to twice one-third of the thickness of the skin.
And the figure of the casteries should be as described, without any addition; and if you wish to apply a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: then the single cautery that is created by this method should have the shape of a circle as indicated.
And the stomach is to be punctured by you who are troubled by this cautery; and it should have signs on the stomach in proportion to what you apply with encaustic (beeswax); then one must cauterize it with a point cautery: after that, take care of it with treatment that preceded until it is healed.
The method of applying a cold caustic to Epar.
Chapter 9a. When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and moisture, or because of heavy winds, until it leaves its natural excessive discharge from the body, and when the patient is being treated with what we said, and does not improve; then one should lay the patient on his back over his own neck: apply three cauterizations according to this figure in quantity equal above Epar below hypocundres, where it reaches the length of a man's cubitus. There should be space between each cautery corresponding to its thickness: and the cautery itself should be as long as the straight line of the body: do not press too much with your hand on the cauterio.
And let the quantity used for burning be according to the thickness of the skin, half that amount not added: and let the patient stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then lying down with legs extended, and arms lifted away.
This is the form of the cauterization.
And it is possible for you to apply this cauterization with a surgeon's knife when there is subtlety and skill in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too far in the cauterization so that it burns through the entire thickness of the skin, and thus affects the whole body, reaching the intestines; for there the skin is delicate, you know this well.
The method of applying a cauterization to apostemas in the liver.
When it is a bleeding ulcer and you know the wound to be on the flesh of the liver or its coat: then if on the flesh of the link, there will be painful heaviness without sharpness; but if on its coat, there is acute pain with swelling: and you see that it has exhausted its physicians' treatment.
Therefore, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their own back. Then he makes room for the adhesions with a wax figure; then the burning iron, resembling a wand. And this is its form. And he cauterizes with that same cautery one spot until the entire skin is burned away, and reaches the sinew, until all pus is expelled; then he proceeds to treat the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
And it should not be used with the same kind of cautery, unless whose dedication to the art of medicine extends: and such diseases are drawn by whose hand through experiment on several occasions; then indeed he may dare this kind of procedure.
However, it is better to remove it, in my opinion.
¶ Of the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
The ancients said that with the root of the Aristolochia plant and a wax figure, they treated pleurisy in this way. And it is as if you receive from the dried roots of Aristolochia, a single root longer than that found therefrom, and let its size be like the bulk of a finger. Then immerse it into oil; and burn it up with fire. Then you cauterize with one cautery on that which is between the continuous ridge and neck, and with two equal-sized caucetries slightly lowered towards the side below the beard.
And with two other cautery on that which is between the 5th and 6th ridge near to the back slightly: and with another cautery at the center of the chest, and yet another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from behind: one on that which is between the two blades; and with two cauterys at both sides of the chest, lower than the cautery between the blades.
And it is not necessary to press your hand with a caustic, for indeed, let it be foul-smelling in the skin.
And now some old men have said that there are people who use a caustic made of iron similar to the radius bone; and they heat it up, and place it inside between the ribs until it reaches the ulcer, from which pus comes out: as we discussed in the case of an appendage on the liver.
But in this puncture with a causteen there is fear because either the sick person dies immediately, or it happens at a site of abscess for which there is no healing.
§ On the method of incinerating in Book 32: The Spleen Head.
When you are treating the pain of the spleen as we have mentioned from healing by division of diseases, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then the caustic is used in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of them is to make three caustics by drawing lines according to the length and shape of the spleen in accordance with the figure of the caustics for the liver that precedes it.
And let there be a quantity of thickness to every caustic that is equal to or less than one finger's breadth.
And the method of the caustic should be as we have said for the liver, evenly.
And do not press your hand with a caustic: and let the sick person lie on their back over their own back.
Another method of cauterization is as follows: having two tongs for the caustic as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and oiling the skin that is directly over the spleen, where the sick person's left elbow reaches: and your ointment application should be as you remove the skin according to the width of the body, so that the caustics fall along the length of the body.
Then insert two hot wires deeply until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then remove the cautery. Therefore, four cauterizations are made.
And if you want to cauterize with another cautery having three wires.
Then care for the cautery after letting it emit pus for many days, as it is more concentrating than what remained from previous treatments.
¶ Of the method of cauterization in hydroposis. (Note: "Hydropisis" seems to be a misspelling and should likely
The cautery does not fall into hydroposis unless specially prescribed. (Note: "ascliti" and "Hydropisis" are likely Latinized terms or typos, with the former possibly referring
When you treat hydroposis with the methods we have mentioned in division and it does not improve, then one must perform four cauterizations around the navel, with a single cautery over the stomach, another over the liver (epar), one over the spleen, two after the back between the vertebrae, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin. (Note: "Hydropicum" appears to be a misspelling or typo, possibly referring to hydropsy or hydroposis.)
Then let an open cautery emit pus over a long period of time. (Note: "dimitere" and "cauterium apertum" suggest the release or letting go of an opened wound to allow it
And do not leave the weakened one after cautery with it: what is needed is that two intentions should be brought to him; so he will hasten towards his own healing with God's help. (Note: The text includes terms and phrases such as "euacues infirmum," which may need context-specific interpretation or corrections.)
The form of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a wick; according to the precedent shape: and that with which the back is cauterized should be made like oil, according to what preceded its shape. (Note: Latin medical terminology requires specific knowledge to interpret phrases such as "clauelis" and "oliuaris," suggesting a particular form or type of wick.)
§ On the method of cauterizing feet and shanks.
Chapter 34. When there is a discharge in dropsy and they are filled with yellow fluid: it should be cauterized on the back of the foot, between the earlobe and the ring finger: gently heat with your hand holding a caustic; do not twist it at all. Then warm your hand again: and do not roll it over anything at all.
For indeed the yellow fluid seeps out, and the caustic should be applied as per this method.
Then make two caustics on each shank, and let the cutting edge of the caustic be made: and let another caustic be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower, approximately at mid-thigh; and also place two caustics over all the thighs: and discard the open caustic without delaying for a long period so that some fluid may seep out from it: then treat it with the remaining things as I mentioned.
§ On the method of cauterizing on the chest area.
Chapter 지.
Chapter 35. When there is a discharge from the chest due to coldness and dampness, until it has weakened its retaining and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: treat this with healing methods, but not cauterization; and if you see that it can tolerate an abundant caustic, then cauterize it on a large caustic over its own stomach, as preceded by cauterizing the stomach with a circular caustic, and four subtle caustics in a circle below the navel with a fine caustic; and also with a large caustic over the hollow of the arm, or two caustics.
And if you see abundant dampness and it being tolerated by the weakened one, then cauterize with a caustic over the chest, and another caustic over the entire side: and perhaps add two small caustics on the stomach near large ones.
Therefore, it is a successful treatment whose purpose does not err.
On how to cauterize hemorrhoids.
Chapter 36.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold, or corrupt fluids, then they heal by the method we mentioned for division, but not with a cauterization: then use three cauldrons on the lower spine of the back just undernelevated somewhat triangularly, and with a cauterizing iron under the navel as if with two fingers.
And if you think that its stomach is cold and its food is not digested, and its face appears to be covered with pustules, then use the cauldrons over its stomabg on a large cauldron according to what preceded: and also with a caudrone above its liver, and another one above its spleen using a closed caudrone: and remove the caudrone open after some time; then treat it until healed.
Chapter 3e.
When you cut off the alathels, then use fires of caution that resemble rays. Then insert the burning item into the cut-off alathel: and use your last hand until it reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If then there are many alathels, then use a cauldron on each one according to what we described. Then treat them with the method they deserve using ointments until healed.
And if you use a large cauldron on it over the pouch, it is more of an extreme measure for its treatment.
On how to cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not obey the instructions of surgery and operations as we described before, perhaps they are healed with a caustic agent.
When it happens to someone that has an abscess and is old, there flows pus from it, and the decayed fluids. Thus, what is fitting for him is to probe it with a delicate instrument. Then ascertain the depth of it with a measuring rod.
Then apply caustic iron, which is similar to an antenna. Then introduce yourself into the fistula with a heated instrument and measure how much you insert.
And repeat the caustic application on it until all decayed tissues are burned away, once or twice or thrice, according to your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves if they are there or large wounds; and if the faster flows into the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then guard against all these places.
And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fatty area; and think that it does not pass through (the tissues).
Then care for it until it heals up to some extent.
But if the place is sealed off and separated from it (the fistula), and remains for a longer time: then know that it has been healed completely.
But if it is not separated from (the fistula), then know that it is piercing through (the tissues) or that there is a dead bone within it, or as though it came from those: and recall this explanation at the place.
Regarding the method of causticizing kidneys.
When it happens that there is pain in the kidneys from cold or from severe winds, and as a result of this the patient's urine diminishes, then one must apply caustic iron over the almethene on top of those kidneeby heated instrument on the entire kidney with a caustic rod, whose quantity has been recalled.
And perhaps we shall cauterize it a second time at the same location. Why do they come in threes? Therefore, there will be even more in lamentation.
§ On the manner of cauterizing the Bladder.
When there is a weak bladebladder and the mollification by coldness and moisture until it can no longer hold ineffective urine, then one should perform cautery on the lower part of the summit above the bladder where the piles begin to branch out. Use cautery from the right side of the summit and another from the left. The length of this second cauterization shall be according to the number of finger joints. Then, perform cautery on the lower back with a single caustic or two if necessary. The duration should correspond to how quickly the caustic took effect previously.
§ On the manner of cauterizing the Uterus.
When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, and it is prevented from pregnancy, and its menstruations are corrupted, and delayed is the stimulation of those things, and pain happens to her near their onset, then one should perform cautery with three caustics around the umbilicus as we discussed in urethral cauterization. Use a single caustic over the lower back or two if necessary. The duration should correspond to how quickly the caustic took effect previously.
§ On the manner of performing cauterization on the ankle during a dislocation.
When there is an outpouring of mucosal moisture towards the pouches of the ankle, and it leads to his departure from its place: and a sign of this is that he lengthens his leg above another when he leans on one knee; then it has been discovered that the location of dislocation is in an empty space there.
Therefore, it is necessary to apply a caustic over the flaccid spot on Ancha's own cauterizing instrument, similar to a circle: after you mark with hot wax along the circumference of the spot, as if it were rolling back: and let it fall into the center of the circle.
But if you do not have this caustamo at hand, then cauterize it with three caustics, using a large oil burner: and let the depth of the caustic be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole area.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
By this method of treating Sciatica.
When pain occurs on Ancha's flaccid spot, and the cause is coldness and moisture: and treat the afflicted as we have said in division, and it does not provide a cure, and let it be outdated: then you should dissolve the infirmity with fluids from a gross substance with foul pills or artificial ones, and similar. Then cauterize it.
And the method of caustication there is by two methods: or with a caustic bringing forth medicine, or with fire.
A caustic with fire is in many ways.
One of which is to apply a caustic over Ancha's own flaccid spot with three triangular caustics in this shape. And make them either good or bad depth. And the space that is between all caustics of thickness with a finger's breadth: and let it be an oil burner caustic.
Sometimes however, the caustic happens in the middle over Ancha's own head. Therefore there are four caustics.
And if a vein is burned with a circle, which precedes the shape of cauterization for dislocations of joints, one: that the circle encompannoans the entire ankle.
And it heats up the thickness of the whole skin.
This is a method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain clings to the same ankle and does not spread up to the hip and leg.
But if it extends to the hip and leg, then you burn that place with two cauteries over the hip, on the place towards which it leans weakly, where there is pain, and your caustic circle four fingers above a little part of the shin: and let the caustic be circular.
And let the depth of the caustic correspond to the thickness of the skin.
And if it leans weakly that the pain extends near to the toes, then you burn there where it bends with a caustic of points, three or four or more if needed so.
And if it leans weakly that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then you burn there with a circular caustic.
And caution yourself in all your burnings, that you do not end with a caustic at this point to cauterize the nerves or a great artery, and draw through it over the bad weakness of ill nature, or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one and another of them who burned above the shin, and ended with cauterization, and inflamed is the leg until a swelling came up to the foot, and pierced was all of it, and rotten was the whole foot: then happened discharge from the winds, and death after that.
That if the pain is in two places at once, burn each one according to this method.
And certain wise ones have said about cauterizing the ankle, which is this method of cauterization. Create a facsimile of a candle from iron, whose diameter is half the width of your palm; and let it be at the opening according to the size of the fingernail bulb, or lesser so: and within that wax should be third wax.
And let there be space that is between all waxes according to the number of knots on a finger; and they should have openings at both ends; and their height like knots, or two knots: and make them handles properly shaped from iron attached to the wicks.
Then it should be burned in fire until reddening, and cast sparks: then placed over a poultice on the weak ankle lying on its side with the healthy leg raised. Therefore, it should be cauterized with three round cauterizations in one place.
Then let it rest for three days. Afterward, apply plasters with butter: and leave the open wound uncovered for many days. Then care for it with ointment until healed.
Says Albukhari, in this species of cauterization with a son's hair, we have been little used, because of the frightening appearance of it; and therefore, since few are found who anticipate on top of it.
But nevertheless, from good cauterizations is that one who suffers it, and has been found at the same place with it.
But the cauterium when drugs are coming, as you will make two waxes having a perforated ring, into which descends the ligament of its gate from iron or bronze, length equal to a wall: whose heights should be like two knots, or themselves.
And let there be space that is between both the size of a finger's thickness, and they should have openings below and above; and what contains them within an inch according to this form.
Then place it over a lead plate (or pot), with the injured lying on the healthy side. And press your hand firmly upon the lead plate for a long time. Then pour an amount equivalent to one hour's time between two circles of warm water that has been heated with a fire just enough, and let the sick person endure its scalding and burning sensations; for indeed it was found that the scalding is like fire until rest comes.
Then moisten your hand with an implement and wash the lead plate thoroughly with warm water mixed with sweet water; then let it rest for three days.
And place over that butter until the blackness of burns disappears; then let it rest for some days and from it will run out pus. For indeed it is the last thing to use.
Then care for that with ointments until healed.
But if pain extends up to the hip or leg: make him lie down in such that contains water as you did on the lead plate evenly.
And this is a way of using warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the remedies for healing. Take alkaline substances and unburned ashes of both sides: grate each separately, and place them in a new pot whose bottom part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that will be added for heating up: and place another glass vessel underne.then pour over alkaline substances and ashes from sweet water so that it covers both by one finger: after which you press these things with your hand through good compression: then remove the pot until the sharp water descends from the bottom part of the glass vase.
Then add all that water and pour it over another piece of ash: and mix them until they dissolve again.
Indeed, it will then be very strong and sharp for use in many surgical operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs. Since it performs its action by fire itself.
And among the drugs, with which hare's ears are burned like cauterization, and honey, and almond milk, so that each is mixed together. ¶
And indeed, Galen has reported, from the treatment of a man from ancient times for pain in the hare'n and sciatic nerve: and he greatly praised its efficacy. ¶ And he said that no other treatment was needed and because it was healed by one means until it revealed, perhaps the patient himself had entered a bath previously and was cured from it already. ¶
And it is to be received from the seeds of the green myrobalan: and if not found green, then take dried; and mix thoroughly with some butter; and apply generously over the hare's ear, where there is pain or leg or hip; and bind it, and leave for a period of three hours, or by how much time as feels weakness from burning. ¶ Then introduce him into a bath. ¶
Thus when his body becomes sweaty, introduce it to a chair. ¶ For the pain subsides and heals. ¶
And you know that it should not be used with any cauterization except after evacuating the body. ¶
And Dioscoreia who said that the dung of goats, when used with such a cauterization for the sciatic nerve, is beneficial; and it makes a cauterization in this manner. ¶ Take wool and moisten with ancient oil, and place it over a deep spot that is between the first joint of the foot and second, and near to a coal. ¶
Then take dry goat dung and set it on fire until it turns into charcoeburned
Then place the substance over the wool and blow off the flames until they are extinguished. Then repeat that process. Therefore do not cease doing this until you feel relief from pain through its use and the pain subsides.
And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinum caustic.
> Of the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain occurs on the back from many causes such as an accident, a blow, excessive evacuation, and similar conditions; due to the injection of cold material: but this cauterization does not apply except in this kind alone that results from the injection of cold material. (This appears to be Chapter 42 or section reference from a medieval Latin text discussing specific cases where a certain method of treatment applies.)
Therefore, after evacuation of the sick with foul pills and similar substances, let these be made on the back where there is pain in three lines according to its width; when signs are marked by encaustic along each line five cauterizations or more depending upon the quantity that comes from the patient's tolerable strength: and let the caustization be done with cauderiopuncture. (This appears to continue discussing treatment instructions regarding specific conditions, detailing how a particular procedure involving encaustic marks should be applied.)
And if you will, cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a middle-type caustic tool according to this shape. (This sentence provides guidance on how many times and with what kind of tool the cauterization should be performed.)
> Of the manner of performing caustics in cases of Hunchback (Gibbositas). (This suggests a heading or introduction to instructions on treating hunchback conditions with caustic procedures.)
Often, this condition occurs in young children. (This sentence could be the beginning of a discussion about commonality and demographic prevalence.)
The sign of its onset in children is as follows: it occurs with a stricture during breathing and movement; and you find it at the last vertebra of the Dorsal column and nodules, which have already begun to stand out above the remaining vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and are able to do so, then cauterize it with a cautery that is in the shape of this circle.
And take the cautery to cover every part of the vertebra evenly; and if you are able to cauterize around the vertebra with a cautery that has two or three points, they should be close together.
Then take care of the place until it heals as we have said.
And be careful not to administer cautery on a protrusion that occurs from muscle spasm.
Regarding the manner of cauterizing in Gout and joint pains.
When the pains of joints are caused by cold humors that flow into any part of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is a common practice among physicians to call this Gout properly. (This seems like an incomplete instruction or heading within Albucasis' medical text on Podagra and might require additional context for accurate translation).
Therefore, when treating Gout caused by cold with methods of healing and if the pangs do not subside, then remove them with a cautery. (This sentence seems to be incomplete or out of context; it might refer to specific procedures detailed elsewhere in Albucasis' text on Podagra).
And it is as follows: after evacuating around the joints of the feet with a cautery using many cauldrons; and the cautery should be made of Olive oil. (This instruction might refer to specific details on how and what type of cauterization tools are to be used in treating Podagcu as described by Albucasis, though it appears incomplete without additional text).
And if you find that there are points on the sole of the foot, then do with a cautery at these points. (Note: This translation assumes that "faciem pedis" refers to the sole and is consistent with medical terminology; however, without further If the pain rises up to the knees or other joints, and this often occurs, then one should cauterize it with three cauteries on each knee, or four from all sides, using the same caustic as Galen's.
However, if you need more of this caustic, then apply it in the following manner: And do not immerse your hand with the caustic; let there be only a slight thickness of skin at most.
If however pain rises to the knees and back: then apply what we mentioned from the caustic in that chapter.
If pain is only in the hands, then make two points around the fingertips like parallel lines.
However, if pain remains in the fingers, then make two points on them, one over each knuckle and above the palm of the hand.
However, if pain rises to the ankles or shoulders after days: then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not quickly release a sick person from good management through the reception of medicine. For if good management is done and phlegm is released, it will be healed with God's help by this caustic.
On the method of applying a caustic for ruptures.
When a rupture happens in the groins and intestines or swelling descends to the testicles, and this is close by: then it should be instructed that on its own day, one should relieve the patient from a dietary regimen. And he/she should follow an easy diet to let feces go through their digestive tract.
Then they should sit between your hands on their back and instruct them to hold their breathing until feces are discharged or swelling appears of the intestines.
Then with your fingers bring it back and make signs with an encaustic under the Roughness on the beak of the nose, with a sign whose tip is similar to halfway around the upper body.
Then with the fire cautery, which has this form, until white appears and it throws out small sparks. Then straighten the intestine or lead it to its own bend. Then let the attendant place his hand over it so that the intangible does not exit: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick man, and placed under it some filth, and another servant on its shanks, and another above its chest who holds the hand.
Then lay down the fire cautery over that mark with your hand while standing straight holding the fire cautery. And hold it, until you reach that mark with it: or try again with another one if you have not reached up to the mouth with it so far.
And carefully observe whether the intangible comes out during your cauterization at that hour, lest you burn it up, and let it heal through that over the sick man or death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach with a fire cautery to the mouth, your operation does not succeed.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate, according to their measure.
Then take care with the remaining ointments until healed.
And let the sick man lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you place nourishment for him according to the length of his healing time, which will soften his bowels: so that the intangible does not exit in difficulty and evacuation.
Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then provide a misaligned bandage, and hold it for another forty days with others.
And it would be lessened by labor and nourishment with food and drink, and strong words.
For when he uses this treatment, thus is completely cured.
And I say that the treatment for ruptures with incision is found in his chapter.
When however ruptures occur in the rest of his belly, and are beginning to form, and it is necessary that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round caustic according to its amount: and let what has been burned be as much as one third of it. Then take care of it, just as we said: and do not increase.
And now some first authors have said: that the rupture should be cuted with a triangular caustic, according to this shape.
After it is signed with the caustic, and a line is placed across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line towards below. And place your hand in the middle with a small caustic.
But first caustics are easier and better.
§ Thus the method of cauterizing pain caused by cases or impacts:
Chapter 98.
When such pain occurs from an accident or impact on certain limbs; and the pain persists over a long time, and does not yield to it with remedies: then one ought to cauterize it with punctures using caustic.
And let the caustic of every limb be a second caustcu according to its size and weakness, and strength, and position, and pain from it.
If therefore one is cured by first caustics, that is good. If not: then repeat the second caustic over it.
For the custom of such pains is that they are transferred from one limb to another that is close to it. Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with a caustic instrument until healed.
Regarding the method of cauterization for leprosy.
However, lepers are often treated with a caustic instrument during intense inflammebies. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while incorporating an Especially the leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider it for cauterization. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while incorporating more constraints such as specifying the type of leprosy and suggesting a particular consideration.)
But if the leprosy is unrelenting and you have treated it with what we discussed in the division [of methods], and it does not diminish or stay: when you grasp its comprehensive corruption: then cauterize him over five caustics on his head: one in the middle of the forehead, secondly toward the front near the end of the hairs, and two above each temple, and one behind the nape. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding specific details on how cauterization should be applied for a persistent case of leprosy.)
And with your last hand slightly at the caustic [instrument], until it makes a shallow impression on his mouth, and the bones are loosened from him: so that he may exhale heavy vapors from him, and cauterize also over the spleen itself with the same caustic, according to what preceded. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding specific instructions on additional points for cauterization in a leprosy treatment.)
But if the leprosy has already spread over him and appears manifestly: then it is necessary to follow with those caustics which we discussed for his head, and a caustic at the end of his nose, and two caustics on each cheek, and two along the neck vertebrae, and six more down the back vertebrae, and one large one near the groin by the great tailbone and one over it: and two under the armpits, that is, one over all of an arm and two above the knees; one over each entire leg, and two at both shoulders, and two on both elbows, and two on his tender chest areas: and cauterize him everywhere where joints are present, from the fingers' joints of his hands and feet, and cauterize all foot heels, as well as fingertips. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding exhaustive details on how cauterization should be applied in a case where leprosy is highly visible across the patient.)
And cut out for yourself from the nerves that are above the last heel bone, so as not to burn them up.
And sometimes when it is branded with a caustic over the bone of the hinge (of the jaw), and another one over the bone of the belly (of the jaw), and another one over the cheekbone.
And you know that the more caustic you apply, the greater is the pain (or suffering), and the more it causes inflammation.
And you know that the weakened person does not find pain from caustic (or branding), as do those who are healthy: therefore, because their body is already numbed.
And it should be that the caustics are of sufficient size and mildness according to the limbs and joints: depending on what was preceded by types (or kinds) of iron instruments.
Then take care for the caustics made from grass flour with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ Concerning how to brand at (the) joints (of the fingers).
When a limb is numbed and it is being treated with medicines, oils, plasters (or bandages), and does not heal, then brand the numbed limb with caustics, according to its size or mildness needed.
And let your caustic be made into a thickness of skin only slightly (or just). Then treat it with an ointamo until healed.
And sometimes it is branded with a numbing (or caustic), which occurs at the hands or feet, on the spinous processes of the back near the exits of nerves that move that limb: and the numbing is removed.
But one should not presume upon this (or it), unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs and on the exit of nerves that move the body.
Chapter 51.
When Albucasis grows old and no longer contributes anything from his medical expertise: then he cauterizes very superficially with the cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Then care for it with grass meal and flax oil, and with leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and hyrax blood: each part is one half: these are mixed together and applied to the cloth, and adhere to the place until healed.
On how to perform cauterization for a carbuncle.
When a carbuncle is beginning and the fluid collects within it: then one should perform casterization with a circular cautery around its circumference as if returning to normal.
However, wise ones have said that it should be cauterized by the last cautery in the middle.
For me, however, that does not seem right: for I am afraid it will become an ulcer: and indeed I have seen this happen several times.
And more correctly, to cauterize around it with a circle as we said: or with multiple cauteries.
On how to perform cauterization for adubeltatis (abscesses).
When someone has adubeltatis that are delayed in maturing or due to an excess making it so or because of the infirmity of old age when one is weakened with little blood, or because of time and the fluid is hastening the maturation of adubeltatis, then one should cauterize around it with many small cauteries puncturing. Then remove it (the abscess). For the abscess will hasten its own maturation.
But if one sees a hole in it with a cautery, then this is the form of the fire-cautery.
And place it on the middle of the abscess until it pierces the skin; and let there be a caustic from what follows weakened, so that it may relieve the course of cleansing.
Then care for it until it heals.
Thus begins the method of causticizing in a very corrosive manner.
Title: Chapter LIV.
Corrosion is nothing but decay within a walking limb and it eats away at it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corrosion in a place that can withstand caustic heat with fire, then use many small and large tongs for the fire as befits the location of the corrosion.
Then causticize it from every part until you completely remove the decay, and nothing remains of it forever.
Then lay the causticized part aside for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil over the areas that were causticized until all scabs are removed and any decay is gone completely.
Afterward, care for it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh.
If then you see, after three days, healthy new skin is growing where there is no decay, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the caustic treatment over what remains of the places that were decayed.
And a corrosion is treated with sharp medicine occasionally. For it indeed arises at the site of caustic treatment.
But indeed caustic treatment with fire is a more rapid remedy; and I have already said that the method of causticizing with sharp medicine should be separated out, so accept it when you find those circumstances to need it.
Thus begins the method of causticizing in clavicles and varices.
Title: Chapter LI.
This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a bulging, filtering condition that damages the foot.
Indeed, there are two kinds of cautery among them: cautery with fire, and cabality with hot water.
However, the kind of cautery with fire is made similar to a burned feather of an eagle's wings: it is done from iron according to the amount that contains nails on all sides; and has fine edges.
Then place the heated one onto the nails. Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the nail until it reaches deep into the nnail; and release it for three days, until it starts to emit pus. Then apply a paste on it with good white lead, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight. For indeed it will be removed from its roots.
Then take care of the area with a restorative ointment for skin until it heals.
If they are not converted and frequently occur on the body's surface, especially in hands and feet: then administer cautery with hot water to them: and it is as if you take a cannula made of iron or from an eagle's wing feather: and place it onto the nail or althelul. Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula: keep your hand held and revolve it with a slight compression from your hand such that the edge of the cannula is pressed to the nail root, and finds the path for hot water deep down to the root: and wait patiently over the sting of the hot water for one hour.
Then release it, for indeed the nail will be removed with its roots.
Do so once a day until you have dealt with all of them that are on the body.
Then take care of those areas after they are removed as if nourishing the skin with a restorative ointment.
The method for cauterizing in tremor.
When tremor due to cold or quartan fever or something else occurs: then one must cauterize it with four caustic applications, or five above the spinal vertebrae of the back, and on every intervertebral space with a caustic application, and in its chest cavity with a caustic application, and over its stomach with a caustic application.
The tremor rests with an olive oil caustic, and health quickly escapes the cold sickness.
The method of cauterizing Albatthir.
Head LXVII.
Sometimes Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules formed by rotting materials.
Therefore, when they first appear, one should cauterize them with a delicate caustic over the entire head of each pustule, with the extremity being lit on fire. or with the root of long-leafed aristolochea. or with a lentil caustic.
And sometimes they are cauterized by an amenuolus: at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and excess is broken off from them, and heals out of them.
However, it should be done after evacuation with bleeding.
The method of cauterizing the flow of blood from an artery to a wound.
The flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near a wound often occurs due to external factors or at the site of excoriation and caustic application of limbs, and similar things: and it is difficult to separate them.
Whenever this happens to someone, then quickly with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place over it your index finger: and press it firmly until blood is absorbed under your fingertip, and nothing flows out from it.
Then place a small piece of olive oil on fire and add many others; blow over it until they are very well lit.
Then take one or several or a large piece from them, according to the wound and where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery over the vein; after you retract your finger quickly: hold the caster until the blood separates.
If the liquid is ejected when you withdraw your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the caster, then quickly take another one prepared among those that are on fire.
Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other until the blood separates.
And be careful that you do not burn the nerves that are there; and prevent any harm from happening to the sick person.
And you know that when the blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to separate it; especially if the arnery is large, unless with one of four methods. Or with a caster, as we have said. Or by removal, when it cannot be removed. For when it is extracted, the ends contract, and the blood separates. Or tied with a strong thread. Or placed on it of the medicine's property to separate blood and compressed with an appropriate tourniquet.
Whoever performs the separation with a bandage and compression with cloth or placing things that burn, does not provide him fully unless rarely.
But if it happens to someone and there is no physician or medicine present: then begin with placing the index finger over the vein's opening as we have said, and strong compression of it, until he is pressed from above by the wound part, and over the artery. And the finger must not be removed; while pouring water of a strong coldness over it from above, wait until the blood coagulates and thickens, and then cut away.
And meanwhile, consider what is needed with regard to a caustic or medicine for that.
On cutting into wounds and similar injuries such as perforations and phlebotomy.
Now as we said in Chapter One, of all illnesses that require the use of a heating caustic and its burning medicine, the cases themselves, their causes, tools used, and forms of cauteries.
And I have put up chapters from top to foot here.
And I will proceed in this chapter the same way as before: by soothing what is sought therein.
And before I begin that, it must be added by you, my son, what is herein in this chapter on the terror mentioned in Chapter One about cauterization.
And for this reason, it is necessary to be more careful about that operation which is herein mentioned, because there are often bouts of vomiting with blood accompanying the life at an opening or incision above a boil, or on an exit wound, or healing a wound, or extraction of an arrowhead, or incision over a stone (like bladder stones), and similar cases: from all these there is associated trembling, fear, and death in many of them.
And I advise you not to be afraid of that which involves hesitation for it sometimes happens on your part in this art with the sick people and their illness types. And from them there is one who gets angry with his own sickness and has a slight death: because of the intensity he found it from his illness and the length of its malignancy. And when illness is from fear meaning death.
And there are those who give you their flute and wish for your well-beaning with it, but its illness is harmful.
Therefore, it does not mean that one should allow those who come to you from them whose manner is such. And let your caution be stronger than your desire and your greed. And do not assume anything from it unless after confirmed knowledge that establishes this among you by a praiseworthy succession.
And make use of prognosis and indication for every sick person's treatment that is fittingly healthy.
For in this there is assistance to you over the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, my sons, with understanding and not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
And indeed I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from hair to feet: that it may ease you of what you sought from it and where you lack.
¶ Regarding the treatment of Water which is included in the chapters about boys.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often occurs in boys at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentlenamen.
And also whenever it happens from a hidden cause which is not understood.
And indeed I myself have not seen this sickness in others than boys, and to all whom from them I saw death approach: therefore it seemed to me to abandon the operation on that.
And indeed I have seen a boy whose head was full of water and his head became magnificent in every day until he could not sit on himself, because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until dead.
Indeed, this moisture is either adhered between the skin and bone, or it is attached underneebone above a fester.
And the operation on this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and a festering wound exists, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head furrow: so that the length of the furrow is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a spider. (Note: The Latin term 'spatul
But if the moisture is increased, and the festering wound is larger, then place two furrows according to this shape. (Note: The Latin term 'spatulam' can be translated as a flat object or tool, but in medical texts of that period, it may refer metaphorically to the spreading form resembling a spider
And if the moisture is underneath the bone and its sign is that you see openings of the head's corners from all sides: and water presses down when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head into three furrows according to this pattern. (Note: The Latin term 'commissura' refers to a meeting or joining point; here it metaphorically suggests that the openings are at key points on the skull)
And after making an incision, remove all the moisture externally. (Note: The Latin word 'extraho' means to draw out Then sew the furrows with bandages and dressings. (Note: In this context, 'stringere' is used in a sense of binding or tightening, which Then apply that above it with wine and oil until the fifth day. (Note: The Latin term 'embrocar' means to tie up; here it refers to bandaging, while 'desuper' means from on top or atop)
Then dissolve the sutures and care for the wound with tents (bandages), and ointments. (Note: The Latin term 'unguenti' refers to a salve or ointment used in healing.)
And do not let go of binding the head equally. (Note: This instruction likely emphasizes maintainamoisture control and equal tension on dress And feed the sick person with dry food in small amounts of moisture, until s/he is comforted and healed. (Note: The Latin word 'cibos' refers to solid or semi-solid food; here it suggests avoiding liquids that might exacerbate the humidity)
And another way of making an incision is to consider where there is the size of swelling and collection of water.
For sometimes it is in the occiput, or on the left parietal bone, or on the right, or on the left side.
So ascend with an incision where there appears to be a swelling and accumulation of water, and cut it as you can do.
And observe that you do not cut the artery, and let blood flow happen, and the sick person dies from this blood flow with evacuation of moisture.
§ Regarding incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Head II.
When there are some catarrhs to the eyes or chest and that is old, and does not provide medical treatment benefit: then more lasting cure is in this one, incision of these two arteries.
Therefore when you are to cut them, that the sick person might clear his head. Then rough place with coarse cloth, so appear the arteries. Then the sick person should wrap his neck with each of his own cloths. Then consider where the blood flows. And both are locations that are places behind ears that are low: and rarely hidden, but only in certain people.
Then signs with a heated wax on both sides: and cut each one with small bandages on either side, coming to the mouth: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you should do this, insert small bandages underneice blood vessels, and cut them upwards with an incision.
And the length of the incision is as two joined fingers.
For when there is an incision, blood comes out with a pulsing flow, which flows to the inner parts frequently.
But if the artery does not appear by touch, then it should be that from ears you measure the space of three fingers' breadth. Then mark with a heated iron and extend it up to the mouth.
And what needs to be poured out from the blood is six ounnces, perhaps more or less. The whole thing according to the amount that appears necessary for you from the sickness and fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if there remains anything from the mouth of the incision, then cut it off so that no hot swelling occurs; then bind the wound with linen threads.
Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ Regarding the extraction of arteries that are located on top of the teeth.
Head III. (This is an abbreviation often
When an old hemicrania or sharp catarrhs occur due to acidic humidities and heat on the temples, or a longstanding congestion with purulent discharge, as well as similar conditions: and it is treated according to methods of medical healing therapy, but not strengthened. Then we have experience in these diseases regarding extraction of arteries from the temebels through cauterization as I have described above.
And the method of the operation for extracting them is, that it should remove the hairs that are on the temples, and aim at the visible artery on the temple. For it is shown to you by its own pulse and rarely hides except in a few men or with severe coldness.
But if it hides from you, then let the sick person bind his head with any of his cloths: then heat the place with a rough cloth. Or soak the area with warm water until it is clearly visible to you. Then take a sponge that I have prepared slightly beforehand. (Note: This response assumes Albucasis' text includes preparation of tools and materials.) Then scrape with it skin along with ease until you reach the artery. (Note: The original Latin phrase "excoria" could potentially refer to any kind of tool suitable for this operation.) Then take out the hook and pull it upwards until you have removed it from the skin, and make it pass through the tunics that are undernecuo, from all parts.
If however an artery is slender: then wind it with the tip of the hook. Then cut from that part according to how much you can lengthen its tips, and contract them, so that blood does not flow. For if it is not incised, and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise upwards.
Then drain from the blood around 6 hemipennies deep until about 3.
Which if the artery is large: then it should be tied up in two places from a thread twice as strong, of silk or horsehair, so that decay does not advance towards it before wound consolidation and blood flows.
Then cut the excess, which is between the two ligaments. Do that at that hour or after another hour.
And if possible, burn it with a cautery up to the bone, using a knife-blade caustic: until its tips are cut off, and it remains in place of that operation.
And it is better to operate, unless if he has a weak fever or hot-blooded temperament. For the causticum is from those which assist in drying up moistures. Therefore it is better to use for treatment.
And after the removal of the arteries, as a place should be filled with old lime paste: and pieces are placed on top centrally made.
And after the cleansing is performed with dry remedies that generate flesh, and linen, until healed.
That if while operating a blood flow happens from the artery, then quickly proceed to cut it with a caustic or fill a space with pitch: and tie your hand, until blood is severed. If there is none of these things present with you, then place it on top of the location of your finger until the blood hardens. And bathe the area with cold water at strong flow, until the heat subsides and it constrictums as necessary.
And because it is lighter and easier to extract the vessel, so that you come with this causticum having two knives; let the sharpness of the two blades be like almagdath (a type of quicklime). However, they are much less sharp than the two knives. Since if it is sharp like the two knives, let each one be cold; and they do not cut meat quickly. Since there is a little thickness in them, it must be heated by fire and quickly cut flesh; thus this makes everything better, easier, and lighter.
And this is the form of causticum (caustic).
And let there be a space between the two knives equal to the thickness of your finger; after you mark two places with encaustrium (a kind of ointment): and lay both ignited on it very much, until they come near their mouths, and cut into the vein at these two places: that what is between its ends may be extended. For with this causticum they do not solidify completely.
Chapter IV.
§ On curing the frequent course of sharp tears from eyes.
When there are frequent tears and the course of them is from vessels that are on top of the skull outside: and nothing supports healing with medicines among these medicines, and his face looks red already, and feels in his forehead walking as it is the walk of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist so that they have corroded their hairs due to corrosion; and his eyelids have been heated by the sharpness of tears: then ancients applied themselves in curing these with this operation, and named it as a cure called Ense.
And so, instruct to pluck the hairs on a sick person' cuff head. Then make three incisions on the forehead equidistant according to its length; and let the length of each fissure be like two fingers, and one is equidistant from the nostril in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the course of the arms, and the third on the other side. Also, cut arteries that are on both sides at the incision; extend your hand lengthwise beyond the continuation of two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be equal to the quantity of three joined fingers: also, have a trough of prepared sponge or many dried cloths with which to absorb excess blood.
Then introduce the tip of two sharp ends, whose next is the following form: From the incision that is on the temple side to the second incision: and peel with it all skin, which lies between two incisions, along with ichthyosis, which is above the bone. Then do also from the middle incision to the second incision: (...) Then remove the sharp tip and insert it again into the first incision with another tool called a cutting knife, from one side flat, not sharp on the other side: (...) And this is its form: (...)
And place its sharp side against the attached skin and fat with the skin, and its flat side against the bone: and push it so that it reaches the middle furrow: and cut off together all tissue, which descends from the head to the eyes, except for continuing up to where the skin is apparent: (...)
Then do also until the middle furrow to the other furrow: (...)
And when it flows with an amount equal to blood, press out places from the lump of clotted blood: (...)
Then place lime into every crack using old baked clay, and put soaked bran over them with wine, vinegar, or oil. And ensure that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day dissolve the bandage and apply plenty of warm fluid infusion. Then treat it with a basilisk ointnent, and other remedies used to heal wounds; whether it is healed.
Head V.
Of the treatment for sharp tears and eyelid inflammation from within the head, for the eyes.
When sharp tears and acute inflammation occur frequently, are severe, continuous; and one sees his eyes tired, thinning, with their appearance already weakened: eyelids ulcerated, hairs falling from them, and there is a deep pain in the head that is intense, injurious, and followed by sneezing. Then take measures against these events such as those substances whereby tears and inflammation do not come unless from many vessels.
And a better treatment for them is this. And it should be as you instruct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make one cut in the forehead fissure, or slightly across its width; and start with a cut from the left temple to the right: and let the incision go as far as the mouth: and extend your hand from the temples that move during chewing: until it is detected by touching; and dry up all blood with a sponge.
Then separate between two lips of the fissure using old baked clay, or with linen-based lime. Then bind from above with bran: and soak the bran in wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess occurring.
And when you dissolve it and see that a hot abscess is already imminent: then it should be brushed with the mouth until meat begins to form therein.
Then care for the wound with an embrocation that generates flesh, as if you received two parts from flour and four parts from colophony: prepare a plaster from these and apply it to birth new flesh on these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Then care for the matter that falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is of four kinds: a mineral stone or something similar to it, like iron and glass; or it comes from plants, like beans and chickpeas; or it is a fluid substance, like water and vinegcups; or it is an animal.
Whenever such a stone or similar mineral comes into the ear and does not grow there, expose the ear to air; if you see the stone, then extract something from it with olive oil or saffron. Then administer the extraction and make him sneeze with compresses, and pour liquid into the nostrils at the onset of the sneezing, after placing cotton or wool scraps around the ear and extending it upward.
Often this matter comes out with such care.
But if it does not come out, then give the extractions with fine substances such as "Gesti" (a medieval term for medicinal preparations), which are of this form.
If it comes out with these preparations, that is good.
And if not, then give the extractions with a fine hook made from unicorn's horn in small amounts of duplicate doses.
If it still does not come out with that, then make a tube from metal and insert the tip of the tube deeply into the ear canal, and pour liquid around the circumference of the tube with thickened wax mixed with oil so that there is no wind but only through the tune: then extract with your strong attraction.
Many times indeed it exits with what we have mentioned. However, if it does not come out this way; then take some helkalimbat or oil, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have drilled there correctly placed cotum; then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear.
However, if it does not come out with everything that we have mentioned; then quickly proceed to cutting before a hot inflammation or convulsion occurs.
And the method of making an incision is that phlebotomists should first treat a sick person in the head; and extract from him blood according to its strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find a small incision in the root of the ear at fatty tissue in a sunken place: and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach stone; then remove it with that which is possible to you by instruments.
Then close the incision from your side quickly, and care for it until healed.
That if something falling into the ear is from one of those grains that grow and swell; then provide its removal.
However, if it does not comply with you for the exit, then take a very fine and subtle ointn in this manner.
And apply with that an incision of the same kind as from grains falling into the ear, and do not make this when you think it is already moistened by the humidity of the ear until you put many fragments; then remove those with a hook or with a subtle instrument or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is facilitated.
However, the water that enters the ear should be used by an invalid through sneezing first: and now it has filled its own ear with something quite cooked from before: and is lying on top of the ear where there is water. If it therefore comes out from that, it is good.
And if not: then take many small and light stones, according to the length of your finger, heat them slightly with fire, and let the invalid insert one into his earhole: and he should jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone over the stone placed in the ear. Not therefore stop doing this with a stone and a stone, until all water has come out.
And now the water comes out so that you receive one from embers or from a reed, and insert the tip of it into the ear: and set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it burns up. Then take another reed, and do that many times, until all water has come out: and extract the same with a tube as previously mentioned in stone.
However, for the extraction of animals entering into it, if they are like body hairs such as lice, take care of them as I said in division.
But if it is of large body parts that are visible to the touch: then manage its extra cuffing with hooks, and needles: and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
However, for the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you attend to them with what we discussed in division and dilatations, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sunlight. If however something appears to be from worms there: then extract it with hooks or with fine needles.
If however nothing appears here, then take the tube, which is this shape, narrow below and wide above: and insert the delicate tip into the ear according to the amount that the sick person can bear; then squeeze it out with a strong suction. Repeat that many times until all worms have come out.
If however they do not obey you to leave, then surround the tube with a plug of wax as I said on the stone.
If they do not leave as I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients experienced to be effective against worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be as when you poured oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. Thus see to make it from silver or copper, narrow below and having a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let the thing that is inserted into the depression of the tangle be made centrally from copper. And if you wish, take the rod, and wind it with a moderate taper at its end; then pour oil, or suction, or whatever of these remedangs you put into the tube; let them be in the ear; then insert the rod with its wound part upwards, and squeeze out with your hand's mild pressure, until the oil is pushed to the depression of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear, should already be heated slightly by fire; and let there not be anything that distills in cold. For remedies do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII. (This indicates the beginning of Chapter
§ On the treatment of a sudden gush of gold. (This would mark the start of a new section or chapter addressing
Sometimes certain children are born from their mothers' wombs not yet pierced. (Referring to cases where a child is born with the umbilical cord still attached.)
And now it has also happened to certain men due to pressure in the ear canal from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
And this pressure sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not produce any sensation; and at times it happens to the exterior part, and a smell is produced from it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, of which there is no perception, is difficult to heal in many cases.
And for that from which a smell is produced, it should be placed with the injured ear facing upwards, and examined in it; then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a very fine sponge like this one shown here, whose edge has a small width, part of which is sharp: and let the remaining sponzoe have two smooth edges so that it does not injure the ear.
If then this blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a very fine hook and cut it off easily with a sharp instrument until all flesh has been removed.
If this pressure is deep within the ear: then take a very thin rod and heat it slightly, and insert it into the ear canal.
If then you sense blockage with that which was found by the patient with an increase of hearing loss, try to open it with ease: and be careful not to injure the nerves in the ear.
Then place an ointment according to the width of the ear canal that you opened up in Egyptian oil for several days, until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Or take an ointcuy and pour it into rose water, and powdered with finely ground unguent use that one.
And if you see the ear is now beginning to swell: then it should be removed of the ointment, and allowed to stay with another ointment that was made earlier from a mixture with rose oil, until the swelling becomes warm: then continue to care for it until it heals.
If however blood flow occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place a metal container on top of it; and use the remaining treatment that causes the predicted blood flow to cease as described in the treatise on distillations.
Regarding the cure for eyelids.
Chapter ([VIII.]).
These eyelashes that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you must hold them with tweezebrushes or hooks, and cut them off at the roots with scissors. Then place something like wax on those spots.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
And it is better to cauterize them after an incision. For many times they return when something remains at their roots. And when they are burned with fire, those roots are charred and do not return.
Regarding the cure for hemorrhoids of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter ([IX.]).
Many times something occurs in the eyelids that resembles Crandini due to its strength and toughness, and for this reason it is called Grand; and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper e  yelid and lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that then you should consider if it is Grand proceeding from there and moving to every part, and its nature is easy.
So therefore make a cut over it across the width. Then peel it off from all sides with ease until it retreats. Then suspend it with a hook and separate the same.
But if it does not prepare a separation for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will harm the weak one in some way.
If the fissure is large: then bind it together with a suture and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For indeed the ointment restores it, and covers it with skin.
And if it is large and descends towards the interior of the ear against the inner surface, then face the eyelid, and suspend the abscess with a hook; besides, you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
For if it extends beyond the eclipsed lid by means of the incision, that does not harm anything at all.
Then wash the eye after draining the abscess with salt water: and care for the place as it heals, until it is cured.
§ On curing the eyelids of Axirna.
Chapter 10.
Axirna is a fat that generates in the envelope of the upper lid: and it certainly happens mostly to boys: and it causes them to have swollen eyes, and they suffer from cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun because tears run towards them, and for this reason, they always lie on their faces, and sleep over them, and their eyelids are damp under their brows due to swelling: and indeed Axirna appears as a prominence in front of the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And its mode of treatment is that the sick person should rest their head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare an ointment in it, and make from that ointment a circle according to the amount contained by Axirna on all sides. Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all parts so that Axirna is gathered in the center of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a patch adhering fissures across its width, and that fissure is not greater than the one made during phlebotomy at depth.
It is necessary to find the skin as a whole until you arrive at Axirnab, since it proceeds from several dispositions of Axirnab out of the fissure according to the shape of white fatigue crumbling.
So extract it with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers to the outside; and roll up your hand towards right and left until dispersed: and be careful not to add in the f groove so as not to come across with a patch at the eye and injure him.
But if it does not appear to you as a beginning of the fissure, you will add into the fissure little by little until Axirnab proceeds. Then extract it as we have said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the spot, and bind it with bandages.
And there are people who use salt, and place it in the depression of the fissure so that what remains from that moisture melts.
Then care for it until healed.
But if this happens at a warm abscess, then care for it with cool poultices until healed.
Regarding the methods of Axirnab eye, that is when the eyelid softens the eyes, from where it rises as it should not.
Head XI.
When hairs are born in the eyelids beyond the course of natural lashangs and grow old: then these harm the eye, and cause diseases such as frequent tears, swelling of the eyelids, and pigmentation until it leads to destruction of the eye.
Indeed, Atzamir'ps eyes are treated in four ways. Or by cautery with fire. or with strong medicine, as previously explained in the chapter on cautery. Or Atzamir is treated by cutting and stitching. or through tubes, as I will explain.
It is necessary to place the sick person's head in your lap. Then, with your left hand, lift the eyelid of the eye.
If so, it is good. And if not: insert the needle there, where a thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle pass over it upwards, so that it lies near the hairs themselves, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread towards the upper eyelid, and lift it with a rod.
Then find inside of the eyelid among the added hairs, adjacent to the ointment from the major tear duct down to the minor tear duct:
Then remove the thread and place under the eyelid patches of cotton wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with beeswax, as shown in the figure of a myrtle leaf.
However, it must be done according to the shape and elevation of the eyelid, for that has been diversified among people for a long time.
For it is the case with those who need to be cut from the upper eyelid where there is a large quantity, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Then with the ointment find over two lines that you marked and begin from the major tear duct to the minor tearabuilding, and let one opening be near natural hairs as is a ray's thickness.
Then insert the needle into one of the two corners of the skin. Then remove the tumor completely. Then gather the wound edges and suture them together with a needle and fine silk thread; clean away blood, ensnare any excess from the stitches above the two eyelids using some unguents if you wish to do so; and if not, don't worry about it.
Then remove the stitches and threads after three or four days; afterwards treat that area.
And if you wish to do so, release the wound without stitches, and then treat it with something that dries up and tightens. For an eyelid is injured near the sealing of a wound and its gathering; but it will be better in the future.
This method of treatment was taught by the ancient Atamimi.
However, there is concern over the ill person, and it's a good surgical procedure, without fear involved.
And there is another method among the Atamimi as well; it involves signs above an eyelid resembling the shape of a myrtle leaf, which we have described.
Then treat the eyelid with three separated or gathered hooks according to this shape that follows; then cut off what is excessive with scissors as per this method in an equal manner of incision.
But if it's not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not equalize; then take an awl where there is thread, and insert that into the middle of the shape; also introduce another thread near a larger tear duct, and another thread near a smaller tearn duct: and gather these threads between your fingers equally.
Then treat the eyelid with your hand's equalizing touch; and treat the skin over which is drawn a line as we have described.
Then gather the wound edges together with stitches: and care for it until healed.
If indeed an abscess occurs at your incision or crack: bind that abscess with wax and similar ointments that soothe.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids as well, turning their hairs.
Therefore, you must be careful with what we have said about the incision: but the stitching of both is more artificial. § On healing with a bandage and comb.
And it is, as you turn the eyelid, and split the crack that is inside, according to what has been narrated. Then skillfully make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelids, and their width less than the breadth of the space; and you have already made a cut at both ends where you hold the threads from either side.
Then attach each with subtlety over that which overflows from the eye's eyelid, and bind two canes with strong stitching from either side, and release it for several days. For the skin that is bound will die, become blackened, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If however it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then heal it until it is healed.
And when it hardens, elevate the eyelid: and the hairs do not stick.
And this is the method of making two canes as per this figure, and quantity according to length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
§ On elevating puncturing hairs in the eye with a needle.
The operation is as follows: that you take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, softly. Then attach the ends of that, and knots on both sides with very subtle threads: and the length of the threads one handspan.
Then construct another delicate thread under it and knot its ends.
Then the sick person will place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is declared to be delicate or minute.
Then insert an awl with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it pierce quickly into the eyelid until you extract from above a natural hair.
Then pull out the hair upwards over Alinxlete: and insert a hair into Alinxotee with it; if there is one or two or three, not more than that.
Then pull your hand out together with it until the hair and Alinxotee exit from the eyelid along with a natural hair.
But if Alinxotee is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull Alinxotati downwards, with a thread that you composed in it, until Alinxotati exits from the upper opening and see him by vision of the eye: then indeed pull Alinxotatis, and the thread; and extract both, and close the eye: and release the closed one for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then join it to a long hair from natural hairs and pull out together with it; or let it go until it grows after some space, and then draw it out.
Chapter 13.
When such an occurrence happens in the eye called Alxatrati, it is named Leporine. (Note: This translation preserves the original meaning of the term 'Leporina',
And this Alxatrati is either natural or incidental. (Continuing from the previous solution.)
Therefore, it occurs due to the consolidation of a wound, or division, or caustic burn, and similar things. (Continuing from the previous solution.)
The method of the operation is as follows: you must strengthen that fissure and separate its lips, and place something between them using linen, holding it until healed.
It is not necessary to use those things that cause bleeding and constriction during its treatment; for if you do this, Alxatrati will become worse than before: indeed, treat it with things that soothe, such as fenugreek: boil the ember-tail in water, once cooked with althea seed and flaxseed: use the dyaquilon ointment, made liquid with some oil: apply warmth to that fissure along with it; care for it this way.
Your treasury of treatment is to use all your skill, so that it does not solidify again, according to the initial shape.
This operation we mentioned is merely a correction of Alxatrati's condition, so it does not return to its original form at all.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that is done on the lower eyelid, it is a wrinkle or contraction towards the right and left sides.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatratur that occurs lower down is what is truly called Alxatrati. It is both natural and incidental.
And it happens by wound or fissure or cauterization, and such like things.
The method of the operation is as follows: you must take an awl, where there is a double thread, and dye it on the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear until the threads reach the two ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with an awl and incise it widely using a surgical knife. If, however, it returns to its original shape of the eyelid as it should be, that is good.
And if not, take the radicle and place it into the fissure, and move with it the eyelid; and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and their tips be from the ends of the incision at the two angles, until they come together and an angle is formed: when they join, make this figure which is a Greek letter.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its lower sharp side from what follows the eardrum. Then join together the separated parts with a thread of wool.
Then take care of them as we have said, with soothing substances and liniments, until they are healed.
And if it happens to Alxatrati from the fissure and stitching or cautery: then one must make a flat fissure underneath the eyelashes, as before happened. Then separate between two sides with liniment as we have said.
And the final advice on caring for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that one should proceed with this operation as prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
For it is indeed of many diversities of shape: and a skilled craftsman prepares the nature with whatever means possible until he restores the form to its natural state or near it, and the patient himself, according to what fits him from the operation and instruments in numerous dispositions.
Chapter 15.
¶ On the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people in such a way that the upper eyelid becomes fused with the white of the eye and forbids it from its own natural operations.
Therefore it must be that you insert the tip of the radicle underneath the eyelid and elevate it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adherence with a very fine spatula, so that it is not sharp like the sharpness of the incision on the spatula, but rather blunt slightly: so as not to disturb the patient during the operation and remove the spatula, and injure the eye with its own sharpness: and let your incision be somewhat as if you were excoriating that adherence easily, until when it returns to the eyelid according to its natural form, and is completely healed.
Then at once pour salt water into the eye, as you wash with water; or distill it from sweat made of onions and diluted with water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with linseed oil; place infused wool over the eye; after three days use sweat mixed with substances such as aloes, until it heals.
From cutting the nail and the elevated part of the skin that produces tears.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is in two ways: one growing from beneath the skin, which is round and smooth; the other grows on the surface of the flesh, which And it is nervous; and it is similar to a hard silk, fine. Or it is not nervaberse; similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with cold iron or pincers, breaks off and does not stick to the pincers.
And both kinds do not begin until the main tear fluid reaches them gradually; and they close up, blocking the light, and preventing eye movement.
And the method of operation for that is: place your ill person's head in your lap. Then open his eyes and hold the eyelid with your hand. Then take a nail from the pincer of double thickness, and extend it towards above. Then take a needle and insert it into the thread made from horse's hair, or goat'nish, or wool: and let the thread be strong; and make its end somewhat doubled, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce with the needle through the nail, and tie with a thread around the nail, extending upwards. Then scrape off with hair from the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were cutting with the hair all the way to the end of it.
Then insert the remaining part into the lacrimal duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, and release the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland so that its continuous flow of tears does not occur from this incision.
And sometimes it is extended with a single hook or with thread as we have said. Then it is gently scraped with a fine spatula, which is the method as follows.
And be careful that it does not touch the corneal tissue with a spatula, causing a tear and puncturing the pupil.
Then after the incision, produce some crushed salt or a solution made from cinnaminus into the eye, and remove it until the next day. Then care for it with what is needed until healed.
If the nail is not hardened and you cannot insert a hook into it or fix the hook in place, then this type of nail should be treated multiple times with medicines, and will heal as explained in the section on division (surgery).
If you wish to make an incision on it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, weak spatula as per this method. And smoothly scrape the nail from top downwards with delicacy. If you see that it is thinning out and breaking, and leaves a mark on it, then draw from your own time into the eye with a solution made from cinnaminus or red saffron, or crushed salt: and moisten the eye until the next day.
Then repeat over that operation until all of it is removed. Unless there is an infected ulcer in the eye: then leave it alone and care for the ulcer until healed.
Then repeat the operation over that with scraping until healed.
However, the prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it causes great harm to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part; and do not finish the incision so that the flow of tears does not stop.
Then insert a small rubber plug or one made of ivory into the tear duct until it heals.
Regarding an incision on an eyelid cyst and native tissue within the eye.
Chapter XVII.
It arises at times in certain human eyes composed of red flesh or placed over it, until it covers the pupil, approaches closely, tightens above the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it is similar to a rose thorn. (Note: This seems like a description related to an ocular condition rather than a surgical procedure.)
And the operation on this also requires you to place the afflicted head within your bosom. (Note: This appears to be an exhortation rather than a surgical instruction.) Then open his eyes and cleanse the entire flesh with hooks suitable for this: and hold it with one forceps or a clamp. (Note: This could be part of a description for an eye-related surgical procedure.)
Then incise the flesh first until you finish it completely with a cutting instrument. (Note: Although this is instructional language regarding tissue removal, without additional context or understanding of Albucasis's methods and terminology as they translate to modern And cauterize around the eye so as not to damage it during surgery: and let your incision be such as you cut into the nail (as we mentioned in the chapter on cutting a toenail), or with spatulas, which are used for gathering lint, according to the shape that comes after this section. (Note: The text refers to specific instruments and procedures related to eye surgery.)
And when your incision is completed and the whole eyelid cyst has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powdered medicine: and place over the exposed eye a comb of white albugineum (a fine substance used for medicinal purposes): to ensure protection from heat scabs. (Note: This instruction appears to be related to post-operative care in eye surgery.)
If there remains something of the algomenis and warm blood prevails, and a warm suppurate occurs: then release the eye, and treat it as you would calm the suppuration.
Then repeat over it with the treatment until healed.
And similarly, act with added flesh that occurs on the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you operate with a foreign treatment of the weakened eye from either natural or accidental ways: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you see that this body part can endure such an operation.
¶ On collecting pus from the eye.
Head XVIII.
The sebel are red veins that form on the eye and hinder its vision: and weaken the eye over time.
Therefore, you must first consider if the eye where there is sebel is strong and does not have any other sickness besides sebel: then collect that sebel from it.
And instruct the sick one to place his head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with a hook or two according to your wisdom: and the hook should be of fine double thickness, as indicated, or there are two hooks gradually formed together in one body, as indicated.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors delicately and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you see that these veins have been removed from the eye, and dissolved: and be careful not to harm the eye with sharp edges.
And your operation should be at midday under the sun and you must be very firm in your work: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then pour into the eye a yellowish or reddish sap-like substance: so that its sharpness may caress what remained from the sebel.
If however you are unable to gather the whole thing at that time, then apply an ointment to the eye which alleviates ocular pain; and let it remain for several days until the pain subsides: also ensure protection from warm inflammnation; afterwards repeatedly apply to it according to the same method, until healed.
And this is the form of scissors.
Regarding reducing an arrow wound towards the nose.
Head XIX.
The doctors name the wound of Arissa as a fistula; he treats it with caution either by means of cautery or by an acute burning medicine, according to what his report precedes.
And if it does not heal, there is no remedy for this: unless you scrape over the inflammation at his birth and remove all the moisture and pus, until bone appears.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see that there is decay or blackness within it, then scrape out the matter with an instrument whose form is this:
And it is called the head of Arissa.
Let it be made of iron drawn out and his head round like a needle; that it be marked with dots by the edge or an aliskillifer pointed mark, or a subtle forged point: and place it over the place where there is bone decay.
Then withdraw it between your fingers and press your hand slightly, until you know that the decay has been scraped off completely: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with extracted pungent remedangs.
If therefore the place is consolidated and flesh grows upon it, and pus separates its course: and there remain forty days, and it does not renew itself, nor inflame, nor any accident befall it; then you know that now it has healed.
And if not, there is no remedy within it unless reduce the fistula to the nostril opening according to this method:
And it is as follows to remove the bone with a second iron or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is removed, then take a second tool of this shape, whose tip is iron, triangular: and the wood of that should be a slender pyramid up to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on top of the same bone: and let it be near the tear ducts: and lengthen your hand a little away from the eye. Then move your hand with the tool until it penetramo into the bone and feels weakened: by this means when found wind exiting from there, when they hold their hand on their own nose.
Therefore then restore the place with stipulative drugs that expel pus, as I have taught you.
But when the flesh is born and hardens at that place: then the material which flowed out to the outside returns to the nose: so it becomes lighter over the weakened.
§ On reducing proptosis of the eye.
Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes completely with its entirety, and there is no harm or reduction to vision: then you should release it; afterwards bleed him; afterwards place vapors on his forehead without making an incision, but by suction.
Then place over the eye a poultice made of Acacia and Aloe, as well as Frankincense and Saponaria. Then bind the eye tightly above the poultice with many layers of gauze.
And the manner of gauze is as follows: take light, numerous pieces of cloth and make each piece double over fourfold; then cut out many from them: then place one on top of another according to the amount required by the eye: then bind over those with a band of hard cloth strong enough.
And repeat vapors with suction without incision.
Then remove the stylishly-drawn wineskins, and loosen the tight eye during day and night.
If however the bandage is moistened again, it should then be tightly bound: after this, remove the bandage during day and night, as we have said.
If however you see the eye now recovered with a new bandage, it is good; and if not, then reapply the ointment repeatedly, along with powders, tightening, and wineskins, until healed.
Of cutting through the eyelid's skin.
Head XXI.
When there is a rupture of the eyelid's skin, then it protrudes and extends out beyond the eyelids as a grain of the eye, causing disfigurement to the human form because of this: then the surgical procedure in that [area] is, as I have narrated: and it must be done so as to insert an awl into the root of the eye from its lower part towards its upper part.
Then insert another awl into where the double thread is from the tearful part [of the eye], and make it penetrate through: and loosen the first awl according to its own arrangement.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie it with that part of the eve's skin around the awl: then bind it tightly.
Then remove the awl, and place a cloth soaked with alubar upon the eye: then loosen it until the thread falls out together with the grain of the eye.
Then care for the eye [wound] as long as it is comforted, until the wound heals.
And sometimes when the eyelid is tightened around from all sides with a thread, until the eye protrudes greatly.
Then it is punctured with a thin sponge that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisture comes down from the alubar, and the eye descends, and is immediately inserted: then bind it tightly until healed.
On the treatment of a hunchback.
Chapter 2^3.
This disease called Alcomnati is not just pus accumulated in the eye resembling water descending, and it is not itself.
And the method of operation for this is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat or directly.
Then take its head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus reaching the lower parts of your eyes. Then it is made to stand and does not fall down; the opening is cleared: and let the patient look as he looked before; and if it does not go lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of pus is not prepared as we have mentioned, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a thin layer of lint, and place it gently on the superficial skin tissue just at the junction with the corneal membrane in the crown, until the pebbles come out.
When it is expelled, then distill warm water into the eye with which you mixed honey mead; or water in which you already boiled fennel and honey: then heal with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Chapter on the cure of water that descends into the eye, or cataraster.
Chapter 2^4.
Now we have said the types of water and what is fitting to explain and declare using speech, then take that same thing according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands square to the light and near the sun: and bind his eye with a bandage and tie it tightly: then palpate the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the water is in the left eye: or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Then take your right hand's glove, if the eye is left; or with your left hand's glove, if the eye is right.
Then place the end of the glove near the crown according to the size of the radius in the apparent lacrimal groove of the eye; then push the glove with force and you recoil with your hand, until it enters the sclera of the eye; and feel that the glove has already reached an empty space.
And the measure of the path of the glove to its depth is the space that exists from the pupil to the end of the sclera; and it is the crown of the eye. For you will see them indeed within the very pupil by sight of the eye, because of the transparency of the cornea's membrane.
Then place the glove all the way to where there is water. Then press it below with one edge after another.
If the water therefore descends immediately, then the sick person sees that above which opens his sight at once, and the glove is in its eye.
Then rest a little. If however the water descends, then remove it again secondarily, except that the glove comes out.
Whenever it is stuck and does not rise up: then extract the glove with ease; and you slowly return your hand.
Then dissolve a bit of clear salt crystal in water: and wash the eye from below with it. Then place a full plug or boiled wool in oil of roseate oil, and the sclera; and bind with it a healthy eye.
But we, and those who are ours in this time, place crushed ashes over him with albugine.
This if the glove does not obey you to enter into the eye because of its hardness, as it is a man whose eye is very hard indeed: then it must be that you take a tapered spatula, which is called an alberid, and this is its shape.
Therefore, join with it only the adjacent ligament and do not insert your hand into the hole; and its sole purpose is to create a passage to the almagdum delicately.
Then introduce the almagdamo as we mentioned before.
And for your patient's aftercare, ensure that the bed is centrally placed so they can sleep on their back in a dark room; and movement should be forbidden, as well as coughing; provide them with food that alleviates nature's discomfort; and do not move their head either to the right or left at all.
And let the second ligament remain in its position until the third day.
Then dissolve it in that dark room and inspect their vision: and make them see things clearly. Then reduce the ligament to its original position by the seventh day.
And it is not necessary to do this during the time of curing or immediately after cutting; rather, have others perform it: because water ascends quickly through a strong outpour.
If however a hot abscess occurs: then you should dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with whatever soothes the abscess until it subsides: then restore their vision, and apply something over their face to manage their vision for several days in that dark room.
Then they should gradually leave the house and be instructed in self-care cases.
And know that a student is not exempt from blurred vision several times in zaltese: then they may dare above the surgery.
And indeed it has come to us that a certain person from among those who are from Alairac said, that it was done in the almagdum of Alaicuh, which suggests water.
But indeed do not see anyone on your land who has done it: nor read about it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it might be a new thing.
And these are forms of treatments from Arab medicine, such that they stand over those who do not know them.
Let them be made of copper: and let their ends have this same subtlety in the form of a triangle, and an acute point.
Chapter 2n4.
§ On treating flesh generated within the nose.
Sometimes flesh is generated in the nose for a long time and added with various types, one of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from these are cancerous, stone-like meat; and meaty that is soft, not dark colored.
Therefore, for those that are soft among these meats and not deceitful or cancerous, you should make it sit weakly between your hands opposed to the sun, open its nostrils, and insert a hook into this meat: then pull them outward, and cut what was grasped with a subtle sharp edge from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
That if something remained from it that could not be cut off: then scrape that with a subtle tool easily until nothing remains of it. But if blood dominates over you or a hot suppuration happens: then oppose it with what is appropriate; or if from malign swellings, hurry to cauterize them until the blood separates and all meats are removed.
Then after making an incision, pour vinegar or water or wine into the nose. But if the nose opens and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that he is already healthy.
But if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is meat generated within the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument could not reach with an incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a thread of wool that has some thickness, and put many knots on it; and place between every knot a certain amount of your finger or less; and let the infirmity bend one end of the thread in its nose with a finger, or as much as possible for it after doing so. And pull the smelling oil until it reaches the pus, and comes out over its own throat.
Indeed, they often do a similar thing to this one by Atton's boys in schools; it is an easy matter for those who wish to.
Then place two ends of the thread, one end that comes out over the nose and the other remaining inside the nose. Then give a meat hook with knots on the thread. Make it so that you know that the meats are now with knots on the thread.
Then extract the thread; and place it in the nose after applying the bloodletting liniment that you have soaked in Egyptian oil: do this for three days or more, until the ointamo permeates all that remains from the meats.
Then place at the end of the matter a lead tube in the nose for several days until it is healed.
However, if it requires an expelling treatment, use that one.
To make the head-purging treatment, with which oils and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver or copper: that it be like a small lampadea, open as a shell; and its opening also so.
And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell instrument for making head-purging treatments is full and hollow: that there be a handle at its end, by which you hold it when heating the oil or any other fluid and pliable matter.
Chapter amoenus (25).
Often it is born at the end of the nose's thorn, and it is adorned and increases over days until a disfiguring appearance arises from it.
And because of this, one should extract that growth at the beginning of its appearance and remove all its roots. Then apply something on top of the spot, either a caustic or a burning medicine in place of it.
If the incision is delayed until it swells up and becomes hard with a dark color, then consider if it is a stone, hard, of dull coloration, lacking in feeling: do not touch it with iron since it is an ulcerous cancer.
Often I have seen that one who suffers from a thorn becomes very sick because of it.
And if the thorn is not hard and of a dark color but seems as though an incision can be made entirely through it, then bathe the sick one, and cut into it without fear or hesitation: and heal the place with what comes out from it and constricts, until it heals.
Chapter amoenus (2amo).
§ On stitching of the nose, lips, and ears.
Know that when a rupture of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, there is not much profit from the surgery unless in certain people.
Therefore when something occurs like that, you should then take into consideration if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then join the pains of the wound with stitches: afterwards heal it until it heals.
And if the rupture of continuity has already separated the lips and each part is healthy: then it should be that you remove all parts from the skin appearing on them until they bleed. Then, gather the two lips with a suture and tighten them, and sprinkle pulverized dragon's blood on it, along with ground olibanum. Place above the powders a piece of diaphragm plaster, or from another consolidated paste: and release the bandage for two days or three. Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and let it rest until the threads separate on their own. Then treat it with ointment until healed.
The mode of the stitch is to gather a continuity solution or with anesthetic as I mentioned in the nasal stitch: or gather a solution with thread, as you did know it.
Chapter XXVII.
§ From extracting nodes from the lips.
Indeed, many men experience painful and enjoyable lumps inside their lips similar to hard grains of grass: and some of them are smaller, and larger ones.
Therefore, you should turn the lip, and pierce over all its lumps, and hang it with a hook, and cut off from every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with ground zygomatic bone until the blood separates.
Then it should be rubbed with vinegar and treated at the site where there is astringency until wounds heal.
Chapter XXVIII.
§ From cutting the flesh of a calf on the thigh. (This seems out of context, possibly indicating an error or misplacement within the text.)
Often it is born over the thigh skin, which the ancients called an abulus (a type of surgical suture).
Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut near its root, then release the wound to run freely or let the blood flow.
Then place over the grounded zygomatic bone or other astringent and scurf-removing powders. (The Latin seems to be somewhat garbled; this could possibly refer to applying a specific type of medicinal powder.)
If that flesh returns after the healing process, since it often returns, then incise it a second time and burn it; for indeed, this does not return after being cauterized.
Chapter 2anno.
Of tooth decay with iron.
Whenever they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both interior and exterior parts, and between sharp gums, ugly, and sometimes turn black, and become yellowish, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul because of this.
Therefore, make it sit sick between your hands, and its head in the hollow of your hand, and scrape a molar tooth and a tooth, where you see the cortex appears: until nothing remains from them, and do similarly with blackness, yellowness, greenness, and other things until they are cleaned.
But if that which is at the beginning of them is removed, good; and if not, then again perform curing on those three times a day, secondly, and thirdly, until it finally arrives to what you intend by your study.
And know that a tooth needs curing tools of various shapes and figures; according to how your operation is prepared: for the tool with which it cuts from the lower part of the tooth is another than that by which it cuts between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these shapes of curing tools are prepared for you as those you see.
Chapter 30.
Of the extraction of tooth pain.
It is necessary that you treat a tooth with its own pain with every ability and gradually in removing it. For it is not that which supplies the pain when it is removed: because it is an elevated substance: until there is no excuse for its removal, then when you think of making it sick, you must remove it to strengthen and certify the tooth in pain among you.
Many times he deceives himself about the pain of the sick one, thinking that it is because there is a decayed tooth and removing it will reluctantly, the pain does not cease until the weakened tooth is removed.
We have now seen this thing from the action of those who perform bloodletting.
Thus, when you are sure of the painful tooth itself, then it is necessary that you incise around the tooth with a spatula-like instrument where there is some strength, until the gum is loosened from all sides: afterwards move the same thing with your fingers or with subtle pliers at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then those places you should then with large pliers properly located, and the head of the sick person between your fingers: which you have already well held so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth straight ahead so as not to break it.
If however, it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did firstly.
If however the toaster is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and fasten it with a subtle wire at its extremity, so that it does not break in your hour of squeezing on top of it with pliers.
And you should carefully act with incision around the gum from all sides greatly.
And preserve your strength so that you do not break it, and let a part of it remain, and be healed above the sick one from the great harm that caused its initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what the unskilled bloodlettors do in their haste and boldness over removing it, besides administering that which we have mentioned.
Many times they happen to come upon great weaknesses in people, whose more difficult ones break and all its roots remain, or some of them: or that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw-bone: as we have often witnessed such things.
Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or vinegar and salt.
If there is a flow of blood from the areas (for this often happens), then take some earth and fill that place with it; and if not, cauterize it if you do not have enough earth.
The forms of the delicate forceps which are used to mold denseness should have long handles, short shanks, thick bodies so that they dore not double when pressed against a tooth: they should be like you see in large jawbones until when you clamp them and they don't snap themselves or fold over; the extremities should be thin and made of iron or properly forged steel with straight ends, and there should be teeth at their extremities that are inserted into some places and maintain an appropriate tension.
And sometimes the tips made like a bird's beak called "ciconia" are strong enough for ties.
Chapter 31.
Regarding the removal of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
When a tooth that has broken remains after removal, then you must place something like butter over the spot for one or two days until it softens; afterwards insert algasti or forceps which have tips similar to a bird's beak called "ciconia". This is how these forceps are shaped.
Their tips should be made like an inner file, or like "aliskilfegi".
If therefore the root does not give way to you with these forceps, then it is necessary for you to chisel over the root, and expose all flesh, and insert an instrument called a small palancata, which has this shape: [describe or illustrate the tool's specific shape here if needed].
They should have short tips and be quite thick; and not be soaked, lest they break.
If therefore the root is removed through this [method], it is good; and if not, one must help with other instruments whose forms are such as these.
The shape of the first triangular tip, which has some thickness.
The shape of the slender triangular tip.
And with other instruments and tools that came before in tooth extraction.
Also be of aid with this instrument resembling a large hook, which is the form of a curved triangle's tip at its end, which has some thickness, so that it may not break: and let it not be moistened.
And know that there are many instruments for the teeth: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and a skilled artisan, subtle in his art, found by himself an instrument as it signifies to him the operation and the pains themselves.
For there are instruments from which the ancients did not speak of a thing, because of the diversity of their kinds.
If however the bone from the jaw breaks or from other facial bacteria or putrefies: then to search over this in its place with that which suits it among instruments and pliers as I said of root extraction, and help with those whose form is such.
Be there somewhat thickening gradually, as it is tightened or held with the bone, and does not flee and goes until the bone comes out: and be restored to place with appropriate medicines for this.
If however there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrap off that putrefaction from itself, and care for it until healed.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the notable door lock on others.
When teeth do not stand out according to their natural course, it is foul by that shape: and especially when this occurs among women, and girls, namely prostitutes.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to consider. For if a tooth has been born after another and it does not stand alone, or its clasping can be done, nor the grinding of itself: then extract it; and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it off using this instrument, which is as follows.
It resembles a small face, and it is made of sharpened iron, with very sharp edges.
And let your cut be such that it is made over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that other teeth are not moved.
But if it is exposed by its own grinding tool: then use a grinder with an iron blade, which has this form.
It is entirely made of iron, and the handle of its sharp points is very sharp, like a grinder with which needles are made: it slowly grinds the tooth over many days with ease, so that the toaster does not move, but falls off: then gently remove it, finally scraping it off with some rasors.
That if it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue; then you must also smooth it out until that roughness of the fracture is removed, and leveled: it becomes flat, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupts speech.
Chapter 33.
Regarding tooth cutting with gold wires.
When anterior teeth have been knocked out or shaken by percussion or accident; and the patient cannot firmly clench anything over what has been bitten off so that it does not fall out: and after being treated with medicinal astringents, treatment was ineffective: then their nature is such that they should be clamped with gold wire; because silver turns blackish, and decays after some days: but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount it can hold between teeth.
Indeed, the form of the incision is such that you should take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then tear it apart with both ends between the moved teeth, whether there is one or several, until you reach the tissue up to the healthamoingr other side. Then continue to examine the part from which you incised; and with your hand, be gentle and wise, until it is completely removed: let the constriction of your threading, at the roots of teeth, so that it does not loosen up.
Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and bring them together, and turn them over: then hide them between a healthy tooth and a moved one so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be tightened until it remains.
If however it is loosed or cut, bind them with a thread of another, and let them stand together for such time as whole.
And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of an incision between two healthy teeth, and between two moved teeth, as you see it.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth are returned to their places after an accident on both sides, and remain as we described, and stay in place: but this is done only by a skilled, wise, and experienced craftsader.
And sometimes it is adjusted to a piece of bone from the vagina; and made like the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place where it strengthens and binds a tooth, as we said: and remains, and serves for such a long time.
Head 34.
Sometimes the membrane which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or incidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation on it is as follows: open up the sickened bone within its head in your hollow, and elevate its tongue; then incise that nerve band across its width until the tongue is released from its restraint.
If there be something of hardness and knotting in it, and if that is from the consolidation of a wound: then insert an arched hook into it, and pierce through its width, until you cut the ligament, and release the knotting.
And be careful that there is no crack deep within the flesh, and cut into this artery, so that a flow of blood may occur.
Then it should be cleansed with water used for examining wounds, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then place a compress made of linen under the tongue that holds back the sickness every night: so it may not harden again.
However, if there is a flow of blood, then place over the area some finely ground wool. But if blood conquers you, then burn the area with a spotted caustic iron that suits it: and thereafter care for it as in the remainder of its healing until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Occasionally it happens under the tongue a sore that resembles a small frog, preventing its natural function from operating: and perhaps it is enlarged so much until it fills up the bone.
And the operation on it is as follows: open up the sickened bone in its entirety: and regard the sore.
But if you see it of dusky or black color, hard and which the sick person does not feel: then do not touch it, for it is a tumor.
And if it is declining to whiteness, where there is moisture, then insert an arched hook into it, and cut through its interior with a very fine bandage: and release it from all sides. If blood overcomes you during your surgery hour, then place beaten zinc on it until the blood is separated; afterwards return to your surgery and extract the flesh with its dressing.
Then it shall be washed with vinegar and salt; and care for it according to the remaining treatment until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of boils on two tonsils.
Chapter 3n. (Note: This is just a
Sometimes there occur interpharyngeal swellings, that is, glands resembling boils, which appear on the outside; and they are called two tonsils: when you treat them as we have described in division, and do not heal, then consider this.
If the abscess is hard, of dark color, with few sensations: then you should not touch it with a hot iron. (Note: This answer assumes that "fusci" means "dark-colored", which fits within common medical terminology of later medieval Latin texts
And if it is reddish in color and the root of it is large: then you should not touch it with a hot iron even, fearing an outpouring of blood; rather release it until it matures. (Note: The use of "timens" implies caution due to possible hemorrhage.) And then either you will puncture it or it will rupture by itself. (Note: This suggests a choice between two potential interventions for an abscess, reflecting
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut into it. (Note: The instruction implies a more conservative approach when the abscess appears less threatening.)
And before your operation consider it as if the abscess has been a quiet warm completeness or decreased somewhat: then you must have the patient sit weakly in front of the sun and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth and let the servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument; this is the form. (Note: This instruction outlines a more detailed preparatory procedure involving positioning and assistance from a servant before attempting to incise or treat an abscess.)
Let it be made of silver or bronze, that it may be as sharp as a knife.
So then take a hook and fasten it on the boil; afterwards draw as much of it out as you can outside, but avoid pulling any skin with it.
Then incise it with an instrument whose form is as follows. It resembles forceps; however, its ends should be rounded off, so that the hole of each is sharply opposite to the other. Therefore it should be made from steel or annealed iron.
If this tool is not available, then incise it with a clamp-like object whose form is as follows. It should be sharp on one side but blunt on the other.
And after you have made an incision in one almond, make another cut in the second following the same pattern of incision.
Then, after making the incision, let a sick person rinse with cold water or vinegar and water.
But if he experiences a discharge of blood, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegcu have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle and similar stipulative substances, until the flow of blood stops: then care for it until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses are born on the throat besides the two almonds. Then cut them as I said to be done with the incision of the two almonds equally.
And I myself have already healed a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards gangrene and causing little sensation because it was almost closing her throat: and the woman could breathe through a narrow passage and she had forbidden herself food intake and drinking water: and she was approaching death, if she remained for one day or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it severed two branches until they emerged above two nasal passages.
Therefore, I quickly proceeded and fixed one of its hooks into place. Then I pulled the flesh out, and a large piece came from it.
Then I cut off that part where I caught it in the nasal passage.
Then I did what was coming out of the other nasal passage as well.
Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue: then I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut off that part of it, and nothing ran out but a small amount of blood: so was the woman's throat freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
So I did not stop cutting into that abscess many times over a long period of time: and the abscess kept appearing at the place where I was making cuts until it became too much and with this.
Therefore, I used my ingenuity, and burned the abscess in between the throat.
So it remained after treatment: then I walked away from there, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
On the incision of abscesses for women.
Chapter LXXVII.
When a catarrh descends into the throat of a woman and becomes an abscess, and it is large: then she herself is called perpendicular. And if it is in the lower part thick, round, then she is called uvula.
When it is treated as we have mentioned in the division, and no cure is brought about by that: and you see that the abscess has cooled down from it, and become thin: then you must cut into it.
And what is attached to it round, and has no length, and is of blood color or brownish or black, and does not have sense: then you must make a cut on that. Therefore, there is fear for the sick person in this case.
Therefore, when you see it according to the method I mentioned from whiteness and its length, make the sick person sit facing the sun: then press their tongue with an instrument, as was previously described. Then fix a hook into it, and pull it downward; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I said in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut from it anything except what naturally extends beyond without adding to it.
For if you cut from there too much, it will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils: and care for it until it heals.
However, if the sick person is frightened by the cutting: then you must use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and hesitation.
And there is no method for the cauterization of that, but with sharp water: and it is, as you put your head on your lap. Then press their tongue with an instrument I mentioned. Then take the water I mentioned to you in the chapter of cauterizing and make it with a heated stone that is not burnt: and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill it with the depression made by this instrument, which is its form.
Let the ends of that be hollowed as a medicine hollows the ears' rays.
And place the instrument with medicine over that very same tongue: and let the sick person be lying on his side so that he may flow saliva from his mouth due to internal medication, such that nothing falls into his throat from it, and harm him.
Then hold your hand with medicine in it. And you take from that the first amount equal to half an hour on his tongue, until you see it already darkened and calmed by the biting of medicine.
And if you wish to receive the whole thing, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour the ointment with medicine, and insert the rod with the ointment into the tube from above, until the ointcu adheres to the bone above.
Do that many times, until you achieve what you want of caulking (i.e., burning) the wound. Then release it: for she herself dries and falls after three or four days.
If you wish to irrigate the wound with medicine, repeat it as follows: and after caulking cleanse around the wound with ointment soaked in butter, and purify with what is therein from the medicine: and wash with cold water.
And it shall be treated externally with camphor, and internally by gargling until healed.
Therefore this is the healthier treatment of incision and longer-lasting from fear.
And sometimes the wound is also treated with what is more subtle than caulking and incision: for it is treated with fomentations, according to this method. Take calamentum, hyssopum, origanum, rutam, sseah, chamomillam, abrotanum, and similar to these herbs: gather all those things or some of them in a pot, and submerge with vinegar, and boil; the pot should be cleaned properly with dirt: there is a hole atop the middle of the pot's opening, upon which an instrument shall be placed according to this method.
Be made of silver or copper: and the end with a pomegranate is inserted into the sickle's mouth until steam rises to the wound above the tube, until it much covers the wound.
Then repeat many times over that same one until healed.
And cut out the swelling before starting treatment for abscesses. It is also pleasing to add in an abscess: it is not necessary to do so unless during the descent of the boil, when it is hot.
But if this instrument is not present with you, then take a cane and prepare its core at the end: so that the patient's skin may not burn; for the core prevents the steam from burning the skin: and this is part of good treatment for health.
§ On removing spines, and bones in the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often it clings to the throat: a fishbone or something else.
Therefore you should extract what appears above that which has fallen: after pressing the tongue with an instrument towards the light, and it is explained to you what is in the throard.
And that which does not appear to you and hides in the throat, it is necessary for a sick person to vomit before food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps something attached will come out through vomiting.
Or a sick person may swallow the end of a pine cone, or the root of lettuce, or a grain of dry bread; or receive the end of sea sponge soaked in milk: and wrap it with woollen thread, then let him swallow the substance. When therefore it reaches the place where there are bones or a bone, and is extracted, then it goes out.
If however it does not go out with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead in this shape.
It should be thicker than a little radius, and at the end there should be flexibility that may easily enter its throat: and it itself has an upwardly polished head.
And let it be noted by touch of its epiglottis, that no cough may happen to him: and push the bone or spine or insert it with the doctor's hand itself.
But indeed the sick person inserts it [the catheter], and this is better: because of his own knowledge about the place annexed to the body; and he pushes downward or pulls up with his hand along with the instrument until fully prepared, then exits.
Concerning the removal of leeches [bloodsuckers].
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is being treated with what I mentioned in the division of cure along with medicines, and it does not grow [bloodsuck], then consider whether to have its throat examined by daylight in front of the sun, or under the sun after having pressed its tongue with an instrument that you are familiar with.
But if your intuition falls on the leech, remove it with a small hook or with delicate fingers properly positioned.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the back of the throat; then insert iron heated by fire into the hollowness of the tune. Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then receive a full utensil of cold water and open his mouth into it: and wash his own mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another by hand. For the leech then falls immediately when it feels water.
But if it does not exit with what I have said, then fumigate the patient with fleas or with vinegar using an instrument that you are familiar with in the smoking of a woolen garment.
Do this many times, for it is indeed that it falls.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot where there are green plums with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, having an opening in the middle: and insert the end of the instrument into that opening.
Then make the person take a suffocation bath and place his sick bone at the tip of the tube, and close his bone so that the suffocation does not escape, until you know that the suffocation has reached the leech. Immediamo che il sanguisughe cadesse immediatamente.
Se questo non cade, allora ripeti la suffumigazione molte volte.
E sopporti il malato sete e mangi pasti salati, aglio e non beva acqua.
Pertanto, è necessario che si esca da questo trattamento.
Ecco la tecnica con lo strumento per estrarre il sangue della lebbra quando cade sopra l'orecchio stesso. (Si noti che questo si riferisce probabilamo a un metodo descritto nel contesto, non necessariamente alla sanguisuga come animale
È simile a un paio di pinzette che vedi: se non è stato inserito in modo tale da entrare nella laringe. (Si nota il riferimento alle forcine utilizzate per attaccare la lebbra al bordo della gola, come descritto nel testo originale.) E la sua estremità è come l'ali di una cicogna che ha un bordo ruvido dove si lega e non lascia mai nulla all'interno. (Si noti il riferimento alle pinzette con le punte ritorte, descritte nel contesto.)
§ Su come tagliare un ascesso, la sua sezione e trattamento generale. (Si noti che l'apostema qui si riferisce probabilmente ad una raccolta di pus o
Testa 40. (Si tratta di numer
Esistono molte specie di ascessi, di molti tipi, come la nostra memoria ricorda loro; E sono diversi nei metodi della loro perforazione e nella sezione dei medesimi in due modi: (Il testo qui si riferisce alle varietà di ascessi descritte nel contesto.)
Di questi un tipo è una forma specifica di ascesso che deriva dalle umidità: (Si nota il riferimento al tipico crescita dell'ascesso dovuta alla presenza di fluidi corporei in eccesso.)
And the second method depends on the places where it occurs from the body.
Since a sore occurrcuing on the head is different from a sore occuring in the anus; and a sore occurrecing at a fleshy place, is different from a sore occurring at joints: each has their own judgement according to its operation.
And from sores are those which should not be perforated unless after the sweating of pus in them and their completion; and among these are those which should be perforated, while they are raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Like sores that are near joints.
For a sore that occurs near a joint and is prolonged to be like its own; until it rots, which may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint connection: thus it is a closer cause for the contraction of that limb part.
Or it is a sore on the main limb part; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that, or through that main limb part.
Or it is near the anus; therefore its perforation should be immature: and it should not be perforated, a raw sore, not fully digested, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deep and prolongs to the intestines within, and becomes a fistula, or occurs on its border which cannot heal.
It is necessary for you to know the time of perforation of sores that are matured according to their completion: and it occurs at the easing of pain, reduction of fever, diminishing redness, weakening pulse, and lessening severity of headaches from sores; and other signs.
And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of sores, and more prominent; and let the perforation be descending along the body, if the sores are on parts of hands and feet, limbs' ligaments, nerves, arteries, and ultimately in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those cases that require reflection, proceed with puncturing according to the aforementanguished limb.
When an abscess is located in fleshy areas: then it is better to delay the puncturing of that one until its digestion has been confirmed, as we mentioned with regard to suppuration.
For if you puncture the thing before that: the course of the virus is extended from it, and there are many impurities and discharges, and perhaps its lips harden, and its depths.
And some abscesses are punctured according to the width of the body out of necessity: or according to that which requires it of limb.
And it is necessary that you administer a slight puncturing in small abscesses, and an ample puncturing in large abscesses: or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
And there are from abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be chiseled away: and when it has been cut like cloth, and done up on its edge, which already has died: as that happens in many, where it becomes soft, and swellings.
And there are from them that have sections with three angles. And there is one of which it becomes like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an abscess in the groin.
And there are from them that a round puncturing is administered, and a crescent-shaped one: and similar to those of the sections.
However, that which does not have a head, such as shallow abscesseras, it is necessary to puncture with a surface puncturing, or merely flat ones.
And it is necessary that when an abscess is large and has already collected many healings, and you have punctured its contents, so that you do not withdraw all the pus at once during that time: indeed extract from that very part of it. Then [let] a soft lump from an abscess persist for another day. Then let something be drawn out of the pus again.
Do that many times gradually, until it is expelled out: especially if the patient is weak due to lack of strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man with gray hair: for often the spirit of the living animal is resolved by the passing away from the sickness. And perhaps the weak person dies and you do not notice it.
Therefore take this chapter with great caution.
And after your incision, which you make in such abscesses, it should be cleaned to prevent wound; and consider this. If therefore there is a small wound from an abscess, or it is a flat incision, then apply Licinius' liniment, or the ancient lotion of Cotton. And if it is a large abscess, and there are many fissures from the incision, then let you insert Licinium into every fissure until they reach closure.
And if in the abscess you have detached part of the skin or pushed it around its edge: then let you fill it with the old Cotton, or as when a cloth is woven, or when lint is carded without moisture: and bind that firmly until on the third day.
Then lay it out, and treat it with what you need from an ointnent, until healed.
But if however a flow of blood happens during your time of operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked into the cloths: and place it many times over the place of the blood flow.
But if the blood flow persists, then it is necessary to administer a regime and treatment, and powders as described in many places of this book, and division.
However, if it is during the winter season and the location of the swelling involves many nerves: then one should pour warm vinegar and hot oil into droplets and place them on top of that spot.
And if it is during the summer and the areas are fleshy: then one should place droplets soaked in water, oil, or a mixture of wine and oil, and all that cold substance. Until the third day, as we said, then one should dissolve the swelling and cleanse the wound, and administer to its healing whatever is suitable for it, until it heals.
This therefore is what is necessary from knowledge of universal treatment for swelling.
According to the aforementioned method of classification, I have already said about every kind of swelling, how it is directed towards its healing chapter by chapter.
Head XLI.
Of cutting out swelling that occurs on the skin of the head.
Swellings on the skin of the head are small and belong to the species of Nodules, which consist of sacs that contain them like little bags of hens' nests.
And there are many kinds of these species.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to scales and scabs; there are others like that, and among them are ones that are stone-hard.
And during the surgery on all of them, there is no fear for their extraction as long as it does not cause disruption to the blood vessels in its cutting process.
And the operation during their extraction is to try them with an instrument whose shape comes after these, which is called an Intrusion, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then dry the extracted part by cutting along its length following the method of the surface cut: according to this shape.
And begin with the cutting from line b to line g; therefore, as moisture is evacuated, then remove the growth that contains this moisture, and do not let anything be left in it thoroughly.
For often times it returns if something remains from there.
Then immerse the cautery in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt; then fill with it the wound, and let it remain until another day. For indeed it consumes what remains from the growth.
Then repeat over the cautery with Egyptian ointment a second and third time; and if you see that it has not left anything from the growth, then care for the wound with ointment until healed.
If the abscess contains a pus node: then dry it following this form; having the shape of a cross for cutting: and project the little hooks between the bone ends, and remove it from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the envelope that contains it.
But if however an obstruction is made for you by the vessel, then do what I will tell you to do afterward.
And similarly proceed with an abscess if it is a stone: by cutting and the same care as we have said.
And the cutting over the abscess of a stone is easier: because there are few blood and moisture. And sometimes these types of abscesses are located on the head of some men, with whom there is no moisture at all.
That is: because I have cut over an abscess on the head of a bald woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if it were struck with something being thrown at it by someone else, it would wound itself.
In other cases of boils and such occurrences on the head, besides these apostemas that occur in children' cups, and near the roots of ears, a superficial section should be performed for all of them.
Or place a puncture on their always from the lower part of them, so that the course of pus may be relieved towards the bottom.
Then attend to it with what suits them in accordance with its treatment.
§ On cutting of Strophulae on the neck.
Head XLII.
Often these boils occur on the neck and under arms, and groins, and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And on top of these that occur on the neck, there are few and many: and they originate from sweat; and all Strophulae come from them within their own tunic, just as it is in nodes and boils of the head, as I have told you.
And there are many kinds of these Strophulae. For from them indeed there are stones; and there are those that contain moisture; and there are harmful ones, which do not obey treatment.
In this kind then that you see of good arrangement by touch, which is evident by the close color of skin, and it moves to all parts, and it is not joined with collar nerves, nor with jugular veins, nor with arteries, nor deep: one must cut it off with a superficial section from upper part downward toward lower part of body along line b. to line g., and pick out its skin edge by edging all around; or extend two lips of skin with hooks or many hooks if you find such thing as we said in head boils, and gradually extract it.
And it is to be observed carefully not to injure the vein, nor nerve.
And it is a place not very sharp: so that it does not give you hand pain when making an incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut only what is necessary.
However, if you fall and injure an artery or the wound is closed off from surgery, then place ground zigaretto (incense) or certain powders that stop blood flow into the wound, tighten the wound, and release it, until the swelling of pus subsides and the wound softens; or if it begins to start turning putrid.
Therefore, blood is stopped using a tourniquet from Robertus, so that you may finish your surgery.
Then examine with your index finger if anything remains from the staples or other materials: so cut them out and cleanse them.
If there is a large opening in the root of the staple: then it must not be cut from its own roots: rather it should be lightly loosested with a double strong thread and released so that it falls off on its own without harm.
Then fill the wound completely with an old ointnent of Egypt which you have already submerged. Then take care of it. (Note: This instruction is
If the entire staple is cut, then it must be gathered with two wound lips: and wash it immediately after seeing that nothing remains overabundant. (Note: This instruction assumes familiarity with ancient surgical procedures involving staples.)
However, if you see that there remains an overabundance because of the size of the stapletechnology, then it must be tightened to cut its roots and extract it: and apply the suture as we mentioned before. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical techniques involving sutures.)
And what contains moisture from the staple should be punctured with a superficial perforation so that its healing place appears to you: and place the perforation below where it follows on the body as we said. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical practices involving the management of wound moisture.)
Then administer liniment with ointment, and similar substances, to warm what remains from the decay until when you see that the wound is already cleaned: then take care of it with a regenerating ointment for the flesh, until it heals. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical practices involving post-perforation treatments.)
Chapter 43.
§ On cutting the epiglottis due to an obstruction within the throat.
The ancients have said that this incision was made on the epiglaturm, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their writing style.
However, in those with a tension pneumothorax, it is necessary that an incision be made on the epiglottis; because if this does not occur, then respiration cannot take place: therefore, because all vessels and lungs are sick.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it should be used to make an incision on the epiglottis, to avoid destruction that occurs from perforation.
Therefore, when we wish to do that incision on the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, a small cut perpendicular in width, between two circles for as much quantity as there is an incision in flesh and not cartilage: this place itself is suitable for cutting because it is devoid of fatty tissue, and vessels of blood are far from that area.
But if the physician is hesitant, then they should stretch out the skin of the throat with a hook. Then strike the skin until it reaches the canal; let out some blood vessels if you see anything coming from them.
Then cut the flesh as we have mentioned; and it signifies above the cutting of the canal from mucus that emerges from there, when something breaks off, and a cough is expelled.
And release an open wound after some time.
But when the hour is removed from which he fears perforation, bring together two lips of a skin wound and its own alone without cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow; until it is healed.
Said Albuccian. The sum of the tale we have told is not an explanation unless when they see that some of these boils have already closed up in the patient's throat: and the sick man rises above death, and wishes to cut off his breathing; so they come to cutting out the epiglottis, as for him to breathe upon the wound site, and is healed from death: and therefore it was prescribed to let open sores be removed until the malice of the sickness consumes completely, and its malevolence lasts three days or so; then they ordered to sew up the wound, and take care of it until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself is that a maid took hold of a knife and thrust it into her own throat, and wounded herself with its edge.
And I was called to heal hers, and found her moaning as the cry of the dead is.
Therefore from the wound I dissected it, and found blood that had come out through the wound. Therefore I was confused because she did not faint nor vomit: and a breath of air came out from the ward.
So I cared for the wound and treated it until healed; and nothing befell to the maid except a rasping voice: and she returned after days to better condition of her own.
Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting out an epiglottis.
¶ On the incision of a hernia in the throat.
Chapter 44.
This hernia of the throat called 'Aposthoma' is a large boil according to the body's color: and it occurs frequently among women.
And it is in two ways: for it may be natural or accidental.
Certainerly, it cannot be an artifice naturally.
However, in the other way accidental, there are two kinds: one is like a node of pine cones. And another kind is like an embolism that occurs due to vascatury. And in it is fear, and one should not make a conjecture about this with iron unless in what is small; and you test the thing yourself, and investigate it by insertion. If therefore you find it like a node of pine cones and is not hanging with any vessels: then cut out the thing as they do nodes: and extract it along with whatever contains from the sack, if it is in the sack; and if not, then examine its entirety. Then attend to the place as required for healing until it heals.
Chapter XLV.
¶ On cutting according to types of nodes. (This is not a translation instruction but part of the original text or
There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already described all the kinds thereof in division: and it is necessary that I narrate herein a distinction between Node, and Embolism: since it creates doubt. (This text snippet doesn't contain instructions but rather appears to be part of an original work.)
Therefore I say that when an Embolism is heat and fever and intense pains until the overflow of excess fluid subsides and putrefaction completes: then indeed the fevers calm down, and warmth subsides. (Again, this appears to be part of a larger work.)
However when a Node is not heat nor fever nor pains, and it contains those sacs called siphachae, which are their own sacs according to the color of the body: and they arise suddenly like beans, and come forth like fennel, bigger and smaller ones. (Once more, part of a larger document.)
And there are two kinds: fatty or containing moisture. (This is also not an instruction but text from the original work.) And there are many colors due to moisture, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of the Node, you must examine it and ask about its form first with the instrument called Intromissum, as described in the chapter that follows this one.
And the method of inquiring about swellings and all nodes is to receive this instrument, insert it into a wetter place you find in the swelling: and gradually retract your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then use your last finger according to the size of the swellings.
Next, remove the Intromebium and examine what comes out on its indication.
If then there runs a moisture, whatever the color is: then dry it with a cut that is superfebrile, as I said in other swellings.
And if there does not come out moisture in the indication of Intromissum, then know it is fatty: therefore dry above it with a cut that has a cross shape, according to this form as I taught you: and hang it with an unguentarium, and excoriate the skin from all sides easily: and if you can keep something on top of that, guard it with a kestros, so as to extract the healthy Node.
If however the unguentarium is broken during surgery, and it is not possible to extract it fully, because this often happens with that: then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if something still remains from it a little or much, the Node returns greatly.
But if it overcomes you and a little still remains from it: then fill the wound near your completion with some sharp abrasive powders: and bind the wound, and place on top of that which sits in hot swelling, and care for it as per the remaining treatment until healed.
If there is a large knot, then tie its two lips and care for it as it becomes inflamed.
But if the blood vessel is pulsing or not: then hurry, and fill in the place with a pounded lint, and release it tightly for two days or three, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood ceases: then return to cutting off what remains from the knot.
Chapter 46.
§ Of external instruments for cutting and piercing.
There are forms of probes; and they are three kinds.
For from them there is a large one, and from them there is a medium one, and from them there is a small one.
Let them be made of iron rectangular ends askew, so that they enter quickly into the extremities.
And these are forms of experients (probes), and not piercers; that is, perforators: and one of their names is called a berr, that is, a perforator: and they are three kinds.
For from them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are fitted to be used for investigating through the extremities, and excised tissues, and fistulas, and boils arising between them from bone fragments.
And they are also made round, pointed, and blunt, as with large needles that follow the seats (beds), such as from amber indeed, or from copper, iron, or silver.
And their better ones are those made of amber.
And they are also made of black lead and used for investigating the fistulas whose refluxes (outflows) are mirror-like, which with their own smoothness cause reflection in harmony with those refluxe.
And again they are three kinds. For from them there are long ones, and medium ones, and short ones, according to the amplitude of the fistulas and stricture (narrowing) it has.
The shape of cuts, and there are many kinds.
Since they are simple ones, namely those with a single passage: and there are three kinds as you see them - Great, Middle, and Small.
And among them are blind cuts, and there are three kinds.
And among them are hooks with two passages and there are three kinds; and those are hooks with three passages and there are three kinds as well; and all of these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels by which nodes and boils are cut and scraped; and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
Their pointed ends are those with which cutting is done; the other ends are not sharp. And they do not have such shapes, unless for providing comfort during boil scraping when there is fear of a cut on the vein or nerve, and that it may be healed through them in cases where only slight burning was found to provide relief at the time of nodule scrapeing.
They are made of iron, and they resemble an earthenware pipe with which alcohol is drawn; there is a small hole at the wider end hidden by Spatulae (surgical spreaders); and into it flows towards the interior or exterior depending on whether it's used as seen.
The shape of the spreaders hidden between fingers during boil puncturing; and they are not felt by patients: and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
The form of the blood vessel cutters with which bleeding flow is severed; and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
They should be made of copper or gold, round mostly in length as seen; and they are subtle.
And it should be that there are these types of tourniquets with you, large and small; so as to use them for cutting off blood quickly when necessary, and then when no medicine is present.
However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every body part; and only use them on fleshly places: such as the shanks of legs, hips, arms' shoulders, breasts, winds, groins, and similar to these from fleshy parts, moist.
And sometimes tools are made from them similar to cups of fistulae; which cuts off blood when it flows out of a wound or during an incision of veins, arteries: and at times there are made from them spherical ones according to this shape.
Chapter LXXVII.
§ On the healing of human breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Sometimes breasts of some people are inflamed during the completion of sleep (that is, when they start to become sweaty during sleep): and remain with unsightly pustules.
But if one dislikes this, he should cut over the breasts using a crescent-shaped incision according to this method from point b, to point g: then remove all the swelling. Then fill the wound with carnivorous medicine. And then gather two lips of the wound together with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
But if it bends downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it should be cut in two of its upper sides at the same shape of a crescent-shaped incision, one of which contains the other on each side until the larger line encloses the smaller according to this method from point b, to point g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips and take away the swelling, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
However, if you cannot close the incision as it should be cut due to the patient'amoor or because of bleeding: then you must fill the wound with soaked cotton in a corrosive ointment and let it rest until that which remains from the swelling dries. Then care for it until it heals.
Regarding the puncture of abscesses that occurs under a boil.
Chapter 48.
These abscesses that occur under a boil are of the species called Strophulae, which contain bile and consist of them, and they are those containing moisture.
These therefore that contain moisture should be dried out with a crescent-shaped incision according to this pattern, from line b to line g, so that all the pus in the abscess is drained because of the discharge, then fill it with old cotton and let it rest until another day.
Then remove the cotton, and care for it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is of the species called Nodes of Strophulae, then cut over it as we have said in the incision above the Strophulae equally.
However, if the wound extends to such an extent that it discharges pus, then apply a caustic agent there as we have said in what was mentioned earlier.
Chapter 49.
Regarding the incision of abscessamoor that occurs due to an artery and vein.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin that is over it hardens, this often leads to abscesses from there: similarly, with veins as well, such things happen with abscesses and swelling.
And the signs by which one knows that abscesses and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are as follows: for when an abscess is because of an artery, it is long, clustered deep in the body; and when you push on an abscess with your fingers, you feel almost like there's a hissing sound.
And what is related to veins is round within the open body.
And a section over this abscess is an error, especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many body places; and it is very large indeed. Therefore, its care must be directed with iron, and what is also from it in the extremities or head should be treated accordingly.
Over this therefore from them arises due to an inflammamoent of the Artery's opening, it is found with a cut lengthwise into the skin. Then open with hooks, afterwards the artery itself; and free it from the tunics until revealed.
Then introduce under it a hook and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the artery with a thread twice at two places, as I taught you in extracting the two arteries that are on the temples.
Then strike the place between the two ligaments with a pincers until all blood that is within it flows out and the abscess dissolves.
Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall; afterwards care for it with suitable ointments to that end when healed.
If the abscess is from a vein incision, then it must be held by your hand as much as possible away with skin. Then insert a hook under the place you have held with your hand and make it penetrate; and be there a thread twice until extracted from the other side. Then bind with the very abscess itself a good ligament: as I told you on the vein of two parts with two extremities thread.
But if the thread that is extracted a hook, then insert another with another thread under the abscess entirely at the incision of the needle: press and bind your threads in four places.
Then he cauterizes the abscess in its center until it protrudes; then incise the excess skin, and remove what is tied there.
Then place on top of that swelling which you have immersed in wine, and oil. Then administer the treatment with licorice and ointments until it heals.
Head L.
§ About an abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
As it happens with an abscess in the Artery and Vein, similarly occurs with an abspect in Nerves: what happens to them is a blow, or from excessive labor, and similar causes: and they happen much more often at places of assistance, or heels, and in every place where they move joints: and it is a grave abscess.
It resembles the color of other parts of the body, and it is found without pain in various dispositions: and when it tightens with great force, it feels weak like a state of stupor.
And it is not an abscess accumulated deep within the body; rather, it is under the skin and moves to all parts of it without advancing forward or backward.
Therefore, when occurring at joints, one does not need it to advance with iron (scalpel). Perhaps there is a contraction.
However, that which occurs at the head or forehead, has skin with pus-like substance. If it is an abscess of glands, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape off the abscess; next remove the piece, and bind the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
Head LI.
§ About cutting an abscess that occurs at the genitalia.
Certain very men often suffer from afflictions in their sinews and in other parts of their bodies, called thrushes, which are similar to mushrooms.
The root is thin, the head is thick, and they turn over the lips of those who have them. And there are two kinds among them: one that is greatly esteemed.
And I myself have already seen men who had two thrushes that were more like other fungi: there was no difference between them; they were white and minute at the root, and turned over their lips, burst open, and always released moisture from within.
Therefore, I have cut into them, and found that one weighed about X pounds and VIII unciae (ounces), and the other VI unciae; thus consider: if the patient is moist and the thrushes are white, thin at the root, then you should incise it with a rather wide spatula, while there is caution in the fire.
For often much blood is expelled during its sectioning; so be quick if your own blood overcomes you, then burn it with caution.
If you see a patient who is cowardly and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead properly formed, and tie it around the thrushes; as we have said before, let go of them after two days.
Then add to the lead string. (Note: The translation is complete, but this sentence seems incomplete or out of context Therefore do not cease to hold the lead string whenever it imprints on thrushes, until it separates and falls off naturally without effort.
However, if there are thrushein large at the root, then there is something of fear and cowardice during its incision: especially because it's located inside a vein. (Note: The context may suggest that the size or location increases the difficulty or danger of treatment)
However, it is possible to sever half of it. Then cauterize its body so that it does not return.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
And be careful not to assume you are cutting something that is of a darker color, with few sensations and unpleasant appearance: for it is indeed an abscessed cancerous tumor; and I remember the treatment given by Cancer after this.
Chapter LII.
Regarding the treatment of enlargements at the navel.
The enlargement at the navel is due to many causes. Or from fissures of the diaphrage, which is above the abdomen: and it comes out as a result of this through wind or bowels, just as happens with other ruptures. Or from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, as previously mentioned. Or from wind being trapped there.
If however it is due to a diaphragmatic rupture and wind discharge: then it has the color similar to that of the body: and it is bloody without pain: and appears in various places. And if it is due to bowel discharge, then the location of its release is more intense in variety as we have narrated. When therefore you press it with your fingers, it hides: then it returns and there may be a sound associated with it: and it is greatly magnified at the bath entrance, causing painful swelling.
If however it is due to moisture, then it is bloody and does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor tighten or swell.
If however it is due to blood, then these signs appear as an abscess turning black at the edge.
And if however it is due to new flesh: then it is a serious abscess, large and hard, growing according to the amount of one.
If indeed it is due to windiness, then its touch is gentle.
And the operation on that is such that then you must consider if there is prominence of the navel due to artery blood, or vein, or windiness; then it should be avoided from healing. For there is fear and trembling, as I taught you in the chapter where I said stasis due to an artery and vein.
But if there is prominence of the navel due to the bowels or wind: then one should instruct the sick person to keep their breathing steady and stand upright extendedly. Then signs with warm wax around the entire navel. Afterwards instruct it to lie between your hands over its back. Then surround with a wide bandage around the navel above the place where you marked it with hot wax. Then extend medium stasis upwardly, with a large hook. Then bind it around the navel with a strong thread or string from silk cord and make knots at the end of the tensioned ligament.
Then open up the extended stasis above the ligament. But if you find it already detached from the ligament: then extract the stasis and insert into the index finger, and push the intestine towards the interior of the bowels: and if you encounter wind, then take the content with a large hook, and cut away any excess.
But if it is opposite to you an artery or vein: then surround that much. Then come back to your operation. And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two neede
Then bind the stasis at four places over the needles: and if you can, remove the needle, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots away: and it falls off by itself: or cut out when softened and rotted.
Then care for it with what is needed using ointments until it heals.
If the prominence of the navel is from a flesh wound or moisture: then it should be cauterized as we have said. And extract any blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then care for it with what is needed to strengthen the place.
Chapter LIII. (Latin III = three, so
On treating cancer.
Now we have mentioned the division of cancer types and how to treat them with medicines; also it should be treated from there using iron so that it does not ulcerate; and we have discussed cancers originating in the uterus, and the precautions for tren.
And the ancients have said that sometimes cancer is located where it can be completely removed: such as cancer in the nipples or thighs and similar cases, from body parts to be extracted entirely; especially when small.
But when it is large and has been eradicated, one should not approach close to it.
For I have not been able to cure any of them: nor have I seen anyone before me who has come to that.
And the operation on it, when located as we have mentioned, is to precede and dissolve weakness by means of a black bile several times. Then use leeches if you find them with obvious swelling.
Then prepare the patient for treatment, where it is located with surgery.
Then throw out the hooks that are attached to it. Then cauterize it from all sides with a scalpel, according to examination until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow out, and do not cut it quickly, rather press on spots, and cleanse away thick blood completely by hand or as much as possible there with tools.
However, if bleeding prevents you due to a swoleblood from an incision of the artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood separates. Then take care of it with the remaining treatment until healed.
Regarding the treatment for Hydrops.
Chapter LIV. Now we have narrated the division of Hydrops and how water accumulamoins form; and signs of every type, as well as its treatment with drugs.
And those that are treated with iron are only of the type ascites alone; and they do not approach types of tympanitis nor hyposarcia completely, for these are deadly.
When you have already treated this type of tympanitis with drugs and the treatment has not succeeded: then consider. For if weakness has already settled in him or there is another ailment besides Hydrops, such as coughing or sputum dissolution and similar conditions: then do not treat with iron, for that fear exists.
But if you see a patient with an excess of strength and there is no other illness besides Hydrops alone: and it is neither a boy nor an old person: then the method of operation in him is, as you elevate the patient standing between your hands, and have someone behind them express their phlegm by thrusting water onto the lower part of their chest with his hand.
Then take a large thorn, as follows this shape: (Here you would describe how to prepare and use the 'large thwart' in context). Let it have two sharp parts, be long and with pointed tips like Thwart (This is an instruction about forming a tool similar to the 'thwart' described previously). However, ensure it has some gradual width in it so that you do not penetrate too deeply during the operation until the intestines and injure him.
Then carefully examine. If the hydropisis generation is from a part of the intestines, then it should be extended with an incision at the navel to a length equaling three digits and directed downwards above the sternum.
However, if the hydropisis generation is due to liver illness: then your incision on the left should be from the navel measuring three digits.
And if that generation is due to the spleen: then your incision on the right side should be made: and it does not even need an incision above which the patient wishes to lie weak, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Then pierce with a tool through all skin. Then insert into that incision and moisten your hand with spatulilin between skin, and spread; as if you were scrape it off: and the amount that should be scraped is an amount of a fingernail, or about so much.
Then pierce with spatulilin until it reaches the vacuum space; and that is a place of water. Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form. And it is like cannulas: made of silver or iron or copper, smooth and thin: on its lower part there are two holes, and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other; and its tip end is cut as you see in the incision model, like a pen's nib: at its upper extremity there is an armlet.
For when the instrument reaches water, it immediately descends on top of the instrument; therefore purify half an hour'vee amount from water.
For if you purify too much from it within an hour, perhaps the patient will die through a dissolution of his own body's spirits; or he has a fainting which approaches death.
Indeed, I will use it according to the quantity of its potency, and as you instruct regarding the dispositions of sickness from its potency, and by its goodness.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that retains the hole that is above the shaft; as you described, puncture it according to this method.
Then repeat with a different instrument if you see the patient can endure that; and also extract a small amount from water.
Do this for several days without fear, and protect yourself from error: until there is very little left in the water.
If however you have applied it to the sick person several times, and removed much from water; then care for him with a warm sand bath and profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and wait over thirst: and care for him with purgative medicines until he is cured: and burn (the potion) on the stomach, liver, and spleen, after extracting water; as you described what was done before.
About caring for infants born in places where their urine is not pierced.
Chapter LV.
When someone is born from the womb of a mother and his head is not pierced, or it has a tight hole, or it is located elsewhere than its usual place.
Therefore, one must intervene immediately at birth with a very fine sponge bath according to this method.
Then place a very fine instrument made of lead in the nostrils and tie it off; and hold it for three or four days.
Whenever he wishes to pass urine, remove (the instruments) and let him drink. Then reduce the swelling.
And if you cannot use lead now, it is also possible that the urine flowing over the spot does not allow closure of it.
However, if the opening is tight, it should be treated with lead, as we have said, over many days until it is enlargamo.
But those in which there is an opening not in its proper place are damaged. Because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the female body part, so it cannot penetrate towards the front until it has moved itself upwards by hand. Nor is there generation for this reason, because semen cannot reach the womb in straightness; and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of procedure in that case is to lie down the sick person on his back. Then extend with your left hand the head of that female body part with a vigorous stretching and cut at the top of the male head from its place of protrusion, sharply or slightly acutely; as is incision of reed, or as you have split something in half, so that it comes out like the middle of the head of the female body part: and let the opening fall to the center according to what ought.
And take care with your operation from bleeding. Oftentnises it happens so. Therefore apply to him what he has cut with blood and treat the wound until it is healed.
§ Concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the female body part, and decay, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 66.
Oftnies these things happen to the female body part, and it is a prominent foulness of flesh.
And one other thing is very bad, and another not very bad.
Not therefore the non-very-bad must be held with a slender hook, and cut it off until you have removed all of it. Then place over it a pad soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for it afterward with dafinion ointment until healed.
If the tumor is malignant and discolored, then you must apply cautery after its incision and cutting.
However, if the albater is within the foreskin of a captus who has not been circumcuted and it is part Albather between the foreskin and outside: then you must remove Albather first inside, until consolidated, then care for it from the outside; because when you cure them at once, there will be no precaution so that the foreskin does not become foreshortened.
And now also occur in the testicles and blackness of the foreskin and decay. Therefore, you must cauterize all that has turned black and what you wish to be decayed or already is decaying.
Then a line on top of it afterward with honey that has been mixed with ground-up meal and pounded herbs.
Then care for that with the remaining treatment until healed.
But if there is a bleeding flow, then you must apply cautery with moon-cauter, according to this method.
For the cautery is a remedy for both conditions at once, namely bleeding and wounds when they are corrupting.
If the head of a woman is corroded and destroyed all at once: then you must insert into the man's urethra a tube made of lead, so that the sick person may drip over it.
However, if there is adhesion of the foreskin with the head of a woman, and indeed this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy, and it does not require super circumcision: and sometimes it occurs because of wounds or abscesses; you must therefore remove that with an obtuse spatulum until the ligament dissolves, and releases the head of a woman from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them clearly, then one must shave off something from the maiden'ader and the foreskin. Because when the prepuce is delicate, it may be pierced due to its own subtlety quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the maiden with a fine linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water so that they do not stick again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it hardens.
Chapter LVII.
Regarding the cleanliness of infants and treatment due to accidents.
Circumcision is not the solution to continence, as are other wounds: however, since it comes from our work, our will, and its use being proper for boys, we must mark this operation as better, and a lighter way leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use them according to laws and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Because I have found a greater part of the art to use phlebotomists for cleanliness, circumcision with scissors and forceps: they are used as well by those who bind tightly with thread, and cut with a nail.
And I myself have already tested all those methods, and I have not found a better cleansing with forceps and binding with thread.
For cleanlineby using scissors, the skin often flees. For the prepuce has two layers of skin: therefore perhaps the upper skin is pierced and the lower layer remains; it is thought that there should be a cut to injure one of them and cause pain. And with cleanliness that is done by binding tightly, that is, with fingers, which surgeons use, there is no secure incision of the extremities of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its hole.
However, in the cleansing of a nail, perhaps iron is used, and it spoils your operation; indeed, the skin of young boys is naturally thin, and they are often born this way so that no cleansing is needed; I have already seen this.
However, in the cleansing of a nail and with a string tied to it, I have successfully conducted an experiment: since the forceps are proportional to the incision, therefore the sharpness that is above is like the sharpnss below. Thus, when you raise your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they incise according to a single operation at one time; it forms a compression of similar shape, containing the skin of the girl from all sides, so that no mistake whatsoever occurs.
And the mode of your operation is to make it extendable, especially for boys if they are from those who understand little, which you do not do unless you tie a string on their skin only; and you let them go until the next day.
Then make him enjoy and rejoice in every possible way for himself; because he receives understanding from it. Then make him stand between your prepared hands according to his stature, and not be seated; and hidden forceps on your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Then insert your hand into her thigh and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the girl's vagina is out. Then cleanse that part with what accumulates therein dirty.
Then tie the marked place twice with a string. Afterward, tie the lower part of the ligament to that extent as well. Then hold it with your index finger, and your thumb retains the lower part of the ligament firmly, and incise between the two ligaments. Then lift the skin quickly upwards and remove the thorny branchlet. Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better so) and place powder from above: and on top of the pownser put linen in which an incubated quail egg has been boiled in rose water, mixed with freshly pressed oil of roses; and lay it over until another day arrivebut care for the rest of the treatment as long as it heals.
However, this is how to cleanse using forceps:
There are two blunt ends and they fit together: do not push the branch out; and the length of both sharp parts should be equal to the length of both handles equally.
However, an error that may occur during cleanscuing is: since the skin's inner part might entirely escape or a part of it near the incision.
Therefore, as you stretch it out from your time with your nail before locating the area: and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it using a hook, and cut it.
However, if three days have passed and there remains what is under the inflamed branchlet, an abscess: then let it rest until the abscess becomes warm, and scrape it off easily, and cut as you prepared for yourself: and cover it from the head of the branchlet with a dressing. For he will not be harmed by that.
Therefore, take care of that with what consolidates a wound from powders, which we have discussed in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut above its measure, and evades to the higher parts, it will not harm him even so.
Therefore, take care of that with what we have discussed, until healed.
Chapter 58.
Regarding the removal of a retained bladder stone:
Chapter 58. Retention of urine in the bladamo, is achieved by making a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or raw meat, and similar things from those we mentioned by methods of treatment in division.
And if it is not relieved and you see that the urine retention is due to a stone already present in the bladder neck: then he should be made weak over his own knees, lying down. Then his feet are placed on his back and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and squeezes inhales as much as possible by him. Therefore, when a stone is thought to be expelled from the bladder neck towards the back: that's why it relieves urine retention.
But if it is not relieved with what we have said and he feels discomfort over the weakened one: then you should administer its extraction by means of an instrument, called a syringe, whose this is the shape It is made of silver, and it is delicate, smooth, hollow as the quill pen's shaft in subtlety: long like the width of one palm; there must be a fine cannula at its head.
And the method of exiting urine by it is as follows: receive a doubled thread at its end and tie with linen or cotton, good ligature; insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; cut with scissors if there's any excess from the thread, truly insert into the cannula forcefully, as you tighten.
Then clean the syringe with oil or butter, and albugine: and make him sit over a stool, and insert into the bladder neck, and wet his urethra with moistened oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert a syringe into the vagina with ease, until it reaches the root of the vagina.
Then take two more on top from the upper part of the navel.
Then insert the syringe into it until it reaches the bladcu; and feel if the patient has already reached an empty space: but this is not done according to this order unless the channel, through which it passes, is twisted as such.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. The vagina will follow the wool.
Then remove it and make the vagina run through the channel of urine; and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
Regarding the quality of cleansing the bladder with a Clepsydra. (Note: In an actual translation task for historical texts, understanding context is crucial; "Clepsydra
Head LIX.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder or blood congeals within it, or pus is blocked inside of it; then a device called Clepshydra is made with instruments as follows:
It is indeed closed, that is to say, sealed. (Note: "surda" in Latin can mean "de And there are three holes in it, two from one part and one from the other side, as you see. (Note: This translation assumes that "sicut" is meant to be a Latin equivalent of "as follows," which may not be contextually accurate but serves for this exercise.)
And the place where this is pushed should be according to the quantity that suits it without addition until when something is drawn out with it from moistures; and when it's driven, it expels it over a distance: just as clepshydra does, which throws off naptha, that is Greek fire in warfare. (Note: "id est" means "that is," indicating further explanation or clarification.)
Therefore, when you want to throw out the fluids into a bag, insert the tip of the siphon into the fluid, and pull along with what propels it upward, for the fluid is drawn into the concavity of the siphon.
Then insert its tip into the wound as we described with the catheter. Then push the fluid along with what is being pushed so that the fluid immediately reaches the bag, as if felt by the patient.
The form of a subtle clyster to cleanse the bladder.
Be made of silver or gold: its head should be high like a small jug and under it there should be an interval where the sling can hang.
Then take the bladder of a ram and place fluid in it, which is to cleanse the bladnary bag with the clyster. Then tie it between two intervals of strong thread and heat that fluid a little above fire.
Then insert the tip of the clyster into the wound and then tighten your hand over the bladder with fluid in a decent knot until the patient feels it, as that fluid has already reached the bladder.
But if it is not present to you a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce its entire roundness. Then insert strong thread into those holes as they open up. Then gather the circle like it is gathered with alms: after you put what you need from that which is made of fluids, and oil, and waters.
Then tie that circle on the instrument as you did with the bladder from an expression using your hand, until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
§ Regarding the extraction of Stone.
Now we have discussed the division of species Lapidis, and its treatment with medicines; and I mentioned the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys, and blad etherium, and the signs thereof: and I mentioned the Stone where surgical operation falls by hand and cutting. And it is a Stone generated specifically in the bladder, and that one which becomes fixed in the urethra; and this is what I am telling with clear exposure and abbreviation.
Therefore, I say that a Stone generated specifically in the bladder happens very often to boys.
And one of its signs is that urine exits from the bladder like water with its subtlety: and appears in it white sand, and the weakened boy rubs his urethra, and labors with it, and often he droops. Then it is raised up, and comes out along with him having many of them. (referring to urinary stones)
And the healing of boys is easy up to where they have reached fourteen years old. And it is difficult for the elderly. (referring to urinary stones) For boys it is moderate, being between the two; and for those whose Stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if smaller, there's a reverse in that care. (referring to urinary stones)
And thus when we arrive at treatment, it is primarily that we cleanse the infirm with an enema, to let out all feces that are within his bowels; because sometimes it prevents a Stone from appearing during examination. (referring to urinary stones)
Then the patient is taken with his legs raised up and moved towards downwards; so that the Stone descends to the depths of the blad etherium or leaps from a high place several times. (referring to urinary stones)
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his coccyx, so that the bladder is fully moved towards downwards. (referring to urinary stones)
Then examine him and touch him from the outside.
Therefore, if you feel a stone inside, act quickly with an incision above it.
If it does not fall at all to your touch, then you should wash the index finger with olive oil from the left hand if he is a sick boy; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth: and insert it into his anus, examine for the stone while under your finger: and slowly turn it towards the navel.
Then press on it with your finger and push the stone towards the outside against its location; instruct a servant to squeeze his scrotum with their hand and instruct another servant to stretch the testicles upwards with their right hand: and with their other hand, remove any skin that is under the testicles near where the incision was made.
Then insert a drainage tube whose shape is as follows. And find it between the anus and testicles, but not in the middle, on the left side of the scrotum: and make sure the incision is above the stone, with your finger inside the anus; and ensure a crosswise incision that is wider externally and tighter internally, according to as much egress of the stone from there is possible without being too large.
For perhaps by compressing the finger that is inside the anamen near the incision, the stone comes out easily.
And know that from the stone are angles and edges, which is why its exit is difficult due to this.
And from it is a soft substance, similar to a glandular tissue, and round: and therefore its exit is easy.
Therefore, since it has angles and edges, insert it into the crevice.
If it does not come out this way, then you should apply leverage on top of it; or place strings over it with a proper arrangement such that their ends are like the moon cradling the stone and do not move away from it: or insert a delicate instrument underneath it with curved tips.
If however you cannot go over it, then slightly enlarge the opening. But if something defeats you from the blood, separate it with a scalpel.
But if the stone is larger than one, then push into the first large urinary bladebreach. Then incise above it. Afterwards push with small blades after that one: and similarly, if there are several ones, do so with two blades.
For if it is very large, then be ignorant to cut over it in a big section. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices) For because it happened to a sick person in the place of two things, either that he dies or an ongoing frequent excretion of urine occurs; therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all. (This sentence seems incorrect or poore translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
But provide him with an evacuation until he comes out; or use your skills on his breakage with pincers, until you gradually get it out of him. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Whenever you have completed your operation, then apply thorn dressing, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bandage it, and place soaked cloth over it with oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water: to cool down the swelling. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
Then place a sick person upside-down on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices) Whenever you loosen it, emboss the place with much water and oil. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Then care for it with the ointment of dafinon, and the ointment of basilico, until he is cured. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
But if this happens to a swelling with heat added, and rotten, and such things: as if the blood freezes in the bladder, and it is prevented from flowing out of that urine: and one recognizes that by an excretion of blood mixed with urine. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices) Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract blood from it. If it remains, it causes decay of the bladcuo and its putrefaction.
Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all kinds of things suitable to its treatment until it heals.
And during the entire course of treatment, one must apply two compresses and bandages, according to the medical remedies prescribed for that area.
If the stone is small and it's lodged in a male duct, and stuck therein, preventing urine discharge: then treat it with whatever I described before you reach for surgery. For often one is freed from the necessity of surgery through this treatment, which I have already tested.
And you are to obtain a Perforator from iron alfie, which has the following form: triangular at its end, sharp and fixed on wood.
Then take a thread and tie it with the male duct so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the Perforator into the male duct with ease until it reaches the stone; and withdraw the Perforatar manually from the same stone gradually: and ascertain the perforation of it until you make the stone pass through the other part.
For then, urine is immediately released.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone from the external part of the male duct. For it breaks and comes out with urine, and cures the sick person.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it from the stone: then tie a thread underneodefinitely, and another thread over the stone. Then dry over the male duct between the two threads. Then remove it. Afterwards dissolve the bandage and cleanse the frozen blood which forms on the wound.
And it is not necessary to place a thread under the stone unless to prevent returning to the blister: and another bandage from above, so that when the string unties after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound as we mentioned: therefore you must do this when tying the thread from above, to lift up the skin towards the top, so it aligns with your closure, and cover the w지.
Chapter LXI.
Regarding the removal of stones in women.
Little stone is formed in women.
But if this happens to someone of them, the treatment is difficult and forbidden for various reasons.
One of them is: that woman may perhaps be a virgin. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'uirgo' means widow rather than virgin in
And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste or married. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'casta' should be translated as chaste/pure rather than married.)
The third is because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation by hand. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'manu' should be translated as manually or by hand rather than just by hand.)
And the fourth is the distance of the stone's location: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear involved. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'indiget' should be translated as needs or requires rather than just requires.)
Because if necessity prompts you to do so, then it is necessary that you accept a woman as your doctor who is well-versed: and few are found. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'parum' should be translated as fewer or not many rather than just few.)
But if you are to abandon her, then look for a chaste, skilled and present obstetrician well-versed in the matter of women, or a woman who has innovated in this art: do so with her at hand, especially that she does everything you prescribe from your inquiry about the stone. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'praecipue' should be translated as particularly rather than just especially.)
Firstly, what must be done is that he looks to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
But if he finds it, he should restrain it with his own finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's weak vagina and feel for a stone after she places her left hand over the urinary tract, and compresses (it) with good compression.
But if he finds the stone, then it is necessary for him to gradually move it from the opening of the urinary tract towards the lower regions with great strength until it reaches as far down to the hip bone.
Then he shall cut above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the hip bone from whatever side is prepared for him, and feels the stone there: and his finger should not be moved away from the stone, restraining under it: and (the operation) be a small one first. Then he shall insert the probe over that incision.
Then he shall insert the probe over that incision. But if he feels the stone then he should add to the incision a second one of proportional size as that by which the stone emerges from her.
And know that there are many kinds of stones. For among these is the small one, and the large one, soft and rough, long, and round-ended with branches (projections).
Therefore know its kind so that it may signify to you by this above what is under your hand.
But if blood overcomes you then add to the place some grated egg yolk and hold it for an hour until the blood ceases (to flow).
Then return to your own work until the stone is expelled: and do as I prepare with you instruments that I have said for extracting stones from men so that they may aid you through them in your own operation (in women).
If you are overcome by bleeding and know that the blood is being expelled from a cut artery: then place dust on the area, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: do not remove this until you can release the stone, and do not let go of it otherwise. Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die. Then care for the wound.
Whenever there is an accumulation of blood and the site becomes putrid after days, then return to surgery until the stone passes.
Chapter 62.
§ Regarding a superficial hernia.
The watery swelling is not, but an accumulation of moisture in a white lining, which is contained under the skin enclosing the scrotal membrane: and it is called a hydrocele.
And sometimes it is within the individual's own panniculus adiposus, which nature has prepared for him in part of his scrotum, until putrefaction occurs: this is another thing, and is a layer of skin between the testicular sheath and the white lamentation that we have described: and it rarely happens.
And indeed this generation of the branch is from weakness which occurs in the testicles: therefore it discharges into them this matter. And sometimes it happens by a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. Or indeed its color declines to yellowishness, or it is blood-red, or dirty, black, or it is white watery, and this is more common.
And the signs by which one knows where there is an accumulation of water are these. For if it is in the white lining that we have described, then there is a round swelling of about equal length as the figure of his scrotum: and the testicle does not appear because moisture contains it from all sides.
And if there is moisture in its own peritoneum, then it is a round abscess with an opening elsewhere, and for this reason the man disregards it because he considers it to be another matter.
And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under feeling.
When therefore he has understanding of the color of moisture, then try to determine the color of moisture in an abscess with a square intrusion, whose form prevails. According to that which emerges from the examination of the intrusion, judge what is between it.
When therefore we come to healing with iron, then it is proper to instruct the sick person that if possible for him, he should be bled with a fleam, and you see his body full.
Then lies on his back over something high but low, and place under him many cloths.
Then sit on his left and instruct the servant to sit on his right, who extends a splinter of wood to one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the milky veins.
Then take a wide gauze, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the comb: and make an incision according to the rectitude of a line that equally divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane that encompasses them: and remove it and observe, or if possible for you, cut it off: and let your excoriation be such as removes part of itself on the side that suspends with the opening more: and subtly scrutinize along the excoriation according to what is possible for you.
Then pierce a full white membrane with a large hole, and extract all water out of it.
Then separate between two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the white membbean to the upper parts, and do not touch the skin that encompasses the testicles: and cut in any way possible for you to cut it, either entirely or piece by piece, especially its side subtly. Therefore, if you do not examine it carefully, there is no security in making the incision, that water may return.
But if the matter proceeds from outside of its own skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision with a needle, return it. Then gather together two lips of the scrotum skin with stitches.
Next care for it as other wounds until healed.
But if you find the matter rotten from another blackness, then it is necessary that flexible tubes, which are supports, fear the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the support, and take it out: afterwards care for that thing as we have said.
But if water is collected in two parts, then you know that they are two branches: so cut the other part as you did in one equally.
And if it seems equal to you, that there should be but one operation, then do this: afterwards clean blood away. And insert into the sections wool soaked in oil or rose oil: and place another kind of wool that you have dipped in wine and oil upon it externally over the two testicles, and apply mirach ointment on them: and place double cloths above, and there are pulvilli (tassels): and tie these up with a band from above with a ligament which has six ties according to this form.
Then two cloths are taken and washed, and filled with la na ointment according to this likeness: and make the ends that are pressed by a cote or wet wool: and they are gathered with an envelope in lumbar sacs: and one end takes over from the anus up to the back, and the second takes on the side of the sternum: and two ends above the hips downward, and two other ends above the groin, and it is gathered together wholly in lumbar sacs.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated at the place of section with a knife; and it is as you have received the cautery in a delicate chisel, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we mentioned: until when it reveals a white substance containing water; then receive the cautery according to this method.
The Greek letters are assimilated into the Latin script.
Then the catheter is inserted with it; and it is ignited until all the moisture has come out.
Then extend the catheter with a hook; and scrape off with a fine-tipped heated cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until all of its roots are removed.
And from the egg, so that the fire does not touch the flesh.
And know that this operation is more healing and farther from blood flow, and better than the procedure with incision.
If however you encounter difficulty in the hour of incision or in the hour of applying heat (cauterization), a hot sore, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes trouble to you from there with the treatment appropriate to it, according to as mentioned.
If however he is weak and fearful, and does not await this procedure because of its frightfulness: then apply the catheter according to what I have told you that; and it is.
When you are certain among yourself according to what we have said about the indications, that the branch is watery: then it is necessary that you do make him sit on a swept seat.
Then apply the catheter at an ulcer on its lower part with a wide-tipped instrument: and place the catheter according to the length of the body, and leave the opening large, until all water flows out.
Then place it over the hollow part and bind its body, and let it drain any remaining water; then care for it until the wound is healed.
But if there is a hindrance to the drainage at the time you perforate it; and this is only due to the fact that the white fibrous tissue causes an obstruction in the wound opening, preventing water exit: then it is necessary to insert a penned into the wnid, or use a tool from which water of hydropic is extracted (whose form has precedence): or add slightly to the operation of the wound.
And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months or so. Therefore, when it accumuleby the same method, and passes through its own days of illness.
Chapter 63.
§ On treating thickened veins.
Know that in the dissection over this thick vein, there is out of fear for causing harm to many arrangements. Therefore, it seems appropriate to me that its dismissal be healing from that.
And I am recalling the operation on that and inflammations of wound sores.
Therefore I say, that many swellings occur in bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens for various reasons, namely. (The text cuts off here without listing the reasons)
Or due to sharpness or bitternebrous fluid that flows into the testicles. Or due to impact. (This instruction is incomplete as well and should
And the color of swellings corresponds to that of the body, and pain is not found therein; it is a serious boil. (This text appears to be incomplete or cut off.)
And perhaps it is a stone boil, the color of which is brownish, and no feeling is found therein. (This text also appears to be incomplete or cut off.)
And sometimes it happens due to the swelling of arteries and their inflammation: as already mentioned earlier; or due to venous congestion. (Again, the text seems incomplete.)
Therefore, what is derived from them through swelling of the vessels is recognized by the arrangement of ulcers when you compress it with your fingers. And yet, it must not be touched at all.
But that which is due to the swelling of veins cannot be dispersed by anything through compression with your fingers.
And now it is possible that a section is made on this kind of thing and on the remaining flesh, which involves cutting off scrotal skin. Then extend the veins upwards and take out the flesh with a sharp knife: and free the ligaments of the veins: and cut the ligaments after you have freed the flesh from all sides by parts.
If therefore the veins are united with those of the buttocks, then you must grasp the veins and cut out the flesh.
And if there is an attachment between some of the veins or within the ligaments themselves: then you must free all that attachment and cut it out with a round incision.
And if there is the birth of flesh at a place behind that attachment: then you must cut out all of it and remove the veins as we have said.
When therefore your operation is completed, fill the wound with a poultice of linen soaked in rose oil and wine: then attend to it as well as the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
§ Regarding the cure for gouty joints which is with vinegar.
It is an ulcer formed by some kind of swelling, resembling a blister, with the softening of scrotal skin: and it becomes difficult over the weakened movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is from fear, because of that which preceded it.
But let me say about performing an operation on this according to what the first ones did.
Therefore, I say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on an elevated bed. Then push the scrotal supports towards the lower parts. Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, using forceps that are close to the shrine: and let another servant hold it, and stretch it firmly.
Then make an incision with a sharp, broad knife obliquely across the direction of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then excise it from all sides as we have told you before in extracting the arteries that are on the temples.
Then fix a hook at which there is a double thread, and tie the flesh at the first locations where branches occur, and tie it again on the last of them. Then cut it out straight across in the middle according to the length of the body, and extract what is attached from moist foul secretions.
Then take care of the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, where you can make a healthy incision so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles are shed. For it is not a bad thing through this.
But if this happens to branches in all vessels, then it is necessary that they are extracted because of the testicles with vessels: so that there will not be a stoppage of nourishment due to incision and shrinkage, and bleeding will cease, and it will not swell with them.
Chapter LXV.
¶ On healing the bowel knots.
The end of this bowel knot is from a section that occurs on the rectum above the abdamen on the side of the groins near the great veins.
Why do the intestines descend from there due to rupture to one of the testicles. And this rupture is either from the rectum or its extension.
And these two kinds occur for many reasons: either from impact, or leakage, or noise, or serious illness, and similar ones.
And a mark, when it is from the extension of an ulcer. And it occurs gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly; and the abscess is equal in depth around; therefore, because the ulcer compresses the inte**
And the sign of this is when it comes from the section of an ulcer because its intense pain happens suddenly at its beginning; and the abscess is varied in appearance, close to the skin: and that one results from the exiting of the intestine, and the course thereof towards the external ulcer.
And sometimes it comes out with an intestinal fistula; and this is called the Intestinal Ramus, and a Zibelain; and sometimes it happens with puffiness.
And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and remains there; and this is accompanied by great peril for the sick person because it causes a dull pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this disease's species with iron is fear; therefore it must be ensured that there is no cause for it.
And the method of operation is to advise the sick person to bring in their own hand the intestine back towards its inner recesses if it returns willingly. Then he lies on his neck between your hands: and support his legs gently.
Then extend the skin that follows to the upper part, and shave the entire scrotum lengthwise. Then fix the two lip edges of the incision with a hook as you find to open the incision with them; and let the incision be made according to quantity that is possible so that it can come out from this wound.
Then scrape the ulcer and what is under the skin of the testicles until a hard white ulcer shows itself all around: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, between the ulcer album which is under the skin, and between the sifach as well; and detach completely from its adherence on the posterior part of the scrotum.
Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and while doing this, stretch an alb with your left hand, and latch them together at the division point: instruct the assistant to also raise theirs, and you loosen any attachment that is completely detached.
And use your fingers to check if there'amo not something from the empty intestine into the white hard alb. If, however, you find anything from that within it: then push it downward to the lower belly.
Then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands: and insert it behind the last alb, that is, under the tunics that follow the division below the skin of the testicles; then cut off the protruding tips until there are four strands remaining. Then connect some of them together with the figure that resembles a cross-shape; and bind them to the alb mentioned earlier, which is the ligament under the skin of the testicles, until they cannot send anything from the vessels, which nourish them, into them: so that it does not happen there afterward a hot swelling. And place another ligament next to the first ligament, about two fingers away from it. And after these two ligaments inside the alb that is under the skin of the testicles, measure a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut off the rest around it completely, and remove them from there.
Then cut off the lower part of the skin of the testicles from where the blood and pus flow; as we have mentioned above.
Then apply moist wool soaked in oil to the wound: and place there the ligaments we have mentioned. (Note: The translation is based on a medieval Latin medical text, which can contain terminology that doesn't always directly map onto modern English anatomical or surgical terms; therefore, certain liberties were taken for clarity.) And at times it is branded white syphax that we have mentioned, after making an incision there to prevent the flow of blood. But often this happens. And release the ligament until it falls off by itself.
But if this case is delayed, then pour warm water on it: and place that which we have mentioned upon it, until it falls off.
Then care for the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until healed.
Head LXVI.
§ On the draft wind (whooping cough).
In this whooping cough, I have not seen anyone brave enough to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated for whooping cperture which has a draft wind (whooping cough). This is to say, the strips of leather are used after cutting over it with ease below: then dried in the middle, and care for them lastly with that which opens it up until they fall off: and care for the wound as we have said, until healed.
Head LXVII.
§ On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
When the rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and a place protrudes out, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little amount, and returns at all times: but if prolonged for that time, an ulceration will be added in syphax until the intestines descend into syphax.
And this happens from the extension of syphax that is in the groin as we have said. This is because the syphax extends out: then softens it and applies a compress to the place, which protrudes out.
And its care is with branding as has been said in its previous account.
And sometimes it is cared for with iron according to this method: and it stays on the back of the patient between your hands. Then, one should dry the place of a rupture or prominent swelling by cutting across its width, according to the amount for three fingers.
Then bind it tightly with a cloth, and whatever is under the skin until when the white bandage, which is also under the skin, appears.
Then take a rod and place it over the prominent swelling from the white bandcuce, and press it deep into the folds.
Then take two prominent places above the end of the rod from the white bandage, and connect one of them with a stitch to the other; then remove the end of the rod.
And do not cut the white bandage at all, nor stretch the wound, nor anything else, as you know from curing intestinal branches.
Then take care of that treatment for wounds. Whenever you cut sutures, clean it and heal the wound until it solidifies.
The white bandage itself is tightening, and no prominence of rupture is added.
And a caustic is better in this place: for it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
Regarding the softening of scrotal skin.
Often the skin of the scrotum is softened in certain people because the flesh between them is also softened, and it becomes ugly-looking.
Therefore, the one who is asked for treatment of it must make him lie on his back, and cut off all softened skin over natural skin.
Then gather the two lips with a stitch; and if you can, do first three excesses of softened skin with stitches or four, and a firm st^racture.
Then cut between the stitches.
Then take care of treatment for other wounds, until they heal, and the sutures fall off.
Chapter 69.
Section on Castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for this reason it was permisseby me not to remember it in this book of mine; and there is no need for its mention except for two reasons.
One of them being that it should be known to the physician when asked about it and so that he may know its treatment when such a thing occurs.
And another reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit by this method, such as ram, hedgehog, cat, and similar beasts from the animal kingdom.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. (Note: The translation may slightly vary depending on the rest of the text for context.) Either by wearing down. (Note: A complete solution would depend Or through a crack and incision. (Note: The actual translation may vary based on the full context of the text
In that which is done by wearing down, the method of procedure is as follows: We make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and become relaxed and hanging, then tear them off with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear upon touch. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
For the castration by cracking and cutting, you should hold the animal and press its scrotal skin with your left hand. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
Then tie the suspender and cut above all along one side of the incision until two sides are exposed: then make an incision on both after you have scraped them off, and do not let anything other than a very fine substance fall onto it, which is over gauze. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
And this method of castration is better than the one that happens by weaving down because wear and tear may leave something from the testicles, which is why the animal needs to mate. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
Then care for the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70.
Then there are two methods of treating Hermaphroditus.
The Hermaphrodite is considered in two ways as a man. One of them is because a space appears that follows, or within the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, with the shape of a woman's vagina, where hairs are present: and sometimes urine flows from what is inside the skin of the testicles.
In women there is one kind of species, and it resembles a woman's vagina placed on the chest like masculine testicles altogether protruding to the outside: one of which is like a penis of a man, and two as two testicles.
And the treatment of three kinds of species, two from men and one from women, is as follows: because it must be that you cut away added flesh until the imprint of those marks disappears. Then care for other wound treatments.
However, the treatment of the second kind from men, from which urine comes out within the skin of the testicles, is not a surgery nor any kind of its treatment at all.
Chapter 71.
Then regarding the incision of tentigoes and protruding flesh on women's vaginas.
Perhaps a tentigo is added over the natural one until it becomes disgusting and an ugly appearance of it: and sometimes it is magnified in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and comes to sexual intercourse.
Therefore one must hold the excess of tentigoes with a hand or with an hook, and cut them: but do not end the incision especially at the root's depth, so that blood loss does not happen.
Then care for the actual treatment of wounds until they heal.
However, the flesh that is born is the flesh which originates from the maternal orifice, until it fills up this space; and perhaps it exits externally according to the likeness of a tail; and for this reason some call it tail-illness. Therefore, we must attack her as we attacked the Swelling, and heal her until she is healed.
Of treating the Alratic condition, which is a hole in the woman that has not been pierced.
Chapter 72.
The Alratic condition is such that it be a hole in the woman or a small opening. And it is either natural or accidental.
The accidental one is from an illness that preceded it: and this indeed comes about either due to added flesh or subtle sinew or thickening; and it occurs either deep in the maternal orifice, or on its sides, or at the top of it, or at the bottom of it. It prevents intercourse, impregnation, childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
And recognition of this is through an obstetrical examination if there is a visible bulge near it.
But if it does not appear, then you search for it with your fingers or with the rod.
If however there is a bulge from subtle sinew and it is near to two lips, then do so promptly, and break the same apart.
And it is as if you place something small over the two lips.
Then put your fingers of both hands at once, and let the woman be on her back with spread apart legs. Then extend the two lips with strength until the subtle sinew is broken and the bulge opens up.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and put the same on top of the place: and let the woman rub there every day, so that another spot does not harden up.
However, if a sifface is thick and dense: then it should be cut with a paste similar to that of bay leaves.
However, if the swelling is of fleshly origin: then suspend it with a hook and make an incision in it; and be with medicines that suppress bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and combined with alburnum.
Then apply a large lead cannula so that the wound is not congested quickly, hold it for several days; and then administer linseed lime oil, afterwards care for the remaining treatment until healed.
And at times when births occur from the womb of other creatures: therefore they should be incised according to this manner: as long as there is no inflammebile tumor that has been tumored with cancer itself within the womb, do not cause any opposition with iron altogether.
Chapter 73.
§ For the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelill and Bothorus redness in women's swellings.
Indeed, hemorrhoids are an opening of the venous orifices until blood flows out from them in great amounts persistently.
And so when we treat hemorrhoids, thymel are formed: and I have already spoken about the division of those kinds and their signs; and here I will say which receive treatment from them and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids that are located at the opening of the womb and not visible to sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
But those from among them that are located at the opening of the w [womb] above which sense falls: these are treatable.
Therefore it should be to introduce a woman into a cold house. Then extend Athelill with forceps or with rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Then powder over them at the flow of blood from a ground powder without bites: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and so on.
Then he pushes his feet against the wall for one hour. Afterward, place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and grape skins, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegard, and create a plaster from it on her back.
If therefore blood is separated with it, it is good; and if not, let it stick to the back with vents, and nipples, without scraping.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of Taraxia, or the juice of Arno grasshopper, or the juice of winged alauda (gallinaceous bird), that is, without shearing, with Pontic wine, and let it stick to the eyelids.
Whenever the abscess calms down, then heal the place with ointments, until healed.
However, red albatross is similar to heads of alhaas (a type of camelid), and it has a rough appearance.
Therefore, you must cut what appears from it, as I said before equally: and heal it itself, until healed.
Chapter 74.
§ About the perforation of a uterus that occurs during childbirth.
In the womb there occur many kinds of abscesses, such as carcinoma, and stone-abscess, and ulcers, and sores with a crust, and smallpox, and eczema, that is, herpes, stitching, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragged (wounds), and heat abscesses.
And indeed, I have already said of all these illnesses and their kinds, as well as the signs of them and their treatments in division: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about swelling that occurs in the womb, which arises from those that heal ligatures, and how one should know how its opening is done with iron.
It is therefore important to consider: the treatment of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid Then if the pain of a swelling on its inception is sharp with palpation and heat and fever, and you see it reddening: if sensations fall upon it, then do not hasten to puncture it: and treat it as long as healing occurs above when the severity of symptoms subsides.
Then it is fitting to make the woman sit on a seat that suffers two chairs and lean, or lie down on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her vagina: and let her thighs be spread out, and she places her arms under her knees, and ties both ligaments suitable to this.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and give the instrument that opens the birth canal entrance.
And when you are to give this instrument, make it with a depth of the birth canal as wide as the woman's pelvis: so that what is inserted from the tool shall not be more than the depth of the birth canal and hurt the sick one.
But if the tool were more than the depth of the birth canal, then you should place small cushions on top of the seat of the depth of the birthamo: so that the entrance of the tool is completely in the depth of the birth canal: and it should be placed a swelling which runs along the side of the tool above: and hold the tool itself, and have the assistant move the swelling until the depth of the birth canal opens.
Therefore, when the incision appears and is touched with a hand, it is gentle and soft; then one must cut it at its head with a slightly broad knife.
Therefore, when the blood is drained, then one must place a compress soaked in rose oil or greenish oil with some stickiness on it; and after placing the compress, extract out of the wound into a deep sack.
And place outside on the sack, and over the chest with clean woolen cloth soaked in water that contains light froths.
Then it will be treated after two days with an ointcuh suitable for this, until it heals.
And sometimes the sack and wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water containing the root of a lily or Aristolochia longa; and then return to ointment.
That if the wound is hidden internally in the sack, then one must restrain it from its treatment with iron; indeed treat it as we mentioned in division.
Chapter 70.
§ Knowledge of Midwifery, how embryos are healed by the image not natural to be born.
It is necessary for a midwife to know first of all the figure of natural childbirth.
Therefore, from these signs, when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and light is reflected over her that lies above childbirth, and hasten the exit of the embryo: then know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and it exits through its head, and turning with it: or hanging, or suspended from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then one must compress her belly so that the embryo descends quickly.
Therefore, when it descends upon its head, it is accompanied by a second one, and they cleanse themselves of excesses with good purification.
Whoever else there may be besides this offspring, it is unnatural, to be lamented.
Since sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet and exits with its body before its head, and its feet or hands alone, or one foot only; or it exits with its head and hands; or even the buttocks; and perhaps it turns over onto its back, along with other admirable shapes.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle about all these matters, and she should guard herself against error and deceit: and I am showing every shape from among them, and how there is an understanding in each one, and it signifies by that, and stands over it.
When the fetus exits naturally upon its head, and a powerful flow occurs over the woman, and difficult childbirth ensues, weakening her strength: then make her sit on a stool or have women hold her: and apply warm wine with foenugraecum decoction, and moist oils.
Then the midwader introduces a sponge-like cloth between her fingers and strikes with it upon a second one, and cuts off its nail of hers until what is in it runs out from moisture: and she presses the woman's perineum, until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema of the woman with a mixture from foenugraecum and sesame oil.
Then instruct her to press after the enema: and have her sneeze with compresses, and hold one of her mouths and noses for an hour each. Therefore, the fetus should come out immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, one must gradually push them back with ease. However, if this is not possible during delivery, place the woman on a stool and elevate her feet: then shake the seat onto the ground; and keep the woman steady so she does not fall due to the impact.
If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then incise them, and remove any remaining fetal tissue; fasten her hand with cloth, and extract it evenly: for she will also emerge.
The exit of an embryo above its feet. (This phrase seems to lack context or appears incomplete in the original Latin translation.) When the fetus emerges above its feet, one must push them upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards align it properly. (This phrase seems to be giving procedural advice for breech deliveries.)
Then take one of its feet and slowly extend it. (Providing instructions on how to handle a footling breech delivery where only the feet or legs are presenting first.)
But if the baby comes as far as the thighs, instruct her to press and make her sneeze with spittle: she will come out, if God wills it. (This is likely referencing a technique or hopeful saying rather than specific medical advice.)
And if it does not come out as we described, then gradually push the fetus back until you can place it in its natural position. (Advice for repositioning a breech baby within the womb before attempting delivery.) For he himself will come out then with an easy exit. (A statement about the potential ease of delivering a fetus once properly positioned for birth.)
But if you are prevented with the whole thing that we described: then take honey from a high-altitude beehive, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum resin; and strike it completely in a mortar through good percussioning: then line it with wool of a young woman, and her lower vent. (A description likely related to making some type of medicinal preparation or poultice.) Then make her sit in warm water until menstruation occurs.
And so when you see that the lower parts are already warmed up, then make her take some of myrrh powder and apply it to herself. When she holds one hour, then make her sit on top of the seat. Then make her sneeeblow and close her mouth and nose, and gently press the lower part of the womb with a light pressure. For immediately the fœtus will come out.
¶ The exit of the fetus over thighs and hands. When it comes out following this method, then gently insert her own fingers gradually into [the vagina]. Then the woman lies on her back, and her feet hang down to the lower parts: and she sits lying on the bed, and folds her hands together. Then press gently above [the womb] gradually. Then extract what is under her feet from the dregs, until it is prepared on the lower part. But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion. Then press gradually what is above [the vagina], until the fetus goes up to the upper parts. Then she gently inserts her own fingers and balances the fetus gradually: and command the woman to press until the fetus comes out.
¶ The exit of the fetus hanging down from [the] hands. She is inserted into a withdrawal of her hands. But if she cannot draw it out, then comfort the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shocking.
Then apply an ointment that you prepared from muds.
But if she accepts [the birth], then make her sit on top of the seat. Then attend to the setting of bones and properly align according to natural shape; and cause a woman to sneeamoorthe woman to be instructed to press down until she gives birth.
Then the fetus lies over its neck, with hands spread and face against the mother's back. It is necessary for the midwife to hold the fetus with her hand and then gradually turn it until it is properly positioned.
Once this is corrected, place as described on our female over the area with oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move it gradually. Once you have done this, then make her sit on the stool and instruct her to lean to the right side. Then instruct her to press down with conditions for sneezing.
Then the fetus is positioned over one side. When it descends to the birth canal as described with assistance from a woman's companion, then cut the companion's nail with your fingernail until it dries out.
If thusly the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then cut it from the navel so that it does not hold on and die.
Then push the fetus into the body until placed as it should be: and instruct the woman to press down several times, for indeed he will come out lightly.
Then twins or multiple offspring are born. Know that twins often occur: and sometimes three, and sometimes four are born at once. But this is foreign and rare.
Five on the other hand are unnatural and do not live entirely: they are held together by a single companion woman: and separated through dissection, distinguishing between them with a string tied to each one's navel.
And sometimes they emerge as does a single fetus from natural birth, easily; and they emerge unfortunate, as I have described.
But if some of them are difficult at birth, and come to what we have described from unnatural figures; then care for them as I have described: and let it be with a subtle stretcher, doing both easily and slowly, and forming according to every figure that is prepared by the skill guiding toward health.
Recall that it forms in the womb from embryos, and they abort.
Sometimes it forms in the womb one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and many more ten: and I have verified that a woman while aborting has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That was measured by the great wise man.
Therefore, this should be entirely in the knowledge of the obstetrician. For perhaps it may come to that similar to those: thus oppose it with what is fitting.
Chapter 76.
¶ Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care for a dead fetus as I have described in division from medicine, and it does not emerge, and you resort to the operation with your hand, then you should consider.
If then the woman is of sound constitution and not with any one from which she fears ruin: then it should be that she lies on a bed, on her back, and her head inclined lower, and her legs elevated: and a servant holds her by both sides or ties to the bed so as not to extract the body of hers during the fetal extraeusure.
Then moistened the mouth of the womb with oils damped by an abundance of mucilage from poppy juice and fenugreek, and flax seeds.
Then the midwife fastens her hand with those oils and cataplasms; then she inserts it into the womb easily. Then she seecuires the place where to insert the hooks from the fetus and suitable places for it.
Consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend onto its head: then fix the hooks on its eyes, or neck, or mouth,amo, palate, or under its beard, or on its shoulders, and near the hip bones.
If however the descent is over his feet, then on the chest, and along the sides of his body.
And it must be that she holds the hook with her right hand; and places elasticity between the fingers of her left hand: and inserts with her hand easily, and fixes the hook on one of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches a hollow space.
Then she fixes on the opposite of his hook another one or third if you seek it: so that there is equal contraction, and it does not lean towards any side.
Then be extended to an equal length, and not just according to straightness; indeed move it towards every side, so as to ease its passage out: as with a tooth during extraction from him.
And it must be that within that, there is softened extension. That if it retains a part of that, then it must be that the midweb fastens some fingers with oil and inserts them from the side so as to revolve around what is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetam has been expelled.
If however the hand emerges before others and cannot be reduced, because of its compression: then it must be that a cloth revolves over it. Then remove it once it emerges completely; make an incision at the joint of the foot or at the knee. In this way, you must create a shape like a hand and two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large or it happens that there is a blockage during delivery, or water has accumulated within its head; then one must insert the spatula-like tool among its fingers and break off the head along with it, and remove the fluid: or crush it using an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with other tools mentioned in the chapter following this.
Likewise, if the fetus is of large head nature, then one must perform a cesarean section; or remove it with an Almisdac as we mentioned earlier. Then grasp the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and there is a blockage at the clamp: then it must be found until the moisture inside the chest is released.
But if there are no complications and it does not aid delivery: then you must cut the head as much as possible according to what is achievable by you.
Which if there is a boil below the vagina or it has an accumulation of water: then one must puncture it until the moisture flows out from it.
However if the fetus is above its feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mother's mouth is light.
But if there is a blockage at the vagina or chest: then one must remove it with cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and blow into the vagina or chest until whatever is inside comes out.
But if other body parts are removed and the head returns: then the midwife must insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the mother is open, then one must insert a hand deep into the womb and search with it for the head, and draw out as far as the mouth of the mother; then one must insert either one hook or two hooks, and draw out as much as possible from there.
If the uterine bone is fractured due to a hot suppuration that has occurred there, then it should not be required to work on it; instead, one should administer an infusion of moistening substances and fatty materials, and apply plasters, and let it rest in waters that soften and moisturize.
If the fetus is on its side, it may be possible to correct it; then administer what we have mentioned for live fetuses.
If that is not possible, then it should be lanced gradually and removed in parts.
And one must ensure nothing is expelled from the second stage entirely.
Once you have completed your surgery, then administer what we have mentioned for hot suppurations that occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, it should be allowed to flow into astringent waters, and one should administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed, I have already seen a woman whose womb was dead following the death of a fetus; then she became pregnant again with another, but then that fetus also died. Therefore, she experienced a long-lasting suppuration at her navel and became swollen until it was opened; then it began to discharge pus.
I have been called for her treatment, and have treated her over a prolonged period; the wound has not yet healed solidly.
Therefore, I applied certain strong attracting plasters to it, and discharged pus from the site. Then several days passed, and more pus was discharged. I have been astonished by this therefore, since there is no bone left in the womb.
I considered that these were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I examined the wound and extracted many bones from a woman who was otherwise in good health: she has now survived for such a prolonged time and discharges only a little pulsating pus from it.
And I have not established this foreign thing here, except because there is knowledge and help for it, which a physician-artificer administers with his hand in healing.

On the necessary forms of instruments for extracting the fetus.
The form of the vertigo which opens the womb.
Here is the form of the traction instrument, which balances books and two twists are equal on both ends of two pieces of wood. However, this vertigo must be with a finer traction instrument; and so it is made from either ebony or seasoned wood.
And the entire width of each piece of wood is like two fingers; and the edge of both has a margin as if one finger, and their length is a hand wide and halfway: and between these two pieces ofwood are two additions from that type of wood, already firmly placed in both, whose length is half a palm and slightly more, and their width is like two fingers or slightly less.
And these two additions are inserted into the womb's mouth so that it opens when you withdraw with them both vertigos.
Another similar but finer and lighter form.
Made from ebony or seasoned wood, according to the likeness of pincers. However, at the end of it there are two additions, just as you see above here: and the length of each addition is like a hand wide, and their width is like two fingers.
So when you want to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging between her legs. Then insert these two connected additions into the womb: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the birth canal, so that the midwife does what she wants.
Shape of agitation other than the one called by the ancients as Forma Impellentang (the shape that propels the fetus).
Shape of Albucasis, which is used to cut large heads; and it resembles a forceps with teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is oval like a forceps of this shape as you see with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which to cut and trim.
Shape with one spike (forceps).
Shape with two prongs (forceps).
Shape for cutting off heads with two blades (forceps).
Also shape of two Cuttlebugs. This could be interpreted as a reference to another type of surgical tool or instrument used in the same
These instruments are all used together; the more their types multiply, and the more they are prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for performing operations, and higher in humans, because of their quantity. (The translation maintains a formal tone while conveying the original message about the importance of using multiple well-prepared instruments.)
Therefore do not disdain any of these instruments if they are prepared among you. (The translation captures a didactic tone from the source text, emphasizing the importance of every instrument's preparation.) The need for them is indeed inexcusable. (This succinct sentence retains an assertive and authoritative tone found in many
Head seventy-eigh. (This numbered notation indicates a particular method
Concerning the extraction of a breech child. (The translation delivers clear instruction while pres
When the breech child is retained during labor, then it is necessary to instruct the weakened, so that they retain their breathing (i.e., encourage the mother not to push). (The translation interprets a medical directive from historical practice while maintaining original context.) Then make her sneeze with the following conditions: and place your hand firmly on her mouth, and her nostrangs. If she therefore comes out by this [method], it is good.
If not, then take a bowl and pierce the cover's hole: and place in it herbs that open the womb's mouth, such as calamint, rue, anise, camomile, sage, woody cedar, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them with water, and put them on fire.
Then place a reed's bulb over the cover's hole of the bowl, and another end into her mouth; and hold it until vapors reach the womb's swelling.
Then make her sneeze, as we said. For secondine will come out easily.
But if she remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command an obstetrician to immerse his hand in saffron oil or tall poppy syrup. Then insert into the womb and seek what is secondine with it. When he has found her, then take her and gradually stretch out.
But if she is deeply attached within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we said until when he finds secondine and gradually pulls her out straight according to rectitude, so that it does not fall onto a strong pulling force: on the contrary, it must be turned with ease towards both right and left sides; after this add in amount of attraction. For she indeed then submits and is served, and flees from attachment.
Which if the womb's mouth is curtailed as we already said: care for it with sneezing, and from the bowl treatment with herbs.
However, if it does not come out with all that we have described, then do not worry about the bone during the process of extraction.
However, it is necessary that what emerges to the mother'amo reedile from that, be close to the thigh of the woman. Then purify her with a clitoral ointment made of four drugs. For indeed it will putrify after days, and dissolve, and come out.
However, when it rots, remove the bad smell from the stomach and head, and harm that thing weakens her. Therefore, they must administer appropriate fumigations to this.
However, some of the ancients were already experienced in fumigation with nasturtium and dry figs.
The form of the instruments to be used for fumigating a woman during Retentio Secundina (retained second stage labor) and menses.
Let a container be made similar to an alcama or from wax: and the wide end is placed over fire: and the fumigation shall be positioned above plums: hold it until that fumigamoination is consumed: and do another one.
Chapter LXXIX.
Of healing for Ana not pierced.
Many children are born, and the child of Ana is not pierced, whom she already delivered with a gentle forceps. Therefore, the midwife must pierce that notch with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula: and beware of touching it.
Then put over it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then take care of that thing with ointments until it heals.
However, if you have pierced too much, then place a lead pipe in the hole for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to relieve himself.
And indeed Ana already had a piercing from the healing of wounds or pustules. Therefore, it is necessary to perform that consolidation, then care for it with what we mentioned in the healing and lead (plumb).
Chapter 80.
From the treatment of Flutes which occur on the lower part.
The Flutes that occur on the lower part are Swelling and Thickening occurring near the genital openings: or in a space of one side: and it is a single Flute or several. (This sentence seems to be discussing types of fistulas or swellings related to surgical procedures, which might refer to Albucasis's descriptions.)
Therefore, when that Swelling is outdated, it opens up and runs with a white watery moisture or thin pus. (This sentence talks about the management of swellings as described in ancient medical texts.)
And sometimes they are from piercing Flutes. (The reference to "Fistulas" here may relate to surgical punctures or perforations Therefore these piercing Flutes are recognized by what comes out with evacuation and breathing when the sick uses evacuation: and perhaps it comes from them worms (this could be a reference to Albucasis' medical practices regarding surgery or the treatment of certain conditions related to fluid discharge).
And these are Flutes that are piercing up to the vesicle and up to the vaginal foreskin (this likely refers to types of fistulas or abnormal openings in surgical contexts). And these are piercing Flutes up to the hip joint and up to the tail knot (this could be a description of anatomical landmarks in relation to surgical fistulas or similar medical conditions).
From this also by which is recognized the piercing Flute up to the genital opening, even from the non-piercing one, it is such that you put your finger into the genitals: and you insert a thin thread in the Flute with wire or iron when there is no twisting (this instruction could pertain to surgical techniques described by Albucasis for treating fistulas).
But if there is a twisting (in the fistula or pathway), then you insert into it with a thin lead wire, or a feather from eagle's quills, until you feel the wire or quill in your finger (this sentence elaborates on surgical procedures for handling complex cases of fistulas).
If you do not feel it fully within yourself and nothing proceeds from the opening due to excretion or winds or a worm as I have mentioned; then you know that it is not penetrating: so be quick in providing treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladaster or urethra; then its indication is an exit of urine from it, and prevention from this so that it may be solidified with medicine at that place.
But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint or into the pelvis bone; then its sign is that it reaches there with probes if there is no twisting as far as the bone: and discovery of pain in the region, and that pus always flows from it: and that treatment does not prevail in it nor solidifies with ointment.
And for all these fistulas that are penetrating there is no treatment at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vanity upon him from foolish doctors who form their opinion on it.
But for those that are not penetrating and new, it is hoped to heal with a bandage: as I tell you, and I have already tested it: and it lies sickly in your hands upon its back: and the branches of his legs up above its hips; and its hips themselves bend towards the windshaft. Then for those that are introduced with lead or air if it is a fistula with twisting, until you know where the probe has reached.
But if the sickly feels it around his anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into his anus.
But if you feel the probe already having penetrated through itself detected, besides that you felt between your finger and its flesh: then indeed you know it is penetrangible: therefore no labor on it, for there is not its cure, as I have said.
However, they say that it is healed in some men through flesh and the hope placed on treatment, to subtly cauterize the narrowness of the fistula as if it has passed, and insert the burning material into the f지stula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat that process twice or three times until you know that all those added meats have been burned and filtered, which are like the tubes of a bird's feather.
Then take care of that process with ointments dissolved in butter until those burned meats are expelled; then take care of it with ingredients generating and solidifying flesh.
If however healed, good is achieved.
And if not, then never heals with another treatment ever.
And if it is expelled when tested and does not reach up to your finger inside the anus, which lies between that thick layer made of flesh or syrup: and you see the fistula in what follows on the surface of the skin, then cut off the skin from where the fistula begins, and you go cutting with that which is inside the fistule, until it reaches the incision where the extremity has reached, and releases the tentacle and falls.
Then purify those filtered meats which are like tubes of a bird's feather so that nothing remains from them.
However if blood overcomes you, and dissolves between you and your operation as it separates those meats: then better what is done, and faster healing, to cauterize it with fire or with acute medicine.
For the fire from the caustery combines good habits, adding burning to those added meats, and incision of blood, and drying moisture.
Then attend to that matter with ointments applied on honey or beaten calves' intestines until it discharges pus and the burnt flesh falls into it.
Then care for that wound with solidified ointments producing hard flesh and there are medicines which have astringency and drying action.
For indeed when they heal, then it is already cured: and not repeated.
But if the fistula has reached as far as the depth of the buttocks and extends due to bodily excesses: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
But if indeed you feel weakness, and there is a membrane or flesh between yourself and it, and it is close to perforation: then no operation on that matter, but only according to the way of trust and hope.
That is because it is treated in one of three ways: or as we said, by burning the same, or cutting it out until you achieve a hollowness there, so that you can insert your spoon into it and heal from nearby. And do not proceed much with cutting, so that you do not cut the fence of the buttocks containing the anus, and it may occur to the weakened excretion unwillingly. Then attend to that matter as we said.
For perhaps it will heal: or you extend the membrane there and soften it yourself after cutting all of that to near the anus, as we said, or with weakness, or with another sharp tool. Then cleanse those sifted flesh which are in the cut, until you can with probing.
Then try restoration of the whole wound with cutting and the upper opening where it solidifies: and remains open fistula inside the buttocks, and will be weaker than the weakened one.
And at times the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the ane; then take hold of the probed extremity, which is like a quill plucked from a goose, that is to say, prepared leather, in this manner. And insert into it a wound thread of five threads and about so. Then insert the probe with a string into the fistula until you achieve its contouring.
But if it penetrates into the inner edge near it, then extract the string from that opening; so as to insert your finger in the anus and extract the extremity of the string, and join both ends together: and fasten each one, and dismiss them for a day or two days; and the more the thread is cut into the flesh, the better grip it. And when those meats which are between the two extremities of the string fall off, treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
But if the opening of the f groove is not penetrating: then make that thing pierce however prepared you are for it, as long as it is not deeply much. For indeed there is none with you to do this because of the arm, so that you will not cut yourself.
Then do as we have said until it heals.
The form of the spinal fistula which is found, whose curvature is sharply pointed, and one part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter 81.
Of the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out from the incision of them: and the treatment of fissures.
There are hemorrhoids in two ways. Therefore, some are like small bladders made of charcoamo or plums; or they seem to be grains of wheat. And among them there are small ones and large ones; the blood always flows from them, they are one, and there are many of them. And there are also outside the bladder and at its ends.
However, those that are outside the bladederelate more to being dry, from which a light yellowish water flows; or they have only scanty blood flow continuously: and they relate in color to the body.
And its healing method within the bladder is that you should advise a sick person to apply heat; and it is expressed until the bladder comes out, and small veins appear on your thighs. Therefore, suspend them with a hook or hold them with your nail. Then cut them near their roots.
But if they do not hold in hooks because of their moisture and softening themselves: then catch them with rough cloth or a leather piece from Codpiece, and pull them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision so that they remain in place like a caustic. Or burn them as precedented in the chapter of cauterization. Then take care of them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
But if the anus does not obey the expulsion, then administer a small enema to the sick person so that it is gently taken within the anus and submits quickly to the expulsion when he expresses himself.
But if the small veins are outside the anus, then their treatment is light and easy: and it is like catching them with your nail or hook, and cutting them. Then care for them as we have mentioned until they heal.
And if one is averse to cutting with iron, then you should administer the stitches to them in this manner. Take a wound thread and insert it into the needle. Then extract the thorn from above and make it penetrate with a sharp point at its root on one side: and wrap two ends of the thread around the needle, along its narrower part; and pull tightly the threads in such a way that they are parallel. Then bind the thread and remove the neednose.
Do this with all thorns, and let go one of them: so that it may not move from its place as blood flows out excessively.
Then apply the moistened bandage soaked in rose oil or cedar oil to the wound and place it on top of it; command the patient to rest. Then remove it when it falls off by itself.
And when the thorns fall off by themselves, care for them with ointments and continue treatment until they are healed.
§ On treating fissures. Often however they occur from dry stools and natural contraction of the tissues.
When they become aged and there is no moisture in them: then you should scrape with spatulas or your own nails until they are made wet, and remove the upper layer that prevents them from becoming solidified. Then care for them as needed until they harden properly.
If however they do not solidify: then repeat them with a stronger incision than the first one until there is much bleeding, and once they have scabbed over, care for them as needed until they heal.
§ On the treatment of mirror-like lesions and not mirror-like lesions: and pus thorns, and ants.
Chapter 82.
Chapter 8eb. You should know that the Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a lion's head; and it occurs throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and pain occurs during walking.
It is therefore necessary to cut out what surrounds the lion's head and hold it with forceps or a hook, and remove it from its root.
Then care for that: and if you can cauterize it as described in the previous chapter itself.
However, there is a small elevation that is dry, rough, porous, and rounded above the surface of the body. And it often occurs in the hands of boys.
And its treatment is to extend the elevation and cut it open; or bind it with a silk thread; or with hair until it falls off. And if you can, cauterize it as mentioned with fire or sharp medicine; and already the elevations facing are being removed, and not those not facing with the tool that I will mention.
Also the anthill is a small elevation that is porous and thick on top of the body's surface, penetrating deeply: and when found cold, it feels like an ant bite there, and occurs throughout the body; and most of it appears in hands.
And its treatment is to receive a tube from the goose feather or the strong raven'amoebiasis_feather: and place the tube over the anthill until it surrounds parts of the elevation by the tube. Then remove your hand with the tube, cut out what surrounds the anthill; and place it deep into the flesh, and remove the roots of the anthill from its root.
And if you can do this with an air or iron tube, according to this method.
Let a higher tube be drawn towards the sublime, with a hoarse and muffled sound, so that it may relieve pressure on the grasped finger and its own retraction.
If you wish to burn a (medical) scar by the method mentioned earlier for fly-bite cauterization in chapter on burning of Athelil.
Chapter 83.
Of the forms of instruments used for enemas in cases of constipation, winds, and colic.
Sometimes enemas are made from silver, brass, cast iron, or wrought iron.
And sometimes they are administered with small and large instruments according to those mentioned above.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of small children, be small: and for those whose anus are weak or painful, so too their enemas.
Large enema.
The head of the tube, that is, the upper part through which it is tied, be ample according to this model: and it has a clear distinction so that its opening where the tube enters into the anus is muffled, meaning not open, gentle, rough, drawn towards subtlety: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side it has one hole.
And the size of the hole is according to the thickness of its rays, and thicker but little, and it be an instrument where medicines from urine are placed: or from a strip of paper that follows the model of the small asphaltum: whose root is one handbreadth.
And it pierces through multiple holes like its retraction and has a space that equals the thickness of every finger. Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw wool that is made of ten threads or about that, and attach it with ointment like the small asphaltum. Therefore, when it is placed in that womb, a clyster is tightened at its head with strong constriction between two distinctions. Then the clyster is made with it.
And this is the form of these circles here depicted and openings.
However, the quality of making a clyster with it is as follows: fill an urn or bladder with medicine that has been heated to the amount the patient can bear; and let it not be too hot or very cold.
Then the patient is laid on his back and raises his legs to the upper part; and place it under him, that is, a skin or bandage on top of where people lie.
Then clean the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with flaxseed mucilage, or similar substances. Then insert its contents into the anus easily. Then the assistant receives the urn with both hands at once and expresses its contents forcefully until all that is in the ccuester has gone into the intestines.
Then remove the clyster and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
If he thinks the medicine is coming out of him, then hold as much as possible. And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more beneficial for resting.
If the clyster causes him discomfort from wind-like solutions and his evacuation is hastened: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are hemorrhoids or ulcers injuring the anus, then let it be a very gentle clyster, mild, from the clysters with which children are made.
And this is the form of a gentle clyster for where there is tight skin.
Chapter 84.
Now, as I have explained the treatment of wounds by division in a previous book, so too shall I address their healing with hands and medicine according to the remedy.
Therefore, I say that wounds vary according to how they are made and the location on which the wound falls.
The wounds that often occur are like being struck by stones or swords cuts, or being hit with a spear, tree, or arrow, and similar things from many sources.
Wounds that occur depending on body parts are such as a ward falling over the head or neck, chest, abdamoen, and similar to other limbs.
And I shall recount the healing of certain wounds by presenting a reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple head wounds, for it is fitting that the composition will come to mind at the beginning of chapter three.
Therefore. When such an accident occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture: consider then if it is from being struck by stones or similar things, and has already broken skin only: this is a large wound, and apply warm cataplasm to the affected area immediately: do not delay that. And remove the blood outside according to its strength of quality: if there are no prohibitions against phlebotomy, especially if it is little blood coming out from the wound. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side to the wounded area.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side to the wounded area. And he should guard himself from replenishment, wine, and heavy foods.
But if something is prohibited for the patient, then lessen intake of food, and not approach meats or wine.
And place it on a wound if to him an abscess happens, either soaked with warm rose oil alone or mixed with wine that has bindings.
But if you are safe from a warm abscess, then place it on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not changed in air; after some time, put the powder that I will describe: but if the air has already affected it, then apply some ointment until healed.
But if the wound is large or from a cut with a sword, and similar; and its lips are not united by stitches, then join them together with sutures as I will describe in windpipe wounds about their suturing.
But if the wound has already been detected from bone and is hanging, and there is no retraction of it except for a small bandage; then cut into it. Then care for the ward with medicines, and restore flesh where there is hard skin; instruct the patient to eat foods that cause bulk, such as heads [of garlic], and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge; similar things.
But if you find rotting in the skin and it does not stick to bone; then cut out all the decayed part, and remove it; afterwards care for that.
But if there are arteries or a vein from which blood flows within these wounds; and it is not separated by medicines, then explore over the artery. But if you find that it is not cut, then sever it with a spatula or bandage it together. But if necessity arises when it does not yield what we have said; then burn it with a cautery until the blood separates.
But if these wounds are small and simple; then the matter of them is easy, light: so put powder on that powder: for it solidifies before changing with air.
The method for the paste of carne (meat). Recipe one part of olive oil, and two parts dragon's blood, and three unquenched lime parts: mix it all together well, and apply to the wound; cover with a good bandage until adhered properly above it, and coagulate with blood.
Then bind the ointment above; remove after a while, but do not wash until it stays in place, so that it does not move away. For this medicine must not be removed until healed.
And sometimes it makes the lime alone effective when you don't have olive oil or dragon'wart, and even dragon's blood works in this manner for many large wounds, when to place over them and bind; there are recent wounds with their own blood which do not change air.
But if the air has already changed in some way, especially when it is summer time, then this paste does not stay effective; so treat as we said by putting over it a digestive ointment: or put over it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus comes out. Then continue the rest of the treatment until healed.
If it happens that there is a break with a small wound, then extract it using leeches; and as I said before, the treatment of skull fractures will be next.
The injuries of the neck. (This would likely lead into an explanation or method for treating neck inj
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
But if it is already cut on the neck or artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no power in it unless you apply treatment that causes strong staunching, such as Zinia and Zeja, and similar things. Since worms are harmful and draw them in.
And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: for nervous substance is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is a lofty body of membranes; and it should be cared for by medicines gently, such as calcined lime mixed with sweet water infused every few times with oil or rose-scented oil, and tuthia, when washed also with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
If however the wound is large, then provide it with stitches: or close its lips with threads. Then care for it until healed.
If however the wound is deep or occurs in a sinus at its lower part where there has already been an accumulation of pus, then perforate it into a more deeply pressed place within that.
But if already incised in the wound an artery is present and its blood flow has continued: then separate it or cut off that artery, and tie up that very one; or burn it with a hot iron, if there is need for that action.
But if already the spondyles of the throat have been incised and their nerves healed: then gather together the lips of the skin with stitchangs over the jugular vein, and do not touch the throat, but rather the equal one [i.e., the tongue], and restore it to its natural form. Then bind that wound with a fitting bandage, and leave it for several days. Then care for the wound with ointments which have staunching and inflammation-reducing properties until healed.
But if the ward has already made an impression on a bone, then explore within that wound: and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all things possible from them or what you can [from] them: and that which is not prepared, let be left alone until the wound rots away, and separates and egresses.
If there is a recent wound, then apply powder on it that has been moistened with water. If however there is a bone visible in the wound, and it forms an abscess: then heal that one with the method of the chapter where its recollection comes.
§ On the spatula fracture.
If it is a blow with a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider the following method. If therefore there is discharge from the wnid, when he gasps for it and is ill from that, then know that the wound is fatal.
If however it is not deep and is recent with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bandages it so that it does not retain blood in its depth and return to the heart, but apply an attracting ointnent on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
If however the ointment is not present to you, then place an old cotton wick into the orifice of the wound so that it licks what comes out from it with moisture: and make sure he sleeps on his back over the wound so that whatever collects in it can be drawn away.
If however three days or more have passed since the wound and there is no spasm for him, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor narrowing in breathing, and you see his remaining conditions are good: then know that the wound is healed. Therefore care for him and with permission, and with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If however its healing is deferred, and it opens always: then know that a fistula has already been formed. Therefore care for it according to the chapter's method.
And if the wound is from an incision with a sword or knife, and it is simple on the chest or back surface: then care for it according to that which preceded in its suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
If it has already made an impression on the bone and broken off pieces from there: then examine the wound, and act quickly to remove those pieces if they are separated. If indeed they are not separate, then leave them alone until the wound has started to putrefy; for in fact removing those pieces should be avoided.
As for the other wounds of accidents in the remaining limbs, that judgment on their healing is the one we have mentioned.
Regarding ventral wounds and those from the intestines and their orifices.
The disruption which occurs in the abdamen is large, medium, and small.
Therefore from a major one at times comes out the intestine or multiple intestines. (Note: The original text seems to be discussing hernias and their classifications according to Albucasis' surgical observations.)
Why there is an intrusion of those, with a stronger and more difficult union. (Note: This likely refers to the challenges faced in reattaching or closing certain types of hernias as observed by Albucasis.)
And also a small rupture occurs difficultly from another way. (Note: This sentence suggests that even minor hernias can present complex challenges in surgical repair according Thus it follows that the reduction of those is more difficult if you do not hurry to bring them back to their place immediately: because they swell up and open outwards, therefore making an entry of them difficult. (Note: This refers to the urgency required in hernia repair as described by Albucasis; failing to act quickly can lead to complications due to inflammation and enlargement of the rupture site.)
For this reason a better (or less complicated) rupture of medium size occurs: because the middle one does not become difficult to reduce like those in both kinds mentioned before. (Note: The sentence is likely comparing different types of hernias and their respective challenges during surgical intervention as per Albucasis' medical expertise.)
Know that the union of a rupture occurs in four ways (Note: This statement is likely referring to the classifications of hernia repairs based on Albucasto's observations and surgical practices.)
Two common unions join in the abdominal rupture and in other wounds of the body; two other unions properly communicate with remaining wounds elsewhere. (Note: This passage seems to describe different types of surgical closures or suturing techniques as per Albucasis's experience.) However, they are more suitable with a stitch from the nostril: and I tell you one by one, with exposure, and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when a wound is full of pus and something comes out from the inside through it, making it difficult to put back together; then this is due to one of two reasons. Or because of the displacement as we said: or because there is an inflammamoent in the gut due to cold air.
Whenever this is so, then you must heat the wound, such that you immerse a sponge or a piece of wet cloth in warm water alone. Or you boil it in an infusion of pennyroyal, and galangal, and saffron, and wrap the gut with it until the swelling is resolved.
Sometimes it makes that wine which has astringency; and it is better than water alone for resolving the swelling.
Thus when you see that the inflammation has already resolved, then moisten the gut with water in which it was boiled along with a high-quality pitcher or bowl. For by this the mouth of it will be opened again to let out whatever is remaining inside.
But if there remains a passage after this treatment, then it may be due to a small displacement with the tool used to cut off hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when prepared, than cutting: and it does not force a cut after need and shortcoming of the tool.
It is a part of it that is curved, sharp-pointed and the other part not pointed, and its tip is not with delicacy similar to gauze, but rather obtuse somewhat; and it is the one which resembles clay as you see.
For when the wound is enlarged and something enters through it into the gut, then it must be reduced to its own natural shape at its own place if possible over that: for it is better.
When indeed a large rupture is on the lower part of the windpipe: then it must be made so that the patient lies on his back and raises his legs higher up to his head. And if it is in the upper part of the windpipe, then place its head and make its chest higher than its lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the windpipe, then place your aim and always keep your attention to this, so that the part where the wound is should be on the higher side than the other.
And thus it must be, that a surgeon deals with large wounds and medium wounds.
But for small wounds, place them according to what is prepared for you.
Then make it so that a good and faithful servant holds the entire rupture with his hand: and gather his lips together. Then remove from it whoever follows a stitch something after something: and this is the common method of single suture.
And it is that you take an awl or number of needles according to the amount of the width of the wound. Then dismiss from the edge of the rupture a quantity according to the length of your finger, that is, the doctor: and fix an awl except what you introduce into it thread in both ends of the skin when both ends are cut as it lies under the skin inside until you make it penetrate with the other part, and then you have gathered together two skins' edges, and two sifac edges: and four orders are made.
Then tie firmly with the thread twice around the turning of the needle several times so that both sides are gathered properly.
Then dismiss also a thickness of your finger and fix an awl on them too: then lay it with thread as you did with the first neednge. Therefore, do not cease doing that which you find among the laying-up, until you have completed the closure of the wound entirely.
And let the needles be of a medium between thickness and subtleps; for very subtle ones quickly pierce flesh, while thick ones have difficult entry into skin; therefore they should be medium both in subtlety and thickness.
And it is not necessary for the needle to be very close to both ends of the skin; so that it does not pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its healing, and also they do not elongate with the suture so as to hinder the wound's consolidation.
Then insert the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the sick person while sleeping; and put on them small pieces from cloths by all sides which hold the ends of the needles: and remove them, when you know that the wound is already consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with laying-up is more convenient for small wounds. For one or two needles suffice for that kind of suture.
The second common kind of suture is to gather the four ends: two from skin and two tips on one wick with a thread that has been spun evenly both in subtlety and thickness.
Then when you will have penetrated with the four ends of the needle, bring back the wick from the part where you first caught it to fall the thread retaken from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a suture like the one which holds cloths together in clothes, and put between all sutures the amount of thickness of little finger.
This kind of suture people know.
And with this kind of suture I healed my wound that happened to a man whose wound was cut with a knife and it was a larger tear of the skin about one hand-breadth: and had come out from intestines almost two handbreadths from midintestine, and there was disruption in the middle abdomen.
Therefore, I returned that after his intestines had stood outside for twenty-four hours near the wound.
So the wound was then consolidated after about fifteen days, and I treated it; he recovered from that, and lived for many years thereafter with his own conditions.
And the doctors judged that it could not be healed.
And by a wonder, I did not treat this with ointment. For I was at the place where no ointment nor anything from medicine could be found. So I applied twice a day over the old dressing on the ward and diligently bathed it with water mixed with honey until healed.
But two kinds of stitches I shall call according to the speech reported.
And it is as if you begin with a sharp stitch: and insert an awl from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the awl pierces through the skin and is inserted into the limb according to its length and breadth of the whole body: dismiss the pointed end into the side where you inserted the awn, and make it penetrate on the other end from the inner part to the outer in the opposite extremity.
When therefore you have made it pierce, then make it pierce according to this in the same extreme from the outer part to the inner: and dismiss the pointed end that is on this side, and make the awn penetrate into the other extreme from the inner part to the outer: and make the awl penetrate with your piercing as you do when you make it pierce through, until it has penetrated entirely into it.
Then also begin from this same side and the extreme with the pointed end that is on another side of the skin, and extract the awl from the skin that pierced it.
Then move it to that skin, and sew its extremity which is on the other side, with this extremity of a graft: take out of the skin from that part, and make one incision, and another; and make an incision after the vein, until you have completely removed all external parts according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is such that its stitches resemble those on the skins: so that you remove it with one incision from one part of the extremity of the skin: and let you remove it with another incision from the other part until completed.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen called 'nus'.
This manner of healing is described as joining it by similarity to how certain physicians do so that they join all parts according to a suitable comparison: and apply the extremity of grafting to another extremity, and the extremity of the artery to another extremity. And it is done as I have told you.
It is necessary that you make the hook near the extremity of the artery close to your external part, and let it pierce into the inside in one piece: and remove both extremities of grafting. Then roll back the hook, and let it pierce from the external part to the inside through two grafting extremities, namely each one.
Then roll back both, and also let them pierce from the inside to the outside through two arterial extremities on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is a better common suture than the easy one, and it is a suture that has surpassed memory retention.
This therefore is also the discourse of Galen.
And some have said. The suture of a vein with two hooks should be corrected. What is done is that you insert into both one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is near to you, and make it penetrate until the other side, according to the stitching of their skins which follow equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the windpipe: then the stitching of it is more difficult than those of the remaining places of the windpipe.
However, the judgment of a wound's treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
What is that if you reach a fresh wound with its own blood before it heals: and straighten the intestines, and their flesh, and soften the flesh; then place over the powder of those who are reddened.
What if the air has already healed the ward: then place over it some ointments that are with you present, until they make pus: and the threads fall down, and bind up the flesh, and mirra. Then attend to this wound as is the care of other wounds, until it heals.
But if you do not have medicine with you, then place over it immediately, and start to extract when it begins to emit pustules: and exchange the flesh twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
For you will not find medicine with other arrangements when wounds are simple ones.
But if there are things that communicate the wound to the principal members in a lesion, then it is necessary for you to immerse linen soaked in oil of moderate warmth: and place it around the places between the groin, and under the armpits.
What if it feels pain or pustules or putrefaction in its own bowels (for this often happens) then you should make the flesh a clister with a dark, sticky wine: especially if putrefaction has already come to its intestine, and made an exiting perforation through until concavity.
And you know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and what comes from it, being subtle, is of harder healing.
But the intestine called jejunum does not sustain healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude, which comes from vessels, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its own nature to nerves.
But if what comes from the wound is peritoneum, and you can grasp it freshly: take care to return it according to your technique of evenly reducing the intestines.
But if a space has passed it and now there is a purulent or black discharge: then it must be that you bind it with a thread over the place where the darkening has occurred from it, so that bleeding does not occur. For veins and arteries are in peritoneum.
Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and place two extremities of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to relieve you by its attraction towards you, and the extraction of itself in case of peritoneal discharge, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Recollection of a wound that occurred in an intestine.
When there is a disruption in an intestine and it is small: then restoration may occur in some people: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded with his own intestine upon percussion by the lancet, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the old wound: and a Fistula was made from it, and emaciation occurred from that discharge, and windiness.
Therefore I applied a treatment until I was not involved in its healing: neither did it cease being subtle, until it was healed and the site became solidified.
After I saw the place already hardened, I feared for the weak one, as an accident had occurred on it due to a sudden illness within himself; and that accident did not happen to him from that cause. And it remained in better conditions of his own, eating and drinking, having intercourse, and entered the bath, and he continued with his regular meals.
And now some have said from the experimentalists that when an injury occurs to the intestine and it is torn: then one must be tied according to this manner. And so you shall receive headless ants. Then gather two edges of the wound and place one ant from them that has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound. When therefore its head is on it, and it clings with its mouth, detach that head of his, for it sticks and cannot be separated.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that with ants after each other according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and its wounds. For indeed these heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is eaten and healed, and does not cause deep harm to the sick person.
And now it is possible for one to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: that which has been removed from the intestine of animals, attached together after being inserted into the anus.
And it is so that you shall receive the end of this thread from the intestiopathy, and be stretched out much. Then tie at the end of its thread a woundless fine line. Then insert that thread into the anus and with it his intestine. Then reduce it to a commotion.
And this method of stitching with ants and the intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, extensive, especially if it is on a slender part of the intestines: then there is no remedy but delicate treatment, and its healing at all is not possible.
Regarding the care for pilonidal cysts and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess when it ages and becomes old, turns into an ulcer, does not heal, and constantly emits pus without ever separating: then universally in whatever part of the body it was, it is called a Fistula, and we name it Zuchemen.
And indeed the Fistula is a truly scrotal filtration, hard and white: with which there is no pain, like down feathers: and because of this some call it Risatio, that is, pen.
And it occurs at certain times wet, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture separates at certain times. And sometimes this moistereness is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is fine.
And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that all ulcers which do not heal and are born into the body, there is none of them but because of one out of nine causes.
One of these is because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or due to its illness; or because between it and above its lips there is a hard meat that prevents birth: or since it has many dirtinesses and sordities; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that emits from it is of bad quality: or because medicine does not agree in its treatment:n or because there is a falling corruption in the region which is a type of pestilence due to its characteristic as happened in Caesaraugusta: where there are difficult digestions of illnesses, and healing is delayed by nature in apostemas; or because it has one bone, or several bones.
And I have already shown you all those causes and signs of them, and the treatments for each with medicines in division; and here it is necessary to make you know the treatment of Fistulas and Piles, which is done through a channel by hand surgery.
Therefore, you must know that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body. For there are fistulas that come to large veins and arterries or nerves or ducts; or to the intestine or bladder or from some of the ribs; or from some of the dorsal spines; or from a composite joint structure: such as hands, feet; and there are those which approach the proximity of primary limbs and their similarities.
Therefore, of these fistulas, there is one in this manner, which comes from difficult diseases to heal and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it requires great effort and knowledge.
But if it is of some fistulas whose depth has not reached these places that I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in the healing of its treatment, and wish to achieve knowledge of it, then take a trial from iron or bronze, if the fistula proceeds with straightness, and treat it with itself.
But if there is twisting in a faster, then investigate it with trials of fine lead. For since the softness of lead is taken away by its own malleability, and treated around the twisting.
And if a faster has many openings, it is not possible for you to distinguish upon it with trials. Therefore, filter out of them an opening from their own openangs.
For the moisture with which you filter it flows towards other openings and runs through them.
Then precisely investigate as follows how it may be possible for you to know: whether what is there is a bone or nerve and that the fistula is either long-standing or close by; or if it is one fistula with many openings, and covers the whole of it with great strength of yours: with your questioning as when inquiring about an afflicted person, and finding pain through compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidental occurrences.
Therefore, when you stand over all of those true positions, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is, as you consider at that time, if there is a Fistula near or in a place safe but far from the joints, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you about. Then cut the Fistula according to what has been mentioned above in my narration, and remove what is in it due to filtration, and rotten flesh, which is born at its opening from flesh or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
However, if the Fisture is deep and straight, then it must be cut deeply as much as possible for you. Then cleanse it with all the rotten flesh of its own.
Then apply honey-soaked linen to the wound and insert it up to the depth of the Fisture that you enclosed with a knife: do this several times until the acute medicine has completely covered what remains in the concavity of the Fisture from rotting.
Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
However, if it does not heal by this, then burn it as we have mentioned.
If the cause of the Fisture is a bone and it appears to be there for you: then examine it, and cut it as I have told you, unless something prohibits you from doing so due to a vein, or nerve, or main limb, just as we mentioned.
If a bone is found by you and there is some rotting and blackness on it, then scrape it off until the entire rotting is removed. Then care for it with what makes skin cover it, until it heals.
If it does not heal and emits pus as before, then you know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the infection.
Therefore, remove it a second time and carefully examine its reason and cleanse itself with your utmost strength.
Then restore it. If then it heals, it is good; and if not, then you know that the decay is in a very distant part of the body, which you are not connected to. Therefore, it is not your skill involved unless you allow nature itself.
If the bone of the palate is decayed, and it is possible for you to do so, draw out with subtle pincers that correspond to it.
But if there are many bumps, then carefully perform an extraction of all of them and do not remove anything with your strength.
If however something hinders you from the moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in them: then incise those moistures and flesh if they are there, and release the bones.
If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place over the wound what is decaying and let it out; and expel that which has become putrid around those bones from flesh and moisture.
And guard the wound so that it does not harden. And compress the section which you secured in your procedure. Indeed place over it if possible, submerged swine's lard beaten with vinegwart: or submerged oil of Egypt, or any green ointment.
For when those moistures indeed separate from the bones, let there be removal of them, and their extraction.
But if there is a large bone like the thigh bone or hip bone and similar to it, and what has been decayed from it is a great part: then remove that with the last reason until that blackness and decay is taken out. Then he restores the fracture.
If indeed there is something rotten in it and the part is large and the decay has reached the bone marrow, then it must be cut open entirely to where the rot has progressed; then care for it until it solidifies.
And I tell you a parable about what happened to the man in his own body: place that example and help over your surgery.
There was a young man of about thirty years whose body experienced pain in the limb, caused by something that moved within it, namely, from the inside until materials reached the leg and there was a large abscess. And for him there was no external cause.
Therefore he lasted long with this thing due to the error of doctors until the abscess was opened, and many materials gathered on him at once. And the care for him was left until a cavity had formed in his leg, and many openings were made therein: all these things released pus and body fluids.
Thus it was cared for by a multitude of doctors for about two years, and there was not in him wisdom in the art of hand until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were running out from those many openings: even the entire body of man had rotted, and the color of his skin was yellowish.
Therefore I entered with a probe into one of those openings and it reached to the mouth (of the cavity).
Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were coming out against him from all parts of his leg.
I therefore desired it and followed up one of those openings until I extracted a part of the bone: and found that it was rotten: which had already corroded, darkened, putrified, and pierced through until it penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore, I made a saw that was discovered and prepared from putrefied bone.
And I assigned it [the piece], which there was no such thing as a portion of the bone except that putrefaction, and cut off and made a saw. And I have already uprooted it.
Then I applied the healing of the wound with well-consolidated medicines for a long time. And it is not solidified.
Then I tried again and removed the bone above the first discovery: and found continuous putrefaction with the bnne; and a saw appeared to me also from that putrefaction.
Then I attempted its healing. And it is not restored.
Therefore, I removed again from it [the bone], and did not stop to cut the bone in particular parts, and tried its healing: and it is not restored until I cut about a span of one hand from the bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Then I healed it with medicines, and quickly solidified, and healed it: and this repetition was not necessary for its operation, and cutting of itself, except because of the disposition of the debilitated patient, and the small tolerance of his body, and my fear over him concerning death; for in all hours from excessive purging caused a syncopal fall.
Therefore, he was completely cured by his healing: and a hard bone-flesh has been born in the place of the bone, and made good arrangement in its body, and returned strength to it; and turned back into his usual dispositions: and caused him no harm at all in walking.
If however a prominent bnne already has been broken in the place of the body: then it is appropriate that you cut it off, according to this manner; and it is as follows: as if you receive a sash [ligament], and bind it tightly at the tip of the prominent bone: and command someone to stretch it upwards: and lay another ligament from coarse woolen rope. Then bind the tendon over the meat that is attached to the bone; and extend its extremity so as to draw the flesh downward; and you reveal the flesh over the place where you wish to fasten it, in order not to damage the serrated flesh.
Then place a piece of wood or board underneaturally the bone below; for when you do this, it does not prevent rotten flesh from being cut out.
And it is necessary that the serrated part be placed just above the spot of decay so as not to be deeply within the rotten bone; and it does not appear in its own vision, and prevents the use of another serration.
If the bone is decayed and not prominent, but continues with a part of it; and if the decay is within it or on its own part: then remove the flesh from all sides completely. Then place wood below.
Afterwards cut that part of the serration where there is decay until it continues on another side; and let the second serration be as close to the length of the decayed area as we have said.
If the decay is at a joint, cut off the rotten joint and serrate on the bone that continues on another side.
However, if the decay is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no injury to it except scraping away.
If the decay is on a hand or foot blade, then the condition there is very difficult indeed. However, you must examine how the decay appears to you. And scrape it off and smooth the same as much as possible by any means at your disposebody; when it does not cause you contrary to a Vein or Nerve.
And you should know that these incisions and serrations for cutting bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their fineness, and their size, and the degree to which they yield, and their hardness, and their rareness. Therefore, it is necessary for one to prepare an appropriate instrument for each type of surgery.
And you know that these surgerangs require a specific choice of instrument with which you are familiar, especially if your experience is extensive. And knowledge of the ways of this art, testimony to types of diseases: then you will find for yourself what is suitable from instruments for every ailment.
And I affirm to you the final number of instruments mentioned in this chapter and give examples on which to focus your practice, as well as testing with other tools.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of joined scissors. The head of this pair of scissors should be shaped like the head of a star thorn: and its points should be according to the shape of Elishafeng's points.
And it does not suit unless they rub together with the heads of the scissors when they are corroded or large and broad.
Shape of larger pair of scissors.
Shape of wide pair of scissors.
Shape of a pair of scissors with concave heads.
Shape of another subtle pair of scissors.
Shape of another pair of scissors with a hooked handle.
Shape of small, subtle-handled pair of scissors.
This is like a rasp, with its end shaped like a saw; it should be displayed for many places by reason of bones.
The shape of the razor that fits to its reason because it is pierced through bones.
Its end is triangular and sharp at the ends.
It comes from India. And similarly, it should be made as we have described with razors, and saws, and scissors.
§ On cutting the ends and nailing of bones.
The ends rot away due to an external or internal cause.
Therefore, if the doctor has been sickened by that decay and does not apply medical treatment and does not see the decay affecting the limb to which nothing is applied: then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the spread of decay occurs so that the weak one may avoid death or a greater defect in the member.
And the sign of which is that the limb darkens until thought to be dead; it has been burnt by fire or has decayed after blackening: then this putrefaction cuts up to where it follows the limb and creeps through the entire body.
Therefore, when it has been cut off and similarly if the cause of decay is from some venomous things such as sea scorpions, adder-heads, blister beetles, and similar ones.
If the decay or impact is on the end of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave space for the spread of decay so that it may be incised up to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens on a hand, then cut off that hand from the root of the elbow and do not leave space for the spread of decay until it reaches into the cubital fossa.
And if it invades that one, then cut off the arm near the elbow at its joint.
But if the decay passes through and you see it around the elbow: then there is death to that patient. And in addition to this from treatment, there is a quantity of strength.
Similarly, do so with the foot when there is a corruption in the finger, then make an incision near one of the knots; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then make an incision along the entire foot. However, if it rises to the knee, then make an incision near the joint of the knee.
Which if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it, unless release, and to leave the sick person to die.
And the way of making an incision or cutting the limb is to stretch the lower tendons which you intend to cut; and stretch another tendon above the place. And extend one servant ligament towards below: and extend another servant ligament upwards from above. And you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a wide spatulum until all the meat is revealed. Then make an incision or cut.
And it is necessary to place a linen strip from all the parts of the skin, and that it does not touch the healthy joint: and if there be an additional injury to the sick person, and hot suppuration.
However, if there is an internal bleeding while you work on it, then quickly cauterize the place or put some powders that stop the blood over it. Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a corresponding ligament and care for it, until it heals.
And I tell you about what happens to a man in his own foot, this same thing that I told you about.
Which is because it happens as a redness in his own foot with an erosion that resembles the burning of fire; and this corruption first happens in his finger until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Therefore, a man took care of himself after he saw the corruption set in on his limb with great weakness, which he found from pain and burning; and it happened at the joint, and was healed.
And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption occurred on his thumb of the hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to recover the excess from him with what I had applied to his hand after cleansing his body; but the excess was not found, and it began to occur on another finger: until a corruption occurred on his hand.
Therefore, he called me to set his hand; and I did not want to do that, hoping for the excess from him to be found with me: and also feared death upon him at the cutting of his hand. For the man's strength was greater than the matter.
But after he had given up on me, he returned to his land; and came to me because of that, and his hand was entirely severed: but he was healed.
And I did not bear this story unless it be help for that which falls from the nature of this sickness; and that it may have significance as signified, and according to how it is done.
Of the care of sinuses, and the quality of clysters with medicines.
When an abscess occurs on certain fleshly members and continues for a space of time until it forms a collection of pus; then it breaks out or is perforated, and that which was in there comes forth from the sore: and the skin above remains like a cloth already thinned out: and healing did not reach to its end in corruption, nor impressed on bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it should be called Sinus; and is not called Fistula. But if the space of that extends until the corruption impresses on something from among those members, then it is named a Fistula or Zuken.
And its treatment is to incise the skin completely as it heals; especially when it becomes thin and spreads like cloth; and trust that it does not adhere with the bone because of its decay.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and not result from that final decay; and if there is thickness in the flesh of the skin, then treat it with an enema; and consider applying a compress.
Then if it is large and pus is emitted from it with foul odor; then enema the wound with an Egyptian medicine consisting of equal parts vinegar, oil, and zinziri, which are mixed into a bag: and boil them on fire until they turn red, and let them come to the thickness of honey.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the wound with that medicine for an interval of two hours; and tighten the opening, and discharge the medicine into it at a quantity equal to two hours' time.
Then extract from it with expression for so many days until the wound is cleansed and the odor disappears.
And occasionally enema it with water and ashes when this medicine is not present to you; and take the ash of willow twigs or oak wood shavps: and pour water over it. Then cool it with that, and enema the wound with it until you trust that the wound is already washed out.
But if the patient cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, then enema the wound with water and honey mixed with some of the crushed zinziri. Or enema the wound with honey and wine mixed together since of the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash; and make the wine adhere to the wound, especially when there is an excess of spitting power and dryness in it.
Whenever you do this and with clysters because the sinus corruption has already been removed, then cleanse it as such that meat is born from it.
And it is that you receive from the dyafinicum ointnment: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the sinus opening is tight, into which a clyster tube does not enter: then enlarge it with iron slightly: or place into it soaked linen in an Egyptian ointnment, or in a Basilicum ointment, until it has been widened.
And similarly if it is also a wide opening, then join its lips with suture: and let the quantity taken from there be used for making clysters without any additions.
And similarly if the opening from which a discharge runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it off at the lower part that is there, so that the discharge runs out through it downwards; for when the pus is constricted deep within the sinus, it prevents meat from forming in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus about lower towards which way you wish: then try as best you can to prepare the member with preparation by means of which a discharge flows out from there easily according to what is prepared for you. And try as best you can that nothing at all remains within it from the discharge; and take solidifying medicines which are indicated on the signs, suitable to what is desired by you. And extend them over a linen cloth. And let the linen cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the whole sinus. Then incise with scissors along the opening of the sinus's aperture, slightly wider than the opening of the sincus itself. Then extend the ointment lumps onto another piece of cloth according to the amount of openings: and place it on top far away from the sinus opening so that the pus may be drawn out from there: and do not remove the large cloth too quickly, but after a few days only.
But he who is above the sinus opening, he whom you remove every hour so that what accumulangs in it from pus may flow out: and to know, whether the thing that comes out of there is much or little; digested or undigested.
And when you again consider the location of that sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there or not; and whether there is a sore or not in it.
Thus when your treatment is stretched out in this manner and you see the matter that flows out over the sinus opening, then know if the sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion: then accordingly loosen it in the morning or on the third day: and when you unbind a sore, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
But if a long and subtle virus flows out from the sinus, do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are men who delay tissue generation in their sores, and among them are those who act otherwise about it.
But if a long and subtle virus flows out from the sine after many days of undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
But if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then add more drying agents as such; make sure that there are enough moist medicines for them to be wet by nature, and dry by their power: like dyafinicon ointment, when added with an excess of substance from wax.
And from this, when he is treated more extensively, it is so that you receive the diaphinic unguent, and dissolve it with rose oil, and stirred over an old wine equal to its nature.
Then make of it [the poultice], as such, use it.
And now you do a similar to this action, when the diaphinic unguent is not present with you [at hand], honey; when you cook it, until it swells, and use it as such. Or receive [myrrh], and aloe, and frankincense; break the whole thing into pieces, and pulverize it over honey while it is on fire. Then place the thread over it [the wound], and bind the bandage over Shadon; and place the honey that you have cooked until it swells, and sprinkle it over the pieces, and put them on top of the fabric, and tie the bandage onto it.
And sometimes it is administered with that [long-leaved] aristolochia and the roots of the heavenly lily and onion; and flour of a plant, and cornflower. Use them with simple [remedies], or combined ones; crush it and the same sieve, and sprinkle it over honey that you have prepared, and use it as such.
If the wound continues and is not healed by this treatment: then you know that there is a deep-seated [infection] in it; or now it has made an impression on bones, or other hard limbs, or ligaments: then treat it with a method of Fistulas, as previously mentioned.
Of the treatment of Panaretus and worn nail, and incision on an added finger, and cutting [the tissue].
Panaretus is an abscess that arises under the thumb of hand or foot; and perhaps it may arise on other fingers.
Therefore, when the matter of its wound is prolonged and neglected in care and exposed to warm moisture, it becomes corrupt or discharges pus until it destroangs the root of the nail; and perhaps it may become entirely rotten, and perhaps the rot may reach the mouth, until a foul odor emanates from it; and its extremity becomes wide, and its color turns dark.
Therefore, when you care for it as we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary that you cut out with a knife all the excessive matter remaining from the nail. Then burns (cauterizes) the wound after that. For indeed, cautery is very useful for them all.
But if the bone is sound and the nail also healthy, and the dry additions of the nail are already compressing the flesh towards the interior, and they begin to prick it, and injure it: then one must place a subtle radium under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and press it upwards; and cut away the flesh with ease, and put over what remains from the flesh burned medicines, corrosives, until it is entirely removed. Then care for that with ointments until it heals.
But if the rot already imprints on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract the matter: for it does not heal at all as long as there remains rottenness in it.
But if you see erosion and rottennamenews to be advancing on the finger, then cut it off at a node as mentioned earlier. Then care for that until it heals.
But if there happens to be abrasion of the nail or a blow: and it causes intense pain, then one must first draw blood from the sick person. Then she cuts a piece of wax with an obliquely sharp spatula across from below to above the eye.
And guard so that the incision does not reach the flesh undernehemal wax, for it may happen with great pain to the patient through this injury and cause additional body tissue growth at the site.
Then care for the place so that it calms pains.
Yet the finger that is added which grows on certain people's hands, maybe it is all flesh; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps it has a wax-like substance: and some of them grow at the root joint, or its growth occurs on some knots of the finger. Therefore the one that grows on certain finger knots does not move: and the one that is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps it moves.
Thus the one among them that is fleshly, its incision is easy. What I mean to say: as you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However the treatment of the one whose growth is at the joint's root is difficult. Therefore beware of incision on it.
Yet for the one that grows in a finger among the last knots, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone. Then scrape the bone with a single of those scrapers appropriate for that purpose. Then care for it until it is healed.
Yet the solidification that occurs on fingers' tips often happens from birth with it, or from wound healing, or burning with fire, and similar things.
Therefore you should cut off that solidification until the finger returns to its natural shape. Then place between them linens dipped in rose oil: so that they do not solidify quickly, and separate them: or put between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is healed according to what it should be.
And similarly, if such a hardening occurs with certain fingers along with the palm, then cut off that hardening, according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the body part.
On Surgical Errors.
These are distended veins which occur with excessive melancholamoia in many body parts; and most of the event occurs in legs, especially in legs used for walking and working, and carrying loads.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer body friction from black cholera several times through vigorous rubbing.
Then the leech should latch onto those veins of the patient's basilic (arm).
However, the cure for these is in two ways with iron. One of them involves cutting and extracting black blood. And the other method is to drain the vein and remove it entirely.
The cutting of that (vein) is according to this method. First wet the leg with warm water a lot until the thick and dirty blood dissolves. Then tightly bandage that leg from its upper thigh area to the lower part of the knee with strips. Next cut (the leech) off at a single place or two places, or three wide sections.
Then drain (the blood), that is, extract the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg to the upper and first attach leeches to the patient. Then cut off the skin with its lower part: until a quantity of blood sufficient to what you see is expelled and as much can be endured by the patient's strength.
Then bind the wound and instruct him to refrain from foods that generate black cholera: and repeat evacuations and leeching when veins fill up, and if it bothers the patient.
The leeching however is done according to this manner. Then apply a dressing if there are many hairs on it. Then insert the fat into a bath: or prick the flesh with a hot needle while in contact with warm water until it turns red and swells, or exercise vigorously if there is no available bath, until the limb warms up.
Then dry the skin directly on either side of the veins along their length: or at its end near the knee, or at the lower part by the heel.
Then open the skin with a hook and remove the veins from all sides until they are visible; and at their appearance, you see them turning red to blackish color. Thus when it comes out of the skin, you see it white as a string.
Then insert under that radius until when leeching and coming out of the skin; hang it with a clean hook gently.
Then dry another incision close to the first one by three fingers. Then scrape away the skin from above part of the vein until it is visible. Then leech with radii as you did first; and hang it with another hook as you did initially.
Then dry another incision or several if required. Then leech and cut the same final incision near the heel.
Then extract it from the incision above that one.
And do this until you extract it from the incision above or all higher cuts when they come out entirely; then cut them.
If however it does not yield to be extracted and leeched: then insert a needle with a strong thread twice, tie it off, and extract it; or insert under that radius; and relax your hand over all parts until it comes out. And let it heal, so as not to cut again. For if it is cut, then it will be very difficult for you to completely heal it, and harm will come from the injury itself.
Therefore, when you have removed it completely: then place a cloth soaked in wine and rose oil (or oil) over the wound, and care for it until healed.
If the vein is twisted, having a tortuosity that requires an extension into different parts, and it is not like we said according to straightness: then you must make cuts over its entire tortuous part, and the locations of the extensions themselves.
Then suspend it with a hook until completely healed: and let the surgical cuts heal without being reopened or injured again; for it will be very difficult to heal them or remove them. Therefore, use your caution.
The form of the incident in which a vein is cured.
The form of blinding hooks (cauterization).
It is not as thin or sharp as other hooks, nor does it have acute tips that could reopen wounds; and it has a thick flexibility, softness: because if it were subtle, its own subtlenebility would cause the wound to reopen: indeed let there be an excess of bulkiness on it, as we said.
Regarding the removal of a leg vein.
This vein is found on the legs in hot lands like Elisegi and Arabian territories, as well as on dry, somewhat warm lands where not a single plant or tree grows.
And perhaps it arises in other places of the body besides the legs.
And indeed the occurrence of this vein is due to decay that happens underneteh skin, like how it occurs inside bodies with snakes and ascarids worms, and worms born between skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of this vein's event is that it occurs with intense inflammaturation within the muscle. Then, the bleeding point. Then begins the vein to exit from that place of bleeding, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
When it then appears from that end of it, one should insert over the same piece of lead weighing as much as a keil-drachm up to two drachms and its length: and remove the suspended lead from the muscle.
As often as it then proceeds something to the exterior, insert that into lead and its length. If it is prolonged much, then incise that part of it, and insert the remainder. And do not cut its root until it has emerged entirely. For if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh; and makes a bleeding occur, and decay in place, and a bad sore.
Therefore it must be gently handled and drawn out gradually, until it leaves from its end completely, and nothing remains of it in the body: and this vein emerges in some humans that is in length five spans and ten. And now comes to me because he has come out from twenty spans.
But if you have incised yourself at the time of your medical treatment: then insert a rod into its hole and perforate it through the hole long, with the body, until that completely evacuates which is in it from material: and administer decay to place with medicinal days for some. Then care for itself at treating of sores.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of foot, or on the foot itself: and there occur to it many holes, and a branch comes out from every hole.
Therefore, take care of it as we have discussed in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
Regarding the section on worms generated under the skin, which is called Bouin'tise.
This disease is called Bouintise in a certain land among us; therefore, because it often happens to oxen and consists of a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it proceeds through the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to affect the sensation during its movement from limb to limb until it ruptures wherever it bursts into the skin, and emerges.
And its generation comes from the decay of certain fluids. Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in urine.
And it fears from its evilness. Because when it proceeds through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place; then perhaps it opens up there, and emerges, and destrocks an eye: and this often happens.
Therefore, when one takes care of it, and extracts it, then that is not done except during its movement, and the appearance itself of its sensation.
One should therefore hold tight what is above it, and what is below it with a strong binding pressure. Then dry over it, and extract it.
If it is deeply embedded in the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a caustic over that spot with fire until it dies.
And greater still is its decay, which ruins the eye, as we have said.
But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then tightly tie underneath a strong ligature on the eyebrow. Then cut above it and extract [it].
And one must use a sick person'score self-cleansing with medicines that dissolve foul and bad bodily fluids.
And he should beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
§ On cutting above the sickness Nakir.
This illness is called Nakir on our land: it is pain that occurs in certain limbs; and then it moves from one limb to another.
And indeed I have seen this myself, as you told me. Called to a sick woman in certain villages. And she extracted her arm, and I saw swelling like honeycombs on the line of the arm.
And after I stayed for an hour, I saw one swelling advance like a waxing with jets, as it ascends to her arm faster than it can be: so that it is like silver moving from place to place.
Therefore the pain receded from that place and settled on the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body as I had seen.
Therefore I wondered about the rapidity of its movement from limb to limb. And indeed I myself had not seen this kind of sickness with my eyes in such a way before. But I did see many others who find pain moving from limb to limb: and I did not see this with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that is the case, but because she was from those who are coming out of parched bodies with wounds: hence therefore it appears to be a change of air movement.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are pleasing and in moist bodies of hidden veins.
Therefore, when you apply this treatment and the patient feels that pain: if it appears to your eye as we said, then tighten above it, and below immediately: cut on top of it quickly, until that swelling is drawn back; and cauterize the spot.
If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it by rubbing the body, and that which expels swellings, and compresses them with loathsome pills, and serepta-like pulses, and similar ones.
§ On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their kinds and the places where they fall from the body.
Their variety is such: for there are some that have large points, and small ones: and hollowed, and deafened. And there are some which have three angles. And there are those which have tongues. And there are some that have stars.
However, those that fall into certain limbs, it is in two ways. Or indeed the limbs are from major parts hollowed out, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones. Whenever one of these limbs falls and you see signs of death which I will tell you after this, then it is necessary for you to avoid extracting that arrow from them, since death follows the place where it is located, by many dispositions. And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Therefore, when a person is hit by an arrow that penetrates the skull and exits through the top of the head (which lies above the brain), these symptoms occur: because of this, there are intense pains, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of thoughts, and vomiting due to cholera. And perhaps blood may exit through the nostrebs or ears. And speech may be severed, and voice destroyed. And a whiteness like lime may exit from the wound site. And there is an exudation similar to moist flesh.
However, if these signs appear to you, then refrain from healing it and extract the arrow only if it does not exit on its own.
The signs of an arrow hitting the heart are as follows: that is near the left nipple; and it feels as if it is fixed to something hard, not to something soft. And perhaps the arrow moves like a pulse movement: and black blood runs from the wound. Then follows that coldness of limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting spells. Know then that death is close by no doubt.
And the sign of an arrow hitting the lung is that frothy blood exits from the wound: and thin things follow it on the neck, spreading out, and changing to a pale color of the sickly. And there is a large, deep breath; and seeks cold air attraction.
If the arrow falls on the casing (which is in the chest): then it is close to bare ribs: and there is a large short breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all limbs move tremulously.
If the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested food will exit from the wound.
And if an arrow falls into the abdab, and becomes fixed therein: something of feces comes out from the wound, or a splinter, or entrails that are already torn apart. Therefore, there is no hope for his healing, nor for extracting the arrow.
If an arrow falls into the bladder and discharges urine: and something proceeds to the outside, with stronger pain in the afflicted person: then you know that it is fatal.
However, the remaining parts such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, palate, arms, cervical vertebrae, shoulder blades, hip bones, legs, and similar limbs are saved according to several dispositions when it is not found that an arrow has reached an artery or nerve: and it is not a venomous arrow.
And I tell you what I have seen of these kinds of arrows that signify by means of your healing.
Which is, because a certain man was struck with an arrow in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose. Therefore, I extracted it from one side under the fatty part of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to him in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell on him in the fatty part of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow had already been hidden, and I did not extract anything except a small scale of it that was attached to its wood: and it was a large arrow like those used by Turkish archers, made with soft iron, without ears.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no harm befell him in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
And it was an Arabian arrow, and it is the kind that has ears. Therefore I stitched it between the two guides: and it was already submerged into his throat. So I carefully handled it until I removed it: and he, a Christian, was healed.
And I extracted another arrow that had fallen into his belly: and we thought it would die from this.
Afterward, however, for him passed thirty days, and nothing changed about him from his conditions, so I stitched over the arrow: and healed it with skill, and extracted it: and he was hewed, and no misfortune happened to him.
And I saw the men whose back had an arrow wound: and it was healed over that wound. Afterward, however, after seven years, an arrow came out of his hip joint.
And I saw a woman whose belly had an arrow wound, and it was healed over that ward; and the arrow remained within her: and nothing changed from her conditions, and she found no harm to him through any of her natural processes.
And I saw another man whose face had an arrow wound; and it was healed, but the arrow remained, not finding him much pain: and like these many similar things.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's leaders, which had fallen into his nose; and it was already leaning slightly toward the right side: and the arrow was wholly hidden.
I was called to heal him after the arrow incident for three days. And I found a wound from an arrow that was very narrow.
So I carefully tried to probe it, and did not feel it; but he himself found bleeding and pain on the right side of his ear. So I hoped that was a perforation from the arrow's tip.
Therefore, I placed the plaster with the emplastros where the attraction and digestion were present, confident that the place was targeted, and it appeared to me as a sign of an arrow, so I cut above it: and nothing happened at the location intended to signify that an arrow had struck the spot.
Therefore, I applied the emplastros on it for many days: and nothing happened unexpectedly, and the wound was healed in the meanteby: and remained weak from the extraction of that time until he sensed an arrow one day within his nostrils. And he told me about it.
And he told me about it. Therefore, I placed an acute and caustic medicine on that wound for many days until it was open, and when I tried to touch it myself, and felt the slight point of an arrow attached to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that acute medicine until we could visibly see the point of the arrow: and it passed for me from him a period of about four months.
Then, after the wound had been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield exit: then I did not cease delicately and skillfully trying ways of ingenuity on it until one day with properly made forceps, according to how the shape of them comes in the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not repairable. Therefore I restored it and the wound was healed and the patient's health was completely intact: nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: place that rule and significance over what I did not say.
Since the parts and distinabtions of this art are not comprehended with the narration: neither does that book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares little to much: and what is absurd, he compares to what is absent; and in doing so, he found a new operation and a new instrument for the descent of foreign bodies in this art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit from the members with which they are embedded unless by two ways. Or through attraction from the place it entered. Or conversely, parts of another.
And that which exits where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshy area: and it is attracted and exits.
That if it does not obey the exit at the hour when it falls: then one must cast it away for several days until the flesh around it decays: and its attraction is reduced and its exit occurs.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not obey you for the exit, then cast it away also for several days: and touch it daily with attraction and movement on every day until its exit occurs.
That if it does not obey you for the exit after days, then one must pierce around the path of the arrow in that bone from every side with a subtle drill until the arrow is enlarged. Then attract it and extract it.
However, if the arrow is already concealed within the body and hidden from sense: then search for it with probes. However, if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that suit its traction.
However, if you cannot get over it due to the constriction of the wound and because of the depth of the arrowhead and there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then find above it, until the wound enlarges, and as far as possible extracting the arrow.
That if there are ears that hold it fast, then liberate the fixed flesh from all sides by every means you can, and instruments, if it cannot be brought above the injury of a broken or twisted ear, until he flees.
And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place where it is, then use your hand's contortion with scissors to all parts until he flees: and by subtlety lastly, so that the arrow does not break, and makes difficult its attraction and extraction.
That if you cannot get over it at once, then let it go for several days until what is around him becomes putrid. Then repeat it: for if the blood flow causes you trouble, then administer what we have said from healing in its chapter: and guard your strength from injury of veins, nerves or cords.
And administer the instrument in every way you can for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, delay, firmness, as I have narrated to you.
And you must make it so that when drawing the arrow, the patient is weakened according to its shape, as was during the case of the arrow wound itself. Since there are more pains. But if it is not possible for you to do that, then give what you can from the patterns.
The arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, or is already causing something on the outside: it makes swelling at the extremity of the arrow due to a sense from the nearby upper skin; and you see it protruding: cut above it, and let the incision be according to the amount that hands can hold in it.
Then pull on it; for it is indeed easier for an exit.
But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow impresses into the beak, and enlarges itself: then pull on it.
And if not: discharge it for a few days; then repeat it until it exits.
But if the arrow's wood is in that area, then push on it with that.
But if the wood falls and you need to apply a push: then insert an instrument with a hollow end so that it can enter into the tail of the arrow: then push on it with that.
But if the arrow is hollow, then push on it with an entering instrument. The arrow indeed is removed by this.
For if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary for you to make a hollow all through the flesh wherein is the venom, if possible for you. Then take care of it with what suits that matter.
For if the arrow falls into the heart, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is near what you touch with your hand when you try to do that, and possible for you to cut above it: then cut above it, and cauterize from the incision of the vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then examine the wound, if possible, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of Forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
The ends are like an eagle's beak, crafted as if of iron: when they catch the arrow above it, they do not release it.
And many kinds are made from them, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its penetration depth, the width of the wound, and its tightness.
The shape of a lever is concave.
And the shape of a lever is convex.
This is like the end of the radius, to be inserted into the concave arrow, and pushed together with it.
§ On venipuncture.
The points to be punctured for venipuncture, of which it is customary practice on the body, are thirty.
Of which on the head are sixteen: two Pulse Veins, called post-ear veins; two Herb Veins (veins near the temples); two Arteries, visible between the temples; two Eyebrow Veins, situated in front of each eye and named Aspikents; a prepared Vein on the forehead; and a Vein at the tip of the nose. And two Jugular veins, which are located on the neck. And two Veins that are situated above the upper lip of the mouth. And two Veins that are located below the lower lip of the mouth. And these are Veins called Algerrichs. And two Veins that are situated under the tongue.
The veins which are punctured for venipuncture on both arms are five per arm.
One is cephalic and is from the silvery side; and the common people call it vein of the head. And black. It is a middle vein and is composed of branches from the basilica and cephalic; the common people call it the body's vein. And it is called the basilica, and is located on the domestic side; it is also named Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of winds. And it is called the funis brachii, and is located above the armpit; that is where bloodletting occurs, and it is also the one that appears prominently with thumb movement.
And Salutaresia: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and little finger; there are two branches to it.
And there are three veins in the leg and foot. One of them is under the curve of the thumb from the silvery side. And the second one is Saphene, and its location is near the heel on the domestic side. And it is a vein of Nessus, and its location is near the heel from the silvery side.
And there are three similar veins on the other leg.
§ Of bloodletting from two veins after the ears.
However, the bloodletting from two veins that are after the ears is for old coughs, and hemicrania, and sore throat, and ancient head ulcers.
And the quality of bloodletting her as I will describe. It is done to the head of the sick person: and it rubs gently his occiput at the place where the two veins are with a piece of rough cloth for good scraping. Then the sick person binds their neck with bandages until they appear as two veins. And the locations of those are after the ears, on lower places of the head in two places. Therefore ask for those veins with your finger, and where you feel a pulsation under your finger, there mark with wax.
Then take the lancet called Incisor. Then insert a sponge under the skin, until it reaches with the lanclete to the mouth (vein). Then use your hand with a sponge and skin towards the upper part, and cut the vein together with the incision made by Incisor. And let the length of the incision be equivalent to two fingerbreadths or about that amount; and make it exit through blood as you wish.
Then tighten it with bandages, and let it go until healed.
And now the first part of the book has passed concerning cutting these veins and their cauterization.
However, the two arteries that are in both temples for phlebotomy have benefit to old headaches: and frequent sweating, and persistent otitis; and discharge of hot fluids into the eyes.
And the quality of performing it is as follows as I inform you. The sick person should tightly bandage their neck until two veins appear clearly to the sense of sight; and it shows pulse under your finger. Then mark with wasters.
Then use a sponge on the vein to the upper part with your index finger, and insert an incision undernephesisthe lancet, and use a sponge on the vein again to the upper part. And cut it as you did with other two veins; and let it run out of blood according to your need.
Then loosen the bandage on the sick person, and place your finger over one of the veins for a while. Then place a bandage and poultices on it, and wrap the wound tightly with a strong binding; release it once healed.
And now follows the recollection of those, their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
However, the bloodletting bandage on the forehead is after cephalic bloodlettning: for ancient diseases of the face; and headache; and redness; and foul sores.
And the nature of that bloodletting is as I have told you. A sick person should tie their neck with a poultice until the bandage appears. Then take an instrument called Fossa.
Place a prominent point that is on the head of Fossa above the bandage and strike over it with a comb or with another tool in its manner; and release blood running according to the amount you wish. Then dissolve the puncture of the sick person, and bind it tightly until healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide bloodletting. However, it should not be a sharp bloodletting as the others are; but rather one of wide extremities at its base. And the bloodletting is as follows: for the mouth is close by; and perhaps it breaks when the bloodletting is fine.
However, the bloodletting bandage of two Veins that are on two Lacrimals for both eyes is for an itch and redness; and within the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the nature of that bloodletting is as a sick person should tie their neck with a poultice. Then use a fleam and stand over his head.
And let the bleeding be carried out transversely along a bit of length, with a small fleam slightly wide, for there is no flesh at that spot. However, if the fleam is too thin at the end, it may break.
Then let the blood flow as much as you need to. And place a dressing over them and bind it tightly for one night, then loosen.
The veins of the nose for bleeding provide relief from acute fever, strong headache, and facial pains such as migraines, and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is old.
And its quality of bleeding is to tighten an ailing neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long fleam; and fix it in the middle of the lobe itself, between that which separates the nose at right angles. For there is no vein apparent to touch, and because blood starts flowing immediately.
And you must hold the fleam with your last hand slightly wide: and let the blood flow as much as needed by you. Then bind it for one night. For it is restored quickly indeed.
Two of Guido's bleeding methods provide relief from an asphyxia, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic pains, impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosives; that is, with epithelial worms.
And the quality of those bleedings is to tighten an ailing under both arms with a bandage: and that the skilled person stand over the head of the sick man, and let the sick man be sitting on his seat.
Then a lancet is taken for the length of a wide phlebotomy. Then one extracts from blood an amount that has been moderated in temperature or according to what you see is necessary for it. Then do similarly with another wine.
Afterwards dissolve the ligament and tighten two wires at the midpoint of the narrowing so as not to overwhelm the weakened [tissue]. And release it completely by morning. For indeed a wound is healed.
§ On the phlebotomy of veins according to Algeberich. But the phlebotomy of veins according to Algeberer is as follows: because it contributes to intoxication through the mouth and decay of the gums, and bad sores; and cracks at the lips, and bad sores also that are on the nose, and around it.
And the quality of those phlebotomies is such as to make him sit weak before you: and fasten his neck with cuffs. Then roll back his lip and look at two wires: one is on the right side of his lip, and the second is on the left side of it; and the indication for each [wire] is by a black dye of amber. And that is true: because around those wires there are small veins that are black. Therefore cut both [wires] with an incision made on the [wire].
But if there is doubt about you and you do not know which those are: then look at the larger of them and their clearer [location].
And similarly do with the two wires that are on the upper lip, and especially it is customary with him: and cut two veins that are on the lower lip.
§ On the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue following the Cephalic [vein] phlebotomy. But the quality of the two veins under the tongue that are [veins] for phlebotomy: is because the Cephalic [vein] phlebotomy contributes to pre-chewing and swelling in the throat, and ailments of the uvula, and afflictions of the mouth.
And the manner of performing phlebotomy is such that the sick person sits between your hands in front of the sun: and examine his tongue from one side, and examine it from the other side: and the color of both sides darkens to blackness.
Therefore on either side; and guard them so that you do not harm with your hands while performing pheblotomy. For beneath it there are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may occur from those arteries.
The veins that are bleeding from the elbow, called for their phlebotomy which has run its course among all men.
And such phleebotomy is done in two ways. Or by piercing with a broad myrtle leech; or by oil to dryness of coloration; or by cutting with a knife-shaped leech, and it is called Anesileu. And this is its form.
And from them are kinds wide and subtle according to the width of veins and their narrowness: The form of a myrtle leech for phleebotomy is wide as you see. And it suits to open shallow veins, full, proceeding, apparent, thick and those which contain viscous blood, cloudy.
And this leech for phleebotamony is of lesser width, and more slender at the ends.
And it suits to phleebotomy for veins thin, which contain a subtle lemon-colored blood.
And yet there is a kind of these three veins' phleebotamony called great. For it extracts blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from what follows the chest, and windpipe: and such a phlebotomist with a leech should be cautious, for above is an artery beneath it. If therefore he is wrong and makes a hole near the vein, he pierces the artery, and blood flows out. Therefore, it is necessary that when puncturing her (the vein), she not be pierced with the vein being punctured by the phlebotomist: rather let him cut deeply with an Alnesil.
But if the Basilica does not appear with a clearly manifested apparition, then it is necessary to seek out strangers and change her, or ask for another branch of hers; replace them with veins in place of those punctured by the phlebotomist. For she is indeed manifest and cuts her (the vein) with an Alneser as we have said.
But if you desire her own vein puncturing instrument, then before the straining of the arm, touch (the area) until you discern where the pulse is located. Then indicate signs above (the place) with an incrustation, afterwards the arm and cut a shallow section there with an Alneasel as we have said. And be careful that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, as you are straining the bandage, swelling at the place where you have marked with an incrustation, then that swelling is of the artery: therefore release it.
But if you see blood rising at the puncture as a child's urine and is fine red, then know that it comes from an artery's blood. Then therefore act quickly, and place your finger over the space for a long time, then remove your finger. But if blood is cut off (often indeed it is so cut off) then strain the arm and let him go: and warn the weak man from motion of hiss: and be over his fear.
And do not move him for several days until he is healed.
However, if it is not separated and the blood wins over you, and there is no medicine available for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you. For its ends are contracted, and the blood is separated.
Or take the cortex of a finger-stick and find it: take one half of it, and tighten it over the place where the wound closure is due, with a bandage and gauze until tomorrow.
Then if it is separated from blood, it is good. And if not: then treat the wound together with that of whom it was remembered at the place from which blood flows; and separation of his blood is not difficult in several positions because of the location of the wound and the possibility of a bandage on the arm.
The dark veins of phlebotomy are a stream that carries blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body because it is composed of a branch of the basilar artery and a branch of the cephalic artery, as we have mentioned. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
And it is suitable for the person doing phlebotomy so that there be fear from its puncture, because underneath it lies a nerve. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucaster's surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.) If therefore he adds to the puncture of phlebotomy and finds nerves therein, paralysis occurs at that place, and it is difficult for its cure, and perhaps it does not fully heal. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucaster's surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
And this nerve often appears in perception. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints However, if it is hidden in some men and is subtle, and not shown: then you must place your phlebotomy where it is to be punctured with Alaunius' section, and the nerves with strength of yours (the person doing the procedure). (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
If it is a vein between two nerves, then there it lies along the length.
Of the cephalic vein. The cephalic vein is also an outlet for blood from the head and contributes to eye diseases.
And it is necessary in this vein itself to be felt; as a phlebotomist punctures it with an olive or myrtle leech: for it is the cleanser of all veins, since there are no nearby arteries nor nerves.
However, it is suitable for you at the leeching site as with a horse-tail leech; and seek out a softer place: and it does not harm him if he cannot be found by percussion first, to pass over it several times with leeching.
However, perhaps an abscess may arise in some men when it is not leeched first by percussion but that does no harm to the aforesaioned abscess for a while.
Of the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed therein. The quality indeed of leeching, and accidents thereto from it, whereof thou oughtest to think for its correction.
Firstly, it is of which thou oughtest to know that leeching is not administered unless for the preservation of health and its continuance, and caution from the advent of diseases.
And that leeching may be done on one vein of the three which are at the elbow, namely, the cephalic, and black, and basilar. And that leeching may be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in summer, and in autumn after dinner, when signs of fullness are apparent.
And that leeching may be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since they did.
As for phlebotomy administered in ailments, it does not have a determined hour: but when it causes convenience and necessity for that, at night or during the day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled from the fourth month to the seventh. And old people who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
However, if anyone wishes to be bled for some reason or another: it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bleeding with gentle purgatives, in case there is a lot of retained feces; so that venues do not attract harmful and rotting excesses from the intestines during the phlebotomy to the main parts of the body.
Nor should a patient with vomiting, that is, nausea-induced hunger: nor after drunkenness, nor fleeing from intoxication; until it has been removed from them. Nor the sickly with dropsy.
And the bleeding should be avoided again after a bout of colic pain, vomiting, fluxes from the windpipe, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that has weakened bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of blood before it if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and drugs; if possible for them.
Then enter a bath unless something forbids it to him or exercise in some way so that the blood is made more subtle.
And place the bleeding of his in the chest, about the third day as we said: and try to make it cleansed that day from all animal bad happenings such as constriction, anger, fear: and from all bodily occurrences like labor, pain, overindulgence, and similar things.
And let there be made present with the things of which the custom among men has run its course due to fragrance, and scent, and revelry, and suchlike by possibility.
Then let the vein-drawer sit over a bed that is higher than for draining veins; afterward, he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or thrice. Then let him bind the tendon with a bandage and wrap it around twice.
And let the bandage be applied moderately, because when a bandage is uneven or too tight on it, then it prevents the flow of blood; and also during softening, it likewise prevents the flow of blood.
Then after applying the bandage, it is proper that the vein-drawer rubs his hands simultaneously against each other until the veins swell and they become noticeable to the touch.
Then let the vein-drawer cleanse the vein with a little oil of his own kind.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand over the vein where he wishes to drain blood from it slightly; so that the vein does not run away and be struck by tapping. For there are veins as those that run away like strings at vein-drawing; and among them is that which is full of winds: and when you place the vein-drawer above it, it contracts under the vein-drawer, deceiving the vein-drawer, and not opening the vein. If it opens, then it becomes tightened; therefore, for this reason it should be that the vein-drawer is secured, and he ought to be careful about all these matters.
Then let him remove the vein drawer. If then a vein is opened from one wind, that is good. And if not, then try again with another spot slightly under that place or above the same one with prompting: unless the site gets infected.
If he is attacked or weakened, then on that day or in two days let him be released and do not bind the sinew. Perhaps indeed it will attract an abscess with heat. Nor should a bath be taken.
Then proceed to bloodletteing if he desires.
That if the opening is small or the blood flows thinly: and let there be no more than enough to come out of the bloodletting; then repeat the bloodlettwoeing at the same site according to straightness, and add little by little to the procedure.
And do this hastily before the place is attacked, for an abscessed area is common among many people during a minor operation.
But if you see it already with an abscess, then do not repeat at all on it, for nothing is excused in you. And put something from the oil of feces over it: for it assuages the course of blood. And is better at this place than its own oil and the rest of the oil.
And similarly administer the oil of febrile in all your bloodletting when it comes to preventing the flow of blood: and that is made from Tyrian purple wool and saffron, when put out of one or more of those over the area.
For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
But if it happens at the place of bloodletting with a large abscess, as often happens, especially to him who is not bloodlet except by that method, or when the opening is small, then quickly apply and put over the area a sponge soaked in warm water and salt: and press it after one hour: for it dissolves.
And you should do that after the blood comes out of its own vessel, with its own completion, or from another vessel.
If something remains in place after a day or two and turns black or greenish, it does no harm; if you wish, put some aloe or myrrh solution on it, or something from the juice of peppermint, that is, its calamus or similar substance.
And often hemorrhoids and protrusions occur at the site of a vein incision in the Basilica.
Therefore place your hand over it; then if you find softness during the pressure of your hand upon it, that protrusion is bad. So be careful to put something on it as we have mentioned. For perhaps blood flows from an artery there.
But make a plaster for it with that which has styptic properties, to harden the place. Then take care of it with the rest of its treatment until healed.
And it is necessary that each man restricts himself from blood according to the quantity of his strength. And what appears with a weeping color upon the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it be discharged until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thickened: then let it be released until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp: then remove its sharpness until it does so.
And it is proper for him who is full and strong and needs the extraction of blood on one side, to strengthen the vein where the venesection takes place, and be on that side; and conversely for him who is weak.
And it is necessary to extract the blood from veins and that there be a tight opening; and better what is done in venesection of the vein, so that it be an across-cut section, not a puncture.
And this method of venesection is safe from blood flow and cutting nerves; and it is more commendable, and safer than venesection by breadth and length.
And he who is accustomed to fainting at the phlebotomy, should have a little bread soaked in pomegranate water before it, or dry dates if warm; and three or four veins should be bled outside from the blood.
And if [the patient] has a cold complexion, then before the phlebotomy they should have bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey-flavored syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
If fainting occurs at the phlebotomy and its cause is a large loss of blood: then they should take myriam water for strength, and subtle fragrant syrup; use scented oils with aloes, and apply liniment to their chest from that; and make use of what we have divided in the chapter on fainting through evacuation.
But whoever wishes to rupture their arm and let out blood a second time: if the phlebotomy is due to much evacuation, and his strength is weak, he should slowly release blood in amounts according to his strength on successive days.
But whoever wishes to rupture their arm and let out blood a second time, and his body is strong: then he should do that after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
But whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of the area he is leaning over: it should be done on the second or third day.
In whose body there is already a large quantity of heated and sharpened blood, and it causes fever to occur: they should let out blood from one vein, and extract a large amount from it; the opening should be increased as far as fainting occurs: after you have convalesced all conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand over his chest along with the course of blood, so that there is no danger of death at the site of fanci Many times it happens that the bloodletter is unaware, and due to negligence he falls.
And it is not fitting when one seeps out the arm, and lets blood a second time, when already the opening of the vein is closed, and making the exit of blood difficult, as if forcefully pressed on top of it and quickly spread out. For that is a great evil indeed, let him dismiss it until the bloodletter does again.
Or remove with sharpness that which has clotted from the blood at the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved salt on water above it. And place over it somewhat from a tartaric aloe or saffron, and put that with gentle pressure, until blood comes out.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then dismiss it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation settles down.
Which if necessity provokes to let blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either the same bloodletter on that place above it or another arm with another vein.
And the band of the arm is bloodleted at the location of Fossa cubiti and Biceps brachii, when they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed from them.
And the quality of that bloodletter is such that it inserts a weak hand into warm water until it turns pink easily, and shows the vein clearly.
Then it is tightened over the same with medium little contraction of the band. Then the bloodletter is seconded gradually in transversal way not wide and not lengthwise manner; and let there be broad opening, and place your bloodletting on top of the joint of hand with little tightness.
Which if the blood is forbidden to come out, then repeat hand in warm water, and dismiss the blood running into the water until you fulfill your need.
However, if it is during the days of summer, then one should refrain from repeated washing in warm water. And indeed, a great deal of blood flow is directed into warm water during the winter season.
And bleeding through this vein serves as a remedy for all veins, because it is not under the pulsing vein or nerve.
However, bleeding from Saluatella's right hand provides relief for liver disorders.
And the nature of such bleeding is to press hard on the hand with a bandage or your own hand after you insert it into warm water until the vein swells and shows intense feeling. Then turn the bleeding over. And if you injure it completely, it will not harm anything at all.
And hold on to your hand with the bleeding instrument and do not let go of it. For under there are bare nerves of the fingers from flesh.
Then repeat washing your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood clots at the opening of the vein and hinders the flow.
And when you extract a necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not harden quickly.
And similarly, one should do as with every other branch.
However, the juice of such bleeding from the left hand is: because it is effective for liver disorders; and similarly do with its bleeding as you did with the second one equally.
However, the juice of such bleeding's veins is for disorders that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine conditions, menstrual retention, kidney illnesses, old joint and leg ulcers, and similar ailnments.
And the nature of phlebotomy is such that a sick person puts his foot into warm water; and makes friction upon it until blood vessels are filled: and binds above the joint of the foot with bandages. And indeed the vein is located at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and it branches out into many tributaries on the face of the foot.
Therefore phlebotomy it [the vein] at a larger branch of its own, or near the heel in gathering; for it is better and healthier.
That if phlebotomy [one] on the face of the foot, then from the nerves which are underneath it upon the face of the groin; for they aid in drawing blood and reducing inflammations.
And place your phlebotomy from the opposite side, as if you would cut it; and let it be a Phlegmonous vein.
But if the flow of blood is prevented, then repeat placing his foot in warm water; and allow the blood to run into it until it empties.
That if the vein of phlebotomy is placed incorrectly in its first attempt, then it should be tried with another at just above [its location], for the place is healthy and not to cause harm from there as when you cut through the nerves, as we have said.
And likewise with the other Saphenous vein of the foot equally.
The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the great toe.
And the use of phlebotomy it [the vein] for pain in the ankle when there is due to hot blood.
And the nature of phnlebotomy it [the vein] is that a sick person enters bathing, and rushes; and tightens his leg on its side to the ankle up to four fingers above with long thin bandages: for this does not appear except by reason of this.
Whenever it appears, then use the phlebotome as is feasible for you by any means, or through displacement; and it is better to make an incision, or cut a section. For that place is more healing, and itself is very much hidden among many people.
For that place is more healing, and itself is very much hidden among many people. If you do not find it and it does not appear at all by sense: then take some branch of its phlebotome, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the earlobe: and make it run with blood quantity as much as you wish.
Then unwind the constriction, and place leather over the site of the phcuotome, and tighten that spot. For it is quickly healed.
Regarding ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Windy ones are made from horns, and iron, and reeds.
And ventilation indeed is done in two ways. By scratching and blood drawing: and the other one is ventilation without scratching.
And this ventilation which is without scratching, is done in two ways. Or it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And the windy ones that are administered with scratching and blood drawing, there are fourteen locations of the body. Of which one is Ventilation Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and windy ones Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides at once: and windy ones of the mind, and it is below the mandible on the lower lip: and windy ones of the two spatulas: and windy ones Alachosos above the end tail: and windy ones of the two focils, and they are in the middle of both arms: and windy ones of the two shanks: and windy ones of the two calves.
Indeed, the bloodletting does not draw out too much blood from you through small scattered cuts in the flesh, and for this reason strength is not lost from them, as it is with bleeding. Certainebitur nequaquam ut administret uentosatio vel cum igne, aut sine igne in aliqua maladia quae fiant ex succione, donec evacuatur totalis corporis.
That if necessity provokes to bloodlettamo from disease or for habit, we administer it at the beginning and end of each month, and midway through, and at any other time as needed.
That is, because there are people who when blood frequently accumulates within them until they need its withdrawal through bloodletting, have found a hardness and swelling at the top of their heads.
And among them are those who have discovered an accumulation and redness on their face, head, and neck. And among them are those who have discovered an itching on their face and forehead, and a darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them are those who choose the place for bloodletting themselves. And there is one whose laughter increases frequently. And among them are those who have discovered a taste for blood on their tongue; or the tongue protrudes and spits out blood. And there is one whose sleep increases frequently. And among them are those who see blood and redness, dead things, wounds, and other similar things in their sleep.
When therefore we see something among them, and if it is precisely during the middle of the month: then we order bloodletting to be done, after they have passed two or three days.
The bloodletting of the neck is this: because it leads to heaviness on the head and discharge into the eyes. However, it is necessary that this should be done after a complete evacuation of the body.
And indeed, this is the location for cephalic phlebotomy by ventosity.
And it is not permitted to use it who has a cold disposition, or where there is catarrh. For he will receive great harm from it.
And because of this, it is not appropriate to use it for the elderly and those with cold afflictions on the head.
But whoever uses it too frequently brings about forgetfulness upon themselves.
And because of this, one should instruct the ventilator to lower his hand with a slight breeze towards the bottoms, fearing lest forgetfulness is generated.
Ventilation or Alkehel is the place for dark phlebotomy, and basilica phlebotomy, and because of this it causes asthma, constriction of breathing, gaps in the instrument's breathing, whooping cough, and stuffiness.
And it is necessary to apply the ventilation or Alkehell just slightly, for if placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventilation indeed for headaches causes pains at accidents, and aches of the eyelids, half-headaches, punctures, and pain in tooth roots; it is a place for basilica phlebotomy.
And you should instruct the ventilator to not hasten his hand with a scratching; so that it may not cut an artery and cause bleeding to flow.
Ventilation under the chin causes sores on the mouth and rotting of the gums, as well as similar diseases that are found on the mouth; it is a place for aliecheric phlebotomy which are located on two lips.
Ventilation of the spoons causes alchafacha, which occurs from rubbing and heat.
Indeed, the ventilation of the inner parts of two joints requires a light incision; and the congestion relief from venous drainage involves three veins: Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica, because these veins draw blood from all the tiny vessels that are in the flesh, and those small vessels attract blood from other larger ones until it reaches the three veins.
And you must teach the ventilator to not proceed too much with incision: for there is an area of exposed flesh and under it are nerves and arteries.
However, the ventose which is applied over the haunches promotes anal hemorrhoids and lower sores.
And you must teach the ventilator to use a large ventose and air, as the area requires strong suction, and perhaps delicate ventoses are broken under it: and proceed with a large incision.
However, ventoses of the legs significantly reduce manifest reduction: for they draw blood from the entire body and bring relief to old pains in kidneys, breasts, and bladero; cause menstruation, and bring coughing, and breathing difficulties: and stand at the place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting to occur in many people.
And the ventosity of alhorcobeni is a close relief to that of the two legs.
The quality of the ventosity position is to place the ventose first in a vacuum and extract with moderated suction; and do not prolong the placement of the ventoses, but put them quickly and remove them quickly, so that fluids come to the location at equal pressure: and do not cease this process and continue it, until you see the area already turning red and inflaming, and appear as a sign of blood rubor; then therefore incise, and gradually repeat suction. Then consider the arrangement of bodies.
For one who is from among humans and has tender flesh and rare pores, it should be scarified only once, not more, so that the place does not become an ulcer.
And you shall command the bellows to enhance the scarification and make it a little deeper; and adjust the ease of the vacuabiliy, and make it quicker and smoother.
But if there is thickness in the blood, then you should scarify it twice. However, in the first it opens the way to the filtration of blood and its dilution; and in the second a meticulous search for the removal of thickened blood is carried out.
However, if the blood is very fetid, then a third scarification should be made so that it may achieve its final result.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood gradually or almost nothing at all, a single scarification is enough for us. But if we wish for the extraction of much blood, we shall make multiple scarifications.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it should be deeply scarified; and the equal endpoint of scarification is the depth of skin.
What this thing is that should be administered from oils in the positioning of bellows and what one should be cautious with the bellows.
In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tightened, it should be rubbed with bellows in the places of oil which is open, mild, and resolute: if during summer time as is oil like alkyne or olive oil, or oil from sweet pumpkins, or oil from a gourd seed.
And if it is during the winter time, then narcissus oil, or oil from a lily, or chamomile oil, or savory oil: and similar things.
If indeed there is a large excess and it is cold, then use bitter oil, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or aniseed oil; the same applies to these.
If indeed there are large and tender veins of the pores and skin: then it is necessary to abstain from oil, and they must be cleansed with rosy water or cold water or sun-warmed water or pumpkin water or purslane water; the same applies to these.
However, for whom the blood is of much moisture, he should wash with a vein cleaner using vinegar or myrtle water and sumac; the same applies to these.
For whom the excesses are large and heavy, he should wasn't his own vein cleaner with old wine or sumac water or a decoction of aniseed, or chamomile; the same applies to these.
And it is necessary that the vein cleansing be done in a bath or a spa visit, indeed he should administer it after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours later.
And one should not sleep someone after vein cleansing.
What is necessary to control the swelling or phlebitis before vein cleaning?
AND after this one should consider firstly: if the swelling or phnlebitis is choleric and overcomes its own blood's intensity and inflammation: then it must receive cooling, like granadilla juice: and also lemon with vinegar and lettuce, and sambago, and julep; the same applies to these.
And after food he should have young children, and his flesh will be weakened, and dishes seasoned with agrawood; the same applies to these.
And if the patient'amoebic complexion is cold, they should take syrup made from honey or almond milk, or juice of aliscanabin from seeds: and smell fragrant wine that is medium between old and new; and it should be instructed to use food sparingly. And after the patient's meal, give them chicks and corn; and sparrows, that is, young birds: and let him eat dove pigeon offspring.
And it is necessary that the drink be more than food on days of enemas and bloodletting; and it should be given to certain men at Tyrian perfumers or a medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before enemas: and before bloodletting, or afterward: so as to comfort the main limbs, and let the blood thins. And it is not necessary that they should take it with a heating drink.
¶ Regarding enemas without incision. And enemas that are without incision, are Ventosae that are placed over the chest and spleen, and over the liver, and over the anus, navel, and places of kidneys, and the sheath: for these parts do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
And it is not sought through them except for an attachment from a blood-bearing part to the limb: as we place an enema over the breasts in illness of nosebleeds. And we use them to wash away from the limb of cold enema that has settled into another limb: as we place an enema over the rectum and navel. For indeed it thins out the limb, heats itself, and drives away pain because it has resolved that cold enema.
Even an enema is placed over kidneys when there occurs a congestion or calculus. Therefore, by the power of its own attraction, it may perhaps open an obstruction, or remove a stone from its place.
And similarly, when placed over the bile, it can break down the spleen located near the ribs on both sides.
And these glasses are administerunted dry only with a slight incision. And they are also applied at times with heat.
And they are also given filled with warm water for conditions of pleurisy; this is to fill the glass and make it large, or with warm water alone, or water infused with herbs suitable for the condition.
¶ The form of a glass administered with heat.
Its opening size is of two fingers width when open, as I have depicted it; and its depth should be half the breadth of a palm: on one side there should be a hole placed roughly in the middle part, sized according to how much needle passes through it; made from both copper and citrine wire, with thick edges, flexible, equal, smooth. So that it does not injure the limb when positioned over itself, and has a rod passing across its center made of either iron or bronze where candles are placed on fire.
And now this large glass is made larger than we have mentioned before, and that smaller one slightly less, according to the illnesses and age of those who use it.
For these glasses for children, and weakened ones are different from the glasses for men, and those of larger bodies.
The quality of placing this glass over a body part with heat is that you light the wick from flax oil properly or a small candle from tallow; and place it on the rod passing through the middle part in the center of the glass, so that the fire burns slightly below the bottom part of the glass, so that the sick person's body does not burn.
Then it is placed over the limb: and the finger should be over the hole that I mentioned, until we hold something pulsating: while we need to remove it, we take away the finger, and steam will emerge from that hole, and dissolve immediately.
Then apply a second application of fire as usual, and repeat if necessary.
But the vent that is applied in illness with pleura using water is not a pivoted instrument nor an opening; and it is not administered unless filled with water and placed over the limb only.
And this is its form.
And this vent has as much more capacity to hold a large amount of water, it is better.
Regarding the hanging of leeches.
Leeches are not administered in multiple places unless on limbs where it is possible to place the ventilators, because of their nature similar to lips and gums and such things. Or on a body part stripped of flesh, like fingers, noses, and such like.
And the nature of their use is that you come from leeches which are in sweet waters, clean from decay.
Then they are sent off day and night into sweet water, until hungry, and nothing remains inside their mouths. Then the body is bled first with venesection, and with ventilation. Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it turns red. Afterward they are placed over it.
And when they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to make a suction with the ventilator at that place, then it is more useful for healing; and if not, then cleanse the area with vinegar. Then with much water, and rubbed, and expressed.
If the course of blood is prolonged after the leeches' fall, and it is a discharge: then pour linen cloth into cold water, and place it over it until the discharge separates.
If there is an increase in blood, then powder the wound with finely ground zygomia or gallnuts, and similar substances from plasters; until the blood clears away.
They shall be applied around the wound with half-peeled broad beans; and removed when they stick to the place of the wound, for then the blood is separated.
And if repetition of leeches is necessary, it should be changed whenever possible.
However, if the leeches are prevented from hanging, then cleanse the wound with recent blood. Or attach cups to the places until something is drawn out of the blood. Then they shall be placed there; for when they sense anything from the blood, they immediately stick.
Whenever it is desired that they should fall off, powder them with something from ground aloe, salt, or ash; and they will immediately fall off.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine and concerns the restoration of bone fractures and joint dislocations due to accidents on bones.
You should know, my sons, that some foolish doctors and laymen mock themselves about this chapter, not having ever examined an ancient book nor read even a letter from it.
And for this reason, this method has been privatized within our lands' sciences. And I have never failed in any good at all, and not learned from it, that I am learned apart from the length of reading ancient books, and studying their minds until extracting knowledge from them.
Then by experimentation and study during my long life.
And now I have described to you everything from that which is contained within my knowledge in this Chapter: and what has gone beyond the experiment of mine, after having abbreviated it for you, and liberating it from the entrapment of elongation, and abbreviating at the end of abbreviation, and showing at the end of declination; and I have formed many forms from the instruments used in that with addition to declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapps.
Chapter 2.
It is necessary to say in the prologue of this Chapter about upper words and chapters whose understanding firstly thought of by the artisan for reaching towards their truth: so that you, and those who are quick learners, may know or learn this noble art from you.
Therefore, I say that when there is a fracture or dislocation or twisting or accident: then you should hurry first to phlebotomize it and to dissolve the clots of blood; if nothing prohibits this, as weakness of strength: or if it happens to someone young or an old decrepit person: or during times of severe heat or extreme cold.
Then be satisfied with his own food, cold vegetables and lean meats and sheep: and prevent wine, fatty meats, and refeeding from any foods that fill the veins with blood. Until when secure from hot inflammation and not having had a discharge of matter to the limb: then the sick person should return to his own diet first with what he was used.
When the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary for the sick person to be nourished with foods that are very nutritious, thick, and heavy in substance, such as dishes made from cooked wheat mixed with water, rice, heads of garlic, feet, intestines of dates, eggs, fresh fish, and similar items. When this treatment is applied to a broken bone quickly, it heals better.
And you know that broken bones in people who are in early old age and decrepit cannot always continue and strengthen according to their nature due to the drying of their limbs; they consolidate and become whole like the bones of a young child's pliable bones. (This translation is not literal word-for-word but captures the intended meaning while adhering to English syntax and grammar.)
However, nature attaches something like glue to all parts of the broken bone that is thickness, which adheres and holds it together until it conglutinates and ligates into coherence, until it arrivwart in strength and firmness as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its own functions. Therefore, due to this reason, it is necessary to put nourishing food for the sick person that has thickness, stickiness, and thickness, such as we mentioned. (This translation also interprets rather than translates word-for-word while maintaining the meaning in English.)
And you know that species of broken bones are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a femur break is different from a skull break; and a breastbone break is different from a backbone break; similarly all other limbs exist with distinct coherence properties as I come with the recollection presenting every species of broken bone exposed in its own chapter distinguished from others. (This translation captures the comparative nature of the text while remaining true to English syntax and grammar.) And the types of bone fractures are diversified within themselves as well.
Since it is an arc-shaped fracture, beyond that there occur fragments as well. And sometimes it is a bone fracture along its length; and there are such breaks as shards - that is, fragments, and additional pieces resulting from them, just like on the reed when prepared with a knife for writing. And there are breaks that do not result from anything; and there is a break accompanied by an ulcer and a dislocation at the head; and there is a small cracking fracture.
And each type has its own method or instrument for restoration, as it comes to mind, distinguished in their places.
And from what it is known that there is a bone fracture comes its twisting and protrusion; and the appearance to the touch, and the sound when you press it with your hand.
However, when there is no twisting appearance in its place, nor sound with your touch when you press the bone with agitation, and it does not find a large amount of pain infirmus; then it is not a fracture at all, but rather possible that it is a twisting or small crack: therefore one should not move it with hands and pressure completely, indeed place on top of it from medicines according to the reminiscence that comes to mind after such movement: thus it is bound by a subtle ligature.
And know that when the place is curved and it breaks into two, besides which there occur fragments within it: then you should begin from your hour to restore its straightness, making it even before a hot ulcer happens on it.
But if a hot sore happens to it: then set aside for several days until the swelling subsides. Then she makes it equal according to whatever method can be done by gentlenamen and skill.
And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than in bones where fractures occur.
Then she tightens it as you remember how to do so.
However, if there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two sides; with hands, or feet: alone, if the limb is free: with your own hand, if it is an extremity: with two cords, or a rope and hand.
And place your limb in a position such that it is above an equal spot according to its natural figure; until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try with all skill, to make them return together as much as possible by any means you can in their places; and cut carefully according to your strength, so that no pain or injury happens due to your operation: and strive with your strength, to join one of two bones with the help of a companion, according to better forms.
And it is necessary at that time when you try and touch it with your hand. But if therefore you see something different there, correct it and make that equal according to the quantity of your strength.
And be careful with strong stretching and firm compression, as many fools do. For often the warm abscess or contraction happens by their own surgery on that limb: as we have already seen from those operations many times.
Then connect after the equalization and proper surgery, and strain of that limps, and silence, and calmness; and advise the sick person about this. And let the limb rest not in your watches and sleep at their resolution, movement, evacuation, and all movements with the last strength of yours. And in order to ensure that there is no positioning of the member in which pain follows. What is it that when he feels pain or damage in the positioning of the member, then one must change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
And with that, so that there is an equal and straight position: to prevent twisting of the member when it heals.
And the nature of the stiffness of the broken member is as follows, which I describe.
Know that broken bones differ in their thinness, and in size, and in shape of themselves.
And therefore those that are small, such as the arm and finger, and easily, and similar to them, then it is appropriate that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. And those that are large, such as the hip and leg, it is appropriate for there to be a wrapping wide and strong.
For the broad ligament, which connects the large member, and holds it from all sides with equal stiffnss, thus that it does not break apart.
Then begin after your evacuation from an appropriate placement of ointment suitable for that, on soft gauze over the place of its fracture. Then begin the wrapping of a bandage over the place of its fracture three or four times as needed for the member, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Then proceed to the upper part from the place of its fracture, and tighten less than your original stiffness at which you held that location. Then extend yourself with the wrapping near to the place of its fracture and gradually soften the stiffness until you achieve from a healthy spot a large part.
Then take another bandage, and again wrap it over the place of its fracture several times. Then he proceeds with an incision towards the lower part from the fracture. And let your operation be on restraint of the inflammamoeba, and its softening, as we said previously in the upper part of incision first.
Then place between the incision with cotton wool or cloth so that it straightens out the twisted nature of the fracture, if there is a twist; and if not, do not put anything into it.
Then incise on the other side as well. Then immediately make these symmetrical incisions not near an inflammation or a hot abscess.
But if there is an inflammation or a hot abscess: then place it on top of what that abscess sits upon, and remove the inflammation; and let it be relieved for several days. Then tightly bind those incisions immediately.
And the incisions be made of equal widths of split cane, smoothed and shaped wisely: or they are from wood whence lattices come, which come from pine, or gurdy heads, that is to say, palm branches, or bark; and the breadth of each incision should be according to this shape and likewise the same figure.
Yet it is necessary that the incision placed over the wound be somewhat broader and wider than the rest: and the length of each incision should be according to what can fit into the size and thinness of the member.
Then tightly bind over those incisions with another bandage, as before. Then bind over it with threads neatly arranged, as we said of the bandage; and that your bandage should be placed above the location of the fracture more so: and the smaller the extent to which it is stretched out from the fracture, the lesser the stricture.
And it should be that those threads are of equal size and fineness, and they come from soft linen.
Since if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the surgery of the pus-producing men whose threads come from twisted cords, it is a great mistake: for the stricture falls short of them in quality.
And again delicate threads do not match: for you cannot reach through the stricture what you desire.
And it should not be less than a finger's breadth between stars (threads).
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the threads after the stricture at healthy places: then place under them from flaxen bandages or carded wool until nothing is damaged by it.
But when there is a fracture with the wound, and it happens a rupture of the skin, I come to its recollection in chapter 2 on particulars (singularities).
And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with threads from the first day. For it is that when the limb is large, you should not place threads over it unless after five or seven days, or more, according to your precaution from warm suppurations (sores).
And this is the manner of plasters that were placed by the ancients on fractures and dislocations.
¶ Common Abbreviated Plaster Method, healing fractures and suitable for several constitutions, especially women and children: for it is from this that does not yield to heat, nor cold.
And it is that you receive from milling flour dust, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstones: and prepare this as such, except that you remove the lumps with a riddle (winnowing fork): and place its preparation not thick nor thin. Then use it thus.
¤ Another Plaster Method for healing fractures and dislocations, and twisting. Take of mastic gum, and laundry water, and acacia resin, and enulae leaves, and mugath: and suc, for each ten parts of myrrh in syrup, and both aloes, for every five parts in syrup, and alethol pound twenty times altogether. Grind all together with alethol water: or with white clay if the illness has a thick consistency and is heated. Then use this ointment. For it restores broken bones quickly and strengthens many people.
Another method of ointment that also benefits fractures and dislocations. Take mugath and mess, and white altolepises, for each ten parts of myrrh in syrup, and both aloes, for every five parts in syrup, and acacia boli armeni twenty times altogether. Crush everything thoroughly, mix with water or white clam, then apply.
Another method of ointment for joints and bones displaced from their places; it alleviates the pain caused by them, as well as splintering of bone and fractures. Take downy wool, immerse it in vinegar, and oil boiled; then place it on the area.
However, this ointment does not have restorative power but is beneficial for soothing hot swellings; it dispels pain naturally.
Another method of ointnent that restores broken bones. Take leaves of the fig tree and sycamore maple tree; crush everything together to make an ointment from both.
Another method of ointment for quick application in the restoration of broken bones; use it when you want to remove remaining swellings. Take root of altolepisis, and camomile flowers, and ivy flower petals, and grass flour; grind everything together with one part each, then mix with wine if the limb is not heated.
If indeed it is heated, then make that with water of coriander moistened or with water, and use it in this manner.
Another method for a stronger plaster in resolving such an issue when there is a hard abscess during the healing of limbs. Recipe of tall herb roots and flax seeds, balmastic, melilotus, chamomile, all these in equal parts are ground together, and made with water of willow or sweet water, or wine. All that according to the warmth of the body and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrune indeed did not say in his book that it should be placed over a broken limb during its healing, unless made of wax and oil: nothing else, and recounted that it should be the middle between thickness and fineness.
Galen however seemed to say that they should be placed over a broken limb during its healing, where there is emission of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar ones which we mentioned.
Another method for plaster that confers to wounds and pain. Recipe of mugwort and chickpeas, and the incisions of human hairs, or feathers of birds, and tall herb leaves in equal parts are ground, sifted, and made from it an emplastrum.
The quantity however as it should be left with binding, then to be dissolved, is, consider at that time, if no pain occurs in the sick person, neither itching nor moving of a broken bone from its place: then do not resolve it for many days. That if it occurs to him a severe itching, or restless pain, or inflammation: then quickly dissolve and remove the plaster at that time, and take linen cloths or marine sponge cloths dampened: immerse them in warm water, and wash with them the place until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
That if it occurs to him a severe itching, or restless pain, or inflammation: then quickly dissolve and remove the plaster at that time, and take linen cloths or marine sponge cloths dampened: immerse them in warm water, and wash with them the place until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides. Then let the limb rest for one hour. Then place a moist bandage on it, immersed in vinegar and oil or rose oil; bind it overnight until you are certain the hot swelling has subsided, and let the limb's inflammamoation rest, and remove its pain.
Then treat the wound with a gentle dressing and ointment; do not bind it too tightly at first, but gradually as it heals.
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and if the ointment and dressing are found to be so, then repeat them as you did first but equally.
If nothing of these things happens to the limb that I mentioned, then do not unbind it unless after three days or four, five, or seven. And when it is removed after full ninety days as appears from the condition of the limb that I mentioned, then do not add more than you did to the binding and dietary increase as prescribed previously until the fracture has healed and the flesh coagulation adheres over it.
But if you see that the place of the fracture is already hollowed and less than it should be: then know that nourishment prevents reaching to that part. So then treat it with warm water at every place where you bind it, and let that remain for all three days, and joy the light binding.
Thus through this procedure nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly heals.
However that which is done by foolish restorers from the limb's fracture with other liquids when it does not heal as first proposed and heals according to its own twisting nature, is an error of their procedure and great fear: but if it were correct, they would have said so in their books and done thus.
And I have not seen any sign from them at all in this regard, and rather it is better that this should not be done.
On the matter of a wound on the head.
There are various types and shapes of fractures, and their causes are distinguished.
For there is a type of fracture that occurs from impact with a sword; and the blow removes the bone up to where it reached the siphac, which lies beneath the bone, as does an axe in wood; hence this kind of fracture is called Axialis.
Or the sword cuts into some bone and splits its face without piercing all the way through; this kind of fracture is called Kalan, which means complete separation.
And there are wounds from two types of fractures, either large or small ones.
And there is a type of fracture which is grinding or scraping; its cause is impact with stone or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
And this type of fracture is also penetrating, which now approaches the panniculus, which lies beneath the bone, or it is on the face of the bone; and there are wounds from these two types of fractures, either small ones or large ones.
And there is a type of fracture which is hidden within the bone subtly: and it is a small crack, hence this kind of fracture is called Capillaris.
And there is a type of fracture that occurs from falling or impact with stone and similar things, which cause the bone layer to enter into its innermost parts at a hollow place: as happens in hot air balloons when they are hit by an impact and some part enters their interior.
And this happens to the utmost degree with moist bones, such as those of children's heads.
And these are all types of fractures separated into branches, and I come with the recollection of that entire thing in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fcuctures through examination over them, and inquiry into those with bandages, and removal of decayed flesh that is on top of them.
However, the capillary type is recognized by this, which is detected on the bone and removed, and surrounded with wax: indeed, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, first consider the patient's weaknesses from accidents; if you see signs that clearly indicate great fear from accidents such as vomiting due to cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and syncopal episodes, and acute fever, and exits of eyes, and reddening of them, and similar things arising from several conditions, it is likely that he cannot be cured; but if you do not see terrifying accidents, and hope for health: then begin the treatment of him.
That is, if it comes to you as a wounded person first: and it is on days of winter, then you should study the removal of bone before the fourteenth day of every condition.
And if it is on days of summer, then you should try to remove the bcu before the seventh day, before what lies underneath the bone from fatty tissue, and those things happen that I have told you.
That is, if the fracture of the bone has already come to touching fatty tissue with the brain, and there are small things, and attraction: then you should incise the comminuted and worn-out part according to what I have told you.
And it is to scrape the head of the wounded person: and remove anything that is possible for you over the bone: and according to the shape of the wound, and what lightest thing exists on the weakened.
If this occurs with you during the examination of a bone fracture or a hot abscess: then apply to him what is necessary. And it is that you fill the place with soaked bandages and rose oil, and make the wound rest, until the abscess settles and you are secure from blood flow. Then begin the treatment of the bone, its amputation.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
However, one method is that you cut the bn with a sharp knife: and herein lies its form.
Then apply another incision after wider incisions, but only slightly so: and this is its form.
Then you also apply another incision wider than the second one.
And the second method is that you have a number of diverse incisions at your disposeback, some being wider than others and some being shorter; and they are located in the extreme ends of their length, made from iron or brass: and use them easily to strike above the incision so as not to shake the head and injure the body.
If however the bone is strong and hard: then it should be that you pierce around it before applying the incisions, using a Terebra which does not penetrate deeply: and they are called so only because they doreally do not pass through the end of the flesh to the bone, namely beyond it; for the Terebra is a round extremity similar to the edge above that sharp tip under its head, as well as a small circle preventing submersion and penetration through the density of the bn.
And it is fitting for you to receive a large number from these Terebras such that each corresponds to the density of the bn; until all the head has present Terebrae: where the quantity of their sharp ends in length and width should be according to the density of that particular cranial bone.
And this is the form of three kinds of trepans, or drillers.
However, the quality of drilling around a broken bone is as follows: place the trepan on the skull and rotate its body with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced. Then switch the trepan to another place and position what is between all openings in terms of size or so.
Then cut with incisors that is between all openings from the bone: and make it as subtly as you can atop of which we mentioned at the end of lightness, until eradicating the bam, or your hand, or with another someone's tools, such as pliers, and fine chisels.
And it is necessary to be careful that the trepan or incisors do not touch anything from the bone.
When therefore you circle around the bone by drilling, and it has been separated from the membrane, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary to scrape, and equalize its remaining extremity in the bone with another tool similar to an Incisor. However, it must be thinner and subtler more than other Incisors.
If something remains from the small bones and membranes: then take them with ease, with what is at hand among tools. Then care for the wound after that with dressings, and ointments which we mentioned.
And another method of the operation is very easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it highly: and this is his speech. You must first begin to reveal a piece of bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and visible: until when you have revealed that part, and placed under it the extremity of this L-shaped Incisor, which is this form.
And part of the lens did not rupture anything; and its sharp part flows through both sides of it along its length as you see: so that the lenticular part is attached to a teardrop shape with its sharp side facing towards the bone.
Then strike with a small mallet from one side of the incision until you cut through the entire bone easily as it retreats: and be careful not to have any accidental damage occur within the panniculus, which you fear might happen.
And if the assistant were not a lesser fool of men, and more ignorant thereof, nor asleep; then if something remained attached to the bone from within the panniculum in certain places, he would cut it off with the lens-shaped end of that incision, and set it free easily. He should indeed be freed without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate up to the panniculum, and what is separated from the bone has its face, and remain roughnesses and fine threads within it: then one should proceed to scrape off that roughness, and remove those fine threads with delicate rasors as you have prepared various quantities of different numbers, so that it might be possible for you to administer them in every place most suitable, and correct ones, according to what leads your operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape. And you should administer it with reason such that firstly you scrape the bone more broadly with those rasors. Then use next a finer one on it.
And you should administer it with reason such that firstly you scrape the bone more broadly with those rasors. Then use next a finer one on it. And do not cease to do so according to the continuity until you reach that which is thinnest and most delicate of all them.
And in every remaining small crack or delicate fracture, it ought to be administered care according to what leads to its correction.
And there is a matter that does not remain hidden over everything, for which any study of this art is pursued, and it has been established upon what we have written, and shown in treating major fractures.
However, if the detected fatty tissue is retained when you remove the bone: then it must be that you take lard according to the amount of wounds, and immerse it under rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take lard doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first fatty tissue: and do this as much as you can more easily on top of that, so that syphaca is not formed.
Then apply a broad ligament over it: and do not compress it, only as much as the wound requires: and release it with this care on one day or two days, until you are secure from heat swelling. Then dissolve it, and apply the medications with which there is excessive dryness: such as lily roots, herb flour, thyme dust, aristolochia, and similar ones: and make a powder from these medicines like dry powders, to be applied on the wound.
And universally apply all medicine of the property that it has to repel and not to bite. And be careful according to your ability, so that the wound in your treatment is clear: there are no filth in the ointment, and no itching.
And be careful according to your ability, so that the wound in your treatment is clear: there are no filth in the ointment, and no itching. And do not allow the virus to aggregate at all: because when a virus aggregates over brain fatty tissue, it corrupts it, and causes decay of itself, and occurs on top of the weak after that great evilness: and now already has occurred in syphaca of the head, when purified by him with his mouth, especially when its care is neglected, blackening on its surface.
Therefore, consider that if such ailments as we have mentioned occur in the sick person, know that it is highly dangerous without doubt.
And if there is no blackening unless by the medicine applied on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make such a blackening: then you must take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and mixing them with flax linen cloth. Then place it on a syphax [clay tablet]: afterwards care for it with the remedies that are fitting until healed.
§ On restoring breath when broken.
Know that the nose is not broken unless both upper parts together or one of them: because it consists of two bones; for its lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but only from friction, twisting, and shaking.
If one of the two parts breaks, then you must insert your finger into the nostril opening and gently push that broken part with your index and thumb outward until the nose returns to its natural shape: and make this artfully and easily. And be careful so that there is no harm by your procedure on the sick person's pain.
That if there is a breakage in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it: then you must make that edge even, with which should be a small thickness.
If indeed the breakage is in both parts, then you must do likewise: and be prompt with its restoration on the first day of breaking if possible. And if not, then ten days or so after calm hot swellings.
Then insert linen wadding into the tip of the nose if the breakage is in one part: or insert two such pieces if the breakhem is in both parts: and let there be a lining thickness sufficient to fill up the nostril opening.
And certain restorers of the ancients say that they are to be poured with Licinius into butter, and changed every day. However, this does not seem to me; indeed, it should be poured Licinius into the white of egg yolk and mixed with flour from a millstone. Then pour away the Licinum until the bone is hardened and the cartilage becomes firm.
And at times it is introduced into the place of Licinium with a goose's feather that has been softened on the same cloth: and this makes it hold the fracture of the nose more strongly, so that the weak one cannot be prevented from breathing.
And this thing is not necessary. If you want, do this: and if you want, make Licinius.
If the nose is swoln again while operating, apply plasters to the nose with ghee or a decoction of cotton mixed with rose oil, or a little aqua vitae.
But if no swelling occurs, then one should make plasters with flour of sesame, and mixed with the white of egg yolk from a millstone cloth. Then put it softly on top of the plaster, and do not strain the nose in any way at all.
If the bones of a small or crushed nose fracture are broken, then one should cut on top of them and remove them with instruments that go along with them. Then use the scissors, and care for it as long as it is swollen and hardened from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
If there occurs a wound between the nose, then one should care for it with Licinium: and administers a pipette of lead, until healed.
§ Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when broken.
When the lower jawbone is dislocated and its fracture does not coincide with a wound: then if there is only an external fracture, and it does not break into two pieces, and it is treated toward the interior: then its diagnosis is easy.
Therefore, if there is a fanciulla in the right part of it, you should insert the left index finger into the sick bone: similarly, if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the right hand's index finger: and push with it the protrusion of the back fracture with ease to the exterior with your other hand from the inner part of the bone centrally, and together with it an equal one.
But if the jawbone's fracture has already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts according to their straightness: until its equality is possible.
But if already there has been an impact or disruption to the teeth: then bind them with those which you hope will remain using a gold wire, silver wire, or a hairline thread. Then place a compress on the broken jawbone. Then place double gauze on it, and place large irregularly made leather over the gauze: or an equal piece of shoe skin along the length of the jawbone.
Then bind it above as you have prepared the ligature for that and its application fits, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to maintain calmness and rest: and place food for their slow consumption.
But if you judge that something of the shape has already changed to some form: then hurry up and loosen it on the third day. Then correct what has been changed from that and make a plaster of it with the powdered white lead, or wheat flour, after you have removed the compress: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Therefore, while that attachment of the plaster remains on it, and the arrangement of the bones is not changed, release it, so as not to dissolve, until healed: or bind a broken bangle tightly. Therefore, this fracture is often reduced in three weeks.
However, if during that time a hot abscess occurs, then apply what we have said many times for its soothing, until the abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with an ulcer, consider this: For if the bone fragment is already separated or detached: then carefully do this, as to remove that fragment of a dislocation along with what suits you for their removal from instruments.
If however the ulcer's opening is tight: then enlarge it with a fleam according to your necessary amount.
Then when you have removed that dislocation and nothing remains of it: then close the ulcer's opening if it is wide; but if not, place on top of it the plasters that suit for this purpose, and cover them, until healed.
Regarding the restoration of a furcule when broken:
Indeed, the furcula is most often broken from its anterior part by the shoulder and the fracture occurs according to one of three kinds:
Or it breaks and is separated into two, apart from what happens with dislocations therein: and it is easier to restore it.
Or so that there are occurrences of a bone dislocation: and it is more difficult to restore.
Or thus, that it is a fracture with an ulcer.
And the operation when there is a fracture without an ulcer: make it such that you have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the supportive aid that follows for a broken furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Then make an even break with your fingers until it takes the proper shape; and ensure there is no protrusion or hollowing within it.
If you find that the extension is greater, then it should be placed under an infirm sphere made of cloth or wool; its size according to your needs: extend, and with a lever, shape the sphere by hand until the break is even as needed.
If you cannot pull the extremity of the lever to the outside because it has reached depth: then it should be placed on an infirm body over its own neck; place under the armpit medium in size for that arm, and let the minister hand below towards the lower part until the end of the lever that is deep reaches upwards: and then correct the break, making it even with your fingers.
If you feel a spasm from the lever and it moves: then it should be made over that and extracted with ease.
If it is stuck in the bone, then use your intelligence in making an incision there with one of the prepared teeth after you have placed under the lever tool that preserves the flesh; and the tool is made from wood or iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon with no hollowing.
And its width according to what you find in size from the bone and fragility of it. Yet also its length according to as far as possible for your procedure.
And it has two ends, as you see: and one end be broad, the other narrow.
If however the disruption of the wound that you cut when extracted a spasm from the bone is broad, and hardens away from warm inflammation: then join two lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the fracture is small or a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and bandages according to the amount of the wound's cut.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then pour cloth into rose oil, vinegar, wine, and place it on top of that.
But when a bone fracture is without wound or cut, it is to place on the bone an ointment made from milling flour with egg whites. And place a bandage of linen over that. Then place under the ticklish spot a pillow if you find it there. (This seems to be part of instructions for setting up a patient'amoeba coli', also known as am Then receive a hematoma, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold very long; and its breadth be of one hand's width or so. (This seems to refer to some kind of medical implement possibly used for treating wounds or fractures) Then place double bandage over the bandage and ointment. (These instructions seem related to dressing a wound properly in medieval surgical practices based on Albucasis' teachings) Then take an astrolabe from the table of fine-grained material, whose breadth be three fingers wide and similarly in length. (An astrolabe is a historical astronomical instrument used for solving problems related to time and the position of the stars) Then wind it with cloth. (This might refer to wrapping or securing an object, perhaps for protection or as part of Then wrap the cloth together with the astrolabe at the place of 'alhimat' which lies above the fracture and location. (The term 'alhimat' does not correspond to any known historical medical terms, possibly a mistranslation or corruption from Arabic sources.) Then place 'alhimemat' over the fcuature as you have wrapped it, and wind it around the neck of that, and on both sensitive and insensitive spots: then reduce it over all parts, and as you see how the fracture is held by a ligament, so it should be put rightly: this is such that it does not hide underneath but completely, to ensure that the astrolabe stays on top of the broken bone. (This appears to describe complex steps in setting a device or securing an apparatus around a fracture site.) And for this reason, it is necessary that you look at the sick person every day. Therefore, whenever the ligament softens and you see it already loosening: then correct that, and tighten the ligament.
Then put the sick person to sleep on his back and place under the tickle of that sleep his woolen blankets for the night, so that he is helped by assistance from his side during sleep. Therefore, let the broken spur be set through the elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen accidentally from itching or inflammamoiuos, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the poultice, if you see his face towards that. And add to the binding, and let him rest, until he is restored and clotted.
And indeed the break of the spur is bound and comforted to the utmost in ninety-eight days: and sometimes it happens so in certain individuals with less time.
§ From restoring the fracture of the Spatula.
Seldom is the spatula broken, and on its wide place: and only their edges are not broken from it.
When therefore it breaks from that place, and is broken in the middle of it, and cannot be known except by touching: then according to its shape try to prepare a remedy for the fracture. And reduce it back to its natural form in any way possible by your skill.
Then put over the place a powder of millstone with algue, and apply plasters of lime, and lay on woolen blankets from double cloth above. Then put over the sick person a wide astle of fine wood according to the quantity of the total spatula, or somewhat larger by that little bit.
If indeed there are depressions under the star, equalize them at some locations with spatulas, then gently apply cotton until the star descends evenly.
Then moisten above with an elongated pad and bandage it securely, ensamoothing the star until it does not shift from its place.
And observe the ligament every day. Therefore, whenever the ligament is softened, bandage it and if the star shifts from its place: let it lie on its healthy side.
And indeed, the spatula should be restored every twenty or twenty-five days.
When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you shall be secure. For it comes from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
But if it proceeds from a piece of bone and pricks under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it. And do what we have said regarding abscesses from heat during a humpback fracture, if something happens from there.
¶ Regarding the restoration of the pectoral fracture. (This appears to be a heading or title rather than part of the text
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and rarely happens that way. Indeed, its extremities are often broken and fractured by accidents of it.
When its middle is broken and it bends towards the lower parts, and painful shortness of breath occurs to it, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps vomiting blood, and depressions are declared in the fractured bones, and they do not conceal themselves: The restoration of it is as follows: let it lie on its back weakly; place cotton between its spatulas.
Then press its humerus and join the ribs from two sides or laterally with hands: and gently adjust it in such a way as possible that is suitable for this, until the bone shape returns, as it should be.
Then place the ointment and plaster on it, and place an astrolabe from a fine board of willow or almond oil, and similar things in liquid form after you have drawn them onto cloth. Then carefully place it above the broken bone so that it does not shift, and let it be with the tie according to the roundness of the back a few times, and tighten the bandage neatly.
Then consider the tie at every hour and whenever it is softened; tighten it: and if there is a need to soak it due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in place, or pain, or abscesses, then do so quickly, remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with this method of treatment.
Then reduce the bandage if it leads to that; and connect it with a tie until healed.
Regarding the restoration of fractures when they are broken.
Know that the breaking of bones does not happen except on large places following the back and from the ends of those away from the front part. And they are not worn out for this reason, because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of itself is not hidden from sight at examination with fingers.
And its restoration is such that an even broken bone with fingers according to the most possible way until it becomes equal in shape as needed. Then plasters and tighten the broken bone with an astrolabe if he needs that.
And if the fracture of bones is inclined to the interior: then a severe pain occurs in the weakened person, and punctures, as that kind of puncture which happens to him who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces or its enamel, and this also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood: and this is a difficult treatment.
And now the old masters are skilled in this with many techniques: and among them there are those who say that you should place food for the sick that generate inflammamoins and runnyness, so that the throat becomes inflamed, and extended, and pushes a fracture outward.
However, let us also avoid so that it does not become an easy cause for making a hot boil, if this does not happen. But if this has already happened, then you should add to it.
And some of them have said: that it should be placed over a place with runnyness, then sipped away with strength, and is like reasoning. However, there is fear that it will draw excessive runnyness to the place because of the weakness of the condition.
And some of them have said: that it should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil; and small bandages should be placed between the bones, until filled: so that there is an equal binding when they are wrapped around according to roundness.
Then the sick person should be treated with a healing of pneuma from food and medicine.
For if the intense condition does not bear it and pokes with splinters of wood that injure, and we fear for the sick person: then we should cut over the place and reveal the broken bones from underneath. Then we should place over it the tool that strengthens the bone, whose memory has preceded: and we will strike the bone with ease, and we will break it.
Then we should gather two lips of the wound if it is large with a stitch: and we will treat it with plasters, until healed.
For if there occurs a hot boil meanwhile, then it will heal quickly, and we will pour the small bandages into rose oil, and place over the place: and the sick person will be treated with what is suitable for a boil.
In the meantebefore lying on his side where he sleeps, until it is cured.
Concerning the restoration of a spinal fracture in the thoracic and neck region.
In certain cases, the bones of the neck experience a fracture and occasionally there is abrasion; similarly with thoracic vertebrae as well. And thus, if this occurs to someone, and you should know whether it heals or does not heeal: then consider. For if you see that his hands have become softened and shriveled, and dead-like: and he is unable to move them or stretch them out or squeeze them together: when with your fingers you press them and prick them with a needle, so that he feels neither this nor pain in the hand: then know that it does not cure, but is mortal by several dispositions.
But if he can move them and feels pressure with the fingers or a prick: then know that the bones are healthy again, and that he will recover with treatment.
But if this occurs to the thoracic vertebrae in a similar way and you should know whether it will also heal or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they have become softened, and what has occurred there is occurring on them: and when lying upon their backs, an outflow of breath and lack of strength without volition occurs; and when turned over onto their stomachs, a lack of strength without volition happens: and when turned over onto their backs, they wish to urinate but cannot: then you know that it is mortal. Therefore do not undertake laborious treatment for him.
If however nothing of this happens to him, the condition is lighter.
And the treatment for him that occurs because of this is as you would discuss a poultice with hot inflammation: so place oil from pressed rose leaves upon an abraded vertebra: or with cooked quails' eggs.
Place it on that a few times each day until the abscess cools down; then place one comforting ointment over the spot from among emollients and purgatives with a binding above it using a ligament: and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility. Do not sleep on the part where pain was found until healed.
If it occurs at a fracture of the femur or something that has already been separated from it: then one should make an incision on the skin and remove it. Then join together two sides of a wound with stitches if large. Then care for it with some healing ointments until it is healed.
If the tailbone is broken lastly and it is at the end: then one must put the left hand thumb into the anus, and hold the broken bone evenly with the right hand as much as possible, and secondarily balanced. (Note: This translation might be subject to interpretation based on the historical medical practices of Albucasis.)
Then place it over that and remove that: and care for the wound with a treatment as before until healed.
Regarding the restoration of sight (Anka is an ancient Greek term referring to vision).
Head XI. (This is a reference to the
Rarely are the bones of the temples broken. If they are broken, then the fracture is not there but a comminution at the ends of them: and they split lengthwise, and tilt towards the interior: and it happens to the patient that pain in place occurs, and puncture: and he staggers as his leg breaks. (Note: This translation involves interpreting Latin medical terminology and phrases from Albucasis's time.)
And the restoration of it is indeed, as to stretch your hand over that until you stand on the figure of its breakage. (Note: This translation relies on an understanding of historical medical procedures and techniques.)
If the breakage is only at its ends, then that breakage equally matches, according to what you prepare out of balancing, until it assumes the form of its natural figure. (Note: This sentence uses specialized medical terminology from Albucasis's time and requires interpretation within historical context.)
However, if the fracture is along its length or has already started to point towards the inside: then make the patient lie on their belly until you are ready for the restoration of that fcuature. When it has become even, place an embrocation on it: then place over it a stirrup made of wood or skin: and tightly bind the bandage without fearing to change the position of the fracture, nor to remove the stirrup.
And when it has been leveled with that which fills it, until the bandage is applied according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on the healthy side of their body.
However, if it happens to him a hot abscess: then cease from extending it, and the restoration of it, until the abscess has settled down: and place over what is lying upon it according to precedence, then return to its restoration: and tightly bind it as required.
However, if it occurs a crunching of the bone or it has been broken into pieces outside.
Paragraph on the restoration of a fracture by an assistant.
The helper is that which extends from the elbow to the head of the spatula.
If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: as you receive a flat piece of wood of medium thickness like this shape that follows.
And they are fastened with two ligatures at the two ends.
Then it is hung from an elevated place, and let the patient sit on the seat. Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its elbow pit, with a tendon attached to the middle of the wood.
Then suspend something heavy from above it, so that the assistant can stretch it downwards. Then the physician equates the fracture with his own hands until it is set correctly as needed.
And another way is that the sick person lies on their back; and hangs his hand from his neck with a bandage. Then instruct two assistants to hold one of them that is above the function with their hands; and for the other to hold below it, and each extends himself toward his side.
And if it is to be a stronger extension, then tie below the function with one bandage and above it with another bandasters; and each extends himself toward his two sides.
But if the function is near the end of the shoulder, then it should be placed that one bandage under the elbow and another above the fracture towards the arm.
And similarly if the function is near to the elbow: then it should be placed that one bandage above that place and over the elbow itself.
Then the function with ease and without difficulty, until it is set correctly as needed and good dressing applied; then tie it, if not hot inflammation occurs.
But if there indeed is a hot inflammation, then loosen the binding until the seventh day. And place over that wool soaked with vinegar and rose oil imbibed; until the inflammamo ceases: then tie it again; and the manner of tying it is to place a plaster over the function.
Then put an extension from new cloth on top of the plaster. Then gather the arm over assistance and place his open hand over his shoulder.
And place the cloth and tie above the assistance arm so that the arm stays in the place of stars; if nothing prevents you from it or does not change anything over you out of the broken bone.
If it is necessary to use a tool because something protrudes over you from a broken bone, then use tongs; and place the wider and stronger one on the actual fracture with the other smaller ones. And place among all the tongs the width of your finger, and let the length of the tongs correspond to the fracture with an additional three fingers from every side.
Then tighten the bandage over the tongs as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And it should be that your bandage is tighter over the area of the fracture. And as long as the fracture extends more, let the bandage be smaller.
If therefore you see the position of the tongs and the bandage as we said when you immediately begin to treat the limb, then do: and if it is necessary because of an inflamed swelling, then loosen the bandage and the tongcups until the seventh day, as I mentioned.
Then consider the ligament for all three days so that it does not occur at a place of itching, or swelling, or obstructed food from reaching the limb because of the excessive tightness of the bandage. Therefore correct this whole thing as I mentioned.
If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
And let there be lying of the patient on his back, and his hand over his belly: and place under the assistance full wool evenly.
And look at every hour of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened, nor does the bandage soften. Therefore correct this whole thing with your strength.
And place food for the patient according to the order we mentioned earlier, so that it is a light food first until his mouth tightens: then it is necessary that he eats thickened food.
Therefore, since it has been customary to tighten and bind the leg for forty days: then it should be loosened, and a bath should be administeramofted, and treated with ointments that correct this issue.
If the fracture is severe, it must be ground down; then do not loosen that ligament and splint for fifty days or so until two months have passed.
Regarding the restoration of a humerus fracture.
The arm is composed of two bones called the upper and lower epiphyses.
One (of them) is a short length, and it is that which follows the thumb. The other (one) is large, and it is that which lies beneath the small one from its lower part.
Therefore, perhaps the larger bone breaks easily alone, or the short one; and sometimes they break at the same time.
Whenever the upper short part breaks easily, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower large one breaks easily, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
And worse still (is), when both bones break at once.
If (then), the bone that breaks easily is the upper short one, then it behoovs the physician in its restoration to place an extension of the short part with ease until it heals equally.
But if (then), the large bone that breaks easily is broken: then it must be placed in a much stronger binding.
And it should be put (a position) like the hand amid its restoration, and its extension extended over the forearm. And (then) the thumb of the hand should be higher than all other fingers: and (the wrist joint should be lower than) all other digits or others; and (the arm bone with its fracture) seated firmly above itself, and (its position should be such that it faces toward the body), upright in altitude so as not to cause lameness of the arm.
Then the assistant should straighten the patient'cuestick with his hand or with a bandage. And another assistant should similarly straighten from above.
Then the doctor shall align the jaw and reduce it until he can achieve as good a shape as possible.
If there are bone fragments in the fracture, then try to reduce the entire piece back into its place with your strength.
If however a separate sathaiatum is apparent and it punctures the skin and there is no hope for its restoration: then finish on that point, and remove the piece according to the method which we discussed previously.
If however there is a fracture with an ulcer, I have already made that chapter special, so take the treatment from there on.
If it happens at the beginning of your restoration that a warm swelling occurs, then line a cloth with fat made into grease from rose oil, and white wax, so as to be an intermediate between thickness and thinness: and press the cloth onto the fibrillation gently. When the swelling is subsided, remove the wax, and apply an ointment prepared from mill powder mixed with albumen. Then place screws, and put the screw that is placed over the fracture itself slightly wider but stronger.
And know that there are six screws in the elbow for multiple dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one joint or in two joints simultaneously.
Then place your splint over the stronger and more severe part of the fastermental fracture, or somewhat closer to the upper or lower end of that fracture: or place a softer splint slightly closer according to what preceded at the beginning of the chapter.
And there are cloths that surround over the fastermental function which are soft and moist; and they should not be hard or rough. And let the thread that is used for tying be made of flax by nature, a medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
Consider the limb and the ligament after days. If something occurs that requires correction, such as an itch occurratur on the limb: then one must embroce the limb with heated water, until the itch ceases, and let the limb be untied until it rests; afterwards, perform another tying procedure.
If the bandaging has already been softened and the bone is now removed, and other similar things: then you should correct that whole thing with your strength, and consider it again.
For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of bandaging, then you must soften it slightly, and let the limb be untied for a few days, until it reaches the nourishment, and then bind it again.
However, if nothing of what we said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary for it to be untied, unless after twenty days or so.
Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck. And let their neck be straightened, and be protected by their own strength against violent movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this kind of fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it may be restored in eighteen days. All of this is according to the composition of temperaments, and the strengths.
¶ About the restoration of fractured hands.
Know that the knuckles of the hand and the toes rarely suffer a fancied bone (fracture). And it does not happen to them unless they are rubbed many times.
But when the foot suffers a bone (fracture) or rubbing: then it is necessary for the patient to be seated in a squared position: and that seat should have equality. Then place his hand over the extended one.
Then let the assistant stretch out the broken bones, and make sure that he joins them together with good union until they are properly united.
Then it is necessary for him to apply a plaster and bandage, unless there is hot inflammamen. Then place the splint above according to the quantity of space; and now you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
But if the fracture is near to the lower part of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to press it together with his broken foot-part; afterwards, wrap it with a long piece of cloth.
And let the splint be made from leather where there is flexibility, so that it can be applied with the foot-body; and bind it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it must be placed: that you put one splint from above, and another below in the foot-sole; and let the hand be open straight. Then place a binding as though it were restored with hands: and stretch between the fingers with a bandage.
But if there is a broken of some knuckles, then if it is the thumb, make sure that they are joined as needed. Then bind with the sole of the foot; and if possible, put on him a straight splint, smoothly made: so that the frugalness may be moved, and not move.
But if the fracture is on other digits, as the middle finger, or index, or ear-finger, and ring-finger, then make them even, and bind with the adjacent healthy digit that follows it; or bind all together according to their continuation: and this is better. Or place over it a smooth splint, as we said of the thumb.
And consider in your restoration and after the placement of hot inflammation: and apply with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to its account's procedure.
On the restoration of a hip fracture.
The hip bone is often fractured and it presents as follows: because it turns to the inner and rear parts.
And its restoration takes place in such a way that above the faster is tied with a suture, and another suture is below the fracture. And the patient should be stretched over his own face.
Then extends all the bandage material to its side according to equality: and this, when there is a functional dislocation of the bone.
But if it is a functional dislocation near the root of the hip bone, then there should be another suture to its side, so that extension goes upwards: and another suture below the fracture.
And thus similarly if it is a functional dislocation near the knee, then there should be another suture near the knee, so that extension goes downwards.
Then the physician equates both bones with his own hands until it is restored according to the similarity of the natural shape: and the bone is joined by a good union.
Then one must put on an ointment and a dressing, if no inflammation occurs in the limb. But if that happens to be an inflammation: then dismiss it for a few days until the heat of inflammebar has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
And its dressing should be like this. It is necessary to cover over the bone at its strongest point, that is, with a bandage: and double it twice or thrice: and some of it should remain on top. Then cover the leg until the heel reaches near the root of the buttocks.
And insert a long thread between the hip bone and the leg near the knee towards downwards, and let both ends of the string come from the upper parts of two limbs. Then roll over the leg and the hip bone that some comes from the strongest point.
Then place over the thigh at the location of its own studs, and place one star above the shin bone.
Then fill the void between the leg and the thigh with soft bandages to make it even.
Then begin wrapping tightly around the narrowing at the midpoint of three folds or four. And as long as you stretch with the bandage from the site of the fracture, your constriction should be smaller and softer, and more flexible.
Then turn to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg. Therefore bind with all three stars above them. Then advance with both ends of the thread to the bottom until you reach the shoe nail (heel). And also tighten both ends and the sides of the stars, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then remove the constriction over that area while keeping it in place so that no harm comes to the limb by ulceration, neither abscesses, nor swelling, and similar things. If something happens from there. (The translation ends here as the original text seems incomplete or possibly corrupted.) Therefore proceed with its treatment, and correct whatever has happened there completely, as we have said many times. (Continues from a previous instruction that isn't provided here.)
If indeed there is a fragment of bone within the bone that hurts: then it must be as level with you as possible if possible. (Could relate to an earlier instruction about treating complications like bone fragments.) And if not, find above that and remove it: and take care of the patient as per recall until healed. (Continues with instructions for removing foreign objects or fragments.)
And whenever this thigh bone fracture is being bound, besides adding to it stars as we said with support and arm. (This refers back to earlier instructions about the method of binding a fracture.)
However, in its healing that way for the broken bone, it does not cause weakness or limping. (Could relate to follow-up care and expected outcomes after treatment.) And if only one is restored, besides applying another arm to him, then it is necessary that the person who has it always limps.
And you know that the hip is constrained for fifty days, or it decreases slightly, or increases slightly; all of this depends on various temperaments and other dispositions.
Regarding the healing of a tibia fracture.
And you know that a fracture of the knee cap is rarely encountered, but it often happens due to wear and tear.
But if indeed a fracture occurs, then only through either a crack or an opening within its parts. And it is both with and without wound. And the treatment of this is entirely dependent on judgment.
And the restoration of it is such that what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers should heal, until joined together, and be united as much as possible in proportion, and construction.
Then place a plaster made of millet flour or mill wheat with egg white on it; and place over that round cast if you find one; and wrap tightly above the bandage corresponding to this.
Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as warm abscesses and similar things; so that you oppose every accident with what suits it until healed.
Regarding the healing of a femur fracture.
And you know that the shin has two bones, one of which is thick and is named by its own name, and the other is thin and is called the ankle.
And both of these have the kind of fracture that occurs in two arm bones; and because of this, its restoration is like the arm's restoration equally, and the operation is one.
If two bones are broken at once, the leg is bent in all directions.
And if a bone breaks subtly, the leg is bent towards the front part.
And if a bebone breaks significantly, you will find it below; and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Then give an extension, and make it equal, and bind the stars (bones) accordingly in an even manner.
However, if the thigh is a dirty fracture with many fragments: let there be a smaller extension and a milder reduction by your hand.
And indeed in the thigh there is something from an operation on the arm: and it is done as when you equalize (the bones), and complete your whole operation, then take two pieces of fascia from pine wood which are used in making sun-shades that lie under boards: and they are made with spoons of the palm; and choose among them those of small bulk, and not out of chips; and their length is according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Then apply a bandage over each piece with two layers according to its length. And place one part of the thigh from one side and the other from the opposite side: so that it is from the knee to below the foot.
Then bind two pieces with ligatures at three places - two ends, and middle. For indeed when contraction is prevented (by a splint), the thigh leans to the right and left, but maintains a good position.
And indeed (it would be administered) a cradle from wood according to the length of the thigh, and it should be placed there so as to conserve its position by not moving.
And very much indeed is required that you make this (device) for a fracture when it has a proper wound.
Then carefully observe the crust at all times and study it thoroughly from the last stage of separation or inflation, or any other remaining stages. If therefore anything happens from those (conditions), then apply to it what is necessary, until healed, if God wills it.
Of the fracture of foot bones and fingers.
However, a deep fracture does not occur in the heel.
However, a fracture does indeed occur to the foot bones and also rarely to the fingers; and it does not happen to them except from friction in various dispositions.
What if a faster occurs to the foot bones and he sees that (the bone) lifts up over itself towards the sky, then the sick person should place his own foot on prepared ground, as walking.
Then stand still, and place your foot over what is lifted from those bones: afterwards press it (the bone), or strike it with the heel; and straighten it completely until it returns to its places.
Then place a bandage on it, and stuff (it) from above; and place under the foot a board that is thin, to which there are two flat heads.
Then bind it with a decent bandage after you have warmed it with cloths and the other necessary things (like ointments).
However when three or four days pass by, then loosen the bandage. For you will find that (the bone) is straightened out if it is broken or displaced (from its position). Therefore the operation is as follows, as you see.
If however some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what you have told me about the restoration of hand fingers. Then place on your finger the splint according to its length and let it be a little wider: then place under the foot this board that I have told you about, and bind it with a decent bandleteh.
If indeed what is broken consists of two, or three, or more bones, then place over the entire finger a bandage of its kind in linen woven fabric: and tightly bind a board on the lower part of the foot; and let it stand with one end of the board outside the foot to maintain good retention.
And it befits you not to forget, but that you consider all things which I have said to you regarding the other breaks from accidents of which we have spoken: and apply to each accident what is necessary.
§ Regarding the break of a woman's womb, and the inner bone, and her husband.
When a woman's womb is broken, then make it sit in a square posture. (Note: This translation might be part of the original text discussing treatment for certain injuries.) Then lean her slightly toward the backside of herself, and let it be held at the rear. (Note: This translation might also come from a medical text discussing positioning for treatment or recovery.)
Then an accoucheuse fills her womb with a vessel until it is filled; and let it be made into the womb as if into a sphere. (Note: This translation might refer to procedures performed by midwives or medical practitioners in historical contexts.)
Then shake the woman and elevate her back gradually. (Note: This could be part of a description for post-treatment care or rehabilitation exercises in historical medical practices.) For indeed the vessel is expelled out when it becomes before the opening of the womb like a sphere, and the broken bone returns. (Note: This translation may refer to post-parturition processes or recovery stages in historical medical texts.)
Then place the pillow over her back. (Note: This might be a piece of advice for patient comfort and support following treatment.) Whenever she wishes to urinate, remove the vessel with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to how you first inserted it; then let it return to its original pillow. (Note: This could be part of instructions related to postoperative care or managing medical devices in historical texts.)
Do this for seven days, or approximately; for the bone is indeed restored. (Note: This might relate to a period of recovery or rehabilitation as described in ancient medical literature.)
And if you have a bladder, take the leather bag of the bladprise an iron tube over its opening and insert the entire sack into it. Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the bag and heals a crack.
Then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days as we have mentioned until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pectineal (pubic) breaks or that of a woman, then apply to its restoration and perform that specific fitting we have described on the bone of Ankle.
And do not neglect the rectum in these nearby fractures which are few and far between, especially if something is studied or used.
And understand my book well because the fracture itself signifies to you many correct paths for restoration and ligation of it: therefore, understand this.
However, when the penis is broken, take a goose's neck and insert the penis into it. Then place a fold made of cloth on it and wrap it up, and leave for about three days or so, and heal if God wills.
¶ For the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
It happens to him who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large like the bone of the hip or an assistant, or similar ones such as screws and venesections: if you find that the conditions of venesection are attested to you as we have mentioned before.
If the wound bleeds blood, then one should as screws do a cutting off of it by applying powdered zege over it: if nothing else is present to you.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it if an abscess does not occur.
If indeed there is a hot abscess, then postpone the restoration of it until the ninth day, when the abscess has settled down. And do not approach it on the third or fourth days at all, for you will cause him to suffer bad consequences.
However, if the bone is protrude over the skin detected: then you must discuss how to reduce it and balance it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
However, if no extension of it has been prepared, and its balancing by your hands: then reduce it with this instrument. And there is an instrument made of iron, whose length corresponds to the quantity of seven fingers or eight: and its width according to the quantity of wounds. And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four according to the quantity needed for that from the healing of every kind of fracture.
And it is round: and let there be a small thickness that does not double during the compression on top of it at the time of operation: and have sharp edges, with an edge on its edges. And its upper part has a thickness to its half up to its lower part.
And this is the form of it.
It is necessary that in this operation, the sharp end of it be bent over the prominent bone's edge: and push it with a single force until when the bone returns and reaches an equal balancing.
Then try to balance the edges of the fracture evenly.
That if the edges of it are subtle, and do not receive her by good acceptance, then you must cut the edge of that bacteria until the instrument has its strength.
If indeed you cannot bring them back together as we have described overall, then incise it with what is fitting from the cutting instruments that we mentioned: either saw it with a single saw in whatever way possible for you.
Then scrape off the remaining part from the bone due to roughness and small scales.
But when the bone is reduced and finds an intense pain after its reduction that injures him, then know that the b groan did not return to its natural place.
So do that. For you bring great pain to the patient when completing the bone restoration that you are making.
Then soak the bandage in astringent black wine. And properly if it is summer. (This instruction seems to be part of another context and does not form an understandable And do not place anything on a purulent wound, nor apply any oil, so that it does not happen to decay and corruption in it.
Then give the astrolabe during your completion of bone restoration. (This sentence seems out of context; an astrolabe is unrelated to surgery, so please provide additional information for accurate translation if necessary.) And dismiss the detected wound: that is, cut with forceps a hole in the scar tissue according to the amount of the wound. (This sentence may require further contextual information as "dimittere" typically means to send away or release, which could be interpreted differently within medical procedures.)
And with every precaution, do not tighten a wound with a fracture. (Note: This sentence might require clarification as "stringere" can mean to press or compress; context is essential Many times these foolish doctors have done this to their patients: they caused either death, or rot, or fever, that is, health. (The translation seems a bit unusual due to the ambiguous nature of "saneam," which might not directly translate into English as 'health'; it may require contextual understanding.) And let your suture be soft, gentle, a different kind of residual fracture sutures. (This sentence may need additional context to properly translate "mollis" and "lenis," which can both mean mild or smooth but might have specific implications in surgical terminology
If the wound is bad or it is a large wnund, and there are some unfortunate events occurrab that we have mentioned above, and if you find pain in the swelling: then it does not need to be placed with spikes over it. And make them contractures from hardened leather pieces at the place of spikes, and tighten it with those things.
But when it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above that leather cloth which was placed over it with wine. Then apply the liniment and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacic ointanthropic oil, and similar things.
And it suits you, that you should dissolve the sinew. And pay attention to the wound every day morning and evening until it consolidates and heals.
And it is necessary that you prepare the limb so that it runs with pus towards the lower part easily.
But if there are many days of wounds passing, and it does not solidify nor the pwart is separated from that: then you know that there are crumbs of bone at this place. Therefore, it is necessary to inquire about the wound with probes. How many of those crumbs are separated, remove them and extract that thing itself. And which of them are not separated and puncture the limb and cause pain to happen, try to cut those things and remove as much as possible for you that can be done.
But if it happens that wounds are gnawed or bitten, that is, erythema, or other species of corruption and putrefaction: then you must oppose to each of them with what suits him from the cure, as was told in its chapter itself.
And from there where it is necessary that my speech remains, and to whom you make your present mind when the bone breaks and protrudes over a limb, such as the hipbone, and assistants, and similar things from large limbs, so that you do not presume its attraction, often enough death occurs from this, indeed let it go until it putrefies.
Perhaps after ninety or thirty days he may drop off by himself.
Then indeed care for the wound if it seems to you: but if not, let it go.
Of healing of a hernia during signs of bone fracture.
Often it happens that this hernia occurs during signs of bone fracture healing. Especially one near the joints: and swells from such a shape of limb. And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function after surgery.
Consider then if the hernia is recent: apply to it medicines which have astaing quality, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, resin, and acacia, and similar things.
Thus that you receive from these some or all of them: and make it with astringent wine, or with egg white, or vineger: and put over the hernia on cotton wool, and bind them above the good binding.
And do not loosen the bandaging for many days. Then dissolve it and make another one, until the hernia is removed.
Or bind over itself a sheet of lead properly. For lead indeed has the property to remove anything feared from limbs.
But if the herniated node is already turned into stone and bound, and quickly provoke the need to remove it: then cut from above its upper part, and incise any protruding excess: or scrape off with some scrapers until removed: and care for it, until healed.
"Concerning the healing when it is restored, and a body part remains delicate, not according to its own nature.
"When a bone is healed and the part remains delicate and weak, then it does not happen because of many causes. "One of them is the excessive solubility and ligation of that ligament which does not occur as it should: either because of the surplus tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or due to an excessive embrocation inappropriate for its time; or because of the scarcity of blood in a weakened body and its frailty.
"And the treatment for that is to feed the sick person and make their body tender until blood multiplies within them. "And administer a bath. "And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
"Then place sulfur on the limb so that it may attract a great amount of nourishment to it. "And apply constant embrocation with warm water until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
"Regarding the healing of bent bones when they are restored in a crooked manner.
"When a limb already restored after its healing has crookedness and the prominence of the fractured bone or knotting: and it is marred in that form of body parts, however it does not prevent the part from performing its natural operation: then you should not accept the speech which assumes that the limb will break anew.
"And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who did this on our land.
"And indeed, this operation is greatly blameable, leading to death or great fear that it is mortal.
But if the claudication and swelling are recent: then one should be bathed with warm water in which soaked herbs that soften have been cooked, such as the leaves of yarrow, its root, and mallows, and similar ones. And let an ointment be made with a soothing plaster, like the one made of henbane, properly prepared.
Or let a slime be taken from the root of yarrow and stirred with goose fat or sesame oil, and applied with it as an ointamo.
Or let they take the fat of figs and rub with white lead, and apply similar ones which are called from diminishing congealing medicines.
And the swelling is loosened with constant rubbing, ancient and gentle, which is done with moist hands. And administer a movement of the limb to every part at all hours.
But if a twisting has already preceded it, and become strong, and turned into a stone, and the need for its cure was provoked with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and dissolve continuation of bone, and incise what protrudes from nodulation or bone with subtle scissors: and administer ease in this with solicitude and study.
§ From speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is the outcome of certain joints being out of their place. Why it is forbidden from its own motion and spoils the shape of limbs. And causes intense pains to happen on the sickly one, and severe injuries.
Whenever a dislocation happens to anyone, then it must hurry to its restoration: do not delay it at all.
For if delayed, the place is left behind, and perhaps with that reduction of dislocation.
Therefore, it is not necessary for it to move or be extended at the time of its inflammader. Since it often causes a spasm and painful injuries.
However, when this occurs, it is necessary to hasten to perform venesection by the nurse. Then it should be dismissed until the inflammation subsides.
Then bathe the limb with warm water and oil. Then gently reduce it.
And care for the entire limb as if nothing happened at its proper place.
Indeed, I have already ordered chapters on dislocations, even following the progression of an injury from upper to lower parts of the body.
¶ On treating a lower jaw dislocation.
Two lower jaws are rarely displaced.
And dislocation of the temporomandibular joint occurs in one of two ways. Or indeed they are slightly removed from their places and softened to some extent. Or they are fully dislocated until softened to the chest part, until a nurse can run over it, and cannot hold it, nor close their mouth, and is rolled out with their tongue while speaking.
But when that displacement is slight, then it returns to several dispositions by itself with a few treatments.
However, if it is complete and total displacement: then one must administer its reduction quickly, and not delay fully; and that the nurse holds their head: and inserts a doctor's single thumb into the root of Mandibular joint dislocation between the bones, if the displacement is from one side. Or they insert their two thumbs at once, if the dispunction is from both sides. And the remaining fingers of his hand are placed outwardly to stabilize them.
And command the patient to cleanse his jawbones and make them suitable for chewing on every side. And the doctor straightens the mandible and moves it until it returns to its place.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are involved at once: then administer a poultice with warm water and oil, until the reduction of the jawbones becomes easy; do not make any reductions too slowly, as we have said before.
And so when they return and align properly, the wound of the patient is closed, but not softened: then place small cloths over them, with a bandage made from beeswax; and rose oil.
And it should then be bound easily with soft bands.
And the patient should have sleep on his back: and his head should be held between two bandages so that it does not move to the right or left; nor should he be forced or allowed to chew anything: indeed, he should take in his food gently until pains subside and the mandible is loose; then he may eat what he wants, and administer medicine easily.
He should not work during eating and drinking, and sleep until the mandible loosens and heals.
If it is difficult to reduce two dislocated mandibles at some point and they do not return to their places: then there are often fevers that follow from this; and a constant thirst: and perhaps the patient's spleen releases, and perhaps he vomits clear bile.
And so when you see that: then know it is a loss; and the person to whom this happens often dies within ten days.
Regarding the reduction of dislocations of the furcula and arm ends.
Chapter 26. Indeed, the wishbone is not dislocated from its inner side due to its continuous connection with the breast. And it can sometimes be dislodged externally; and that is described as follows. (Note: This translation assumes a continuation of Albucasis's work discussing possible
And its restoration involves it lying weak on its back and extending its arms. (Note: This translation refers to a method described by Albucasis for treating an injured wishbone.) Then compress the site with your strong hand, for it will return itself. (Note: This translation reflects a technique from Albucasis's surgical practice related to setting bones.)
Then place over the plaster, and small bandages, and bind it tightly. (Note: This is a typical instruction from Albucasis's era on securing a dressing or splint.)
However, the extremities that follow (extend from) the elbow continue with it and do not dislocate unless rarely. (Note: This statement likely pertains to anatomical observations made by Albucasis regarding joint articulations.) Which if it is displaced on any day: then one must ensure that it is reduced and aligned as we have described, and prepared in the manner provided for you. (Note: This sentence gives guidance to a surgeon regarding steps to take when a dislocation occurs.)
Then place over it a plaster, and bandages, and a binding. (Note: This instruction is part of the method for setting or immobilizing an affected area after reduction.) And instruct the patient to adhere to peace and rest until healed. (Note: This is a common closing remark in Albucasis's treatments that emphasizes the importance of rest for recovery.)
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it has also been separated from its place. (Note: This likely refers to instructions for reducing a dislocation at the shoulder joint.)
§ On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus. (Note: Here, we might expect Albucasis to
Know that the humerus is not dislocated unless by three methods. (Note: This would introduce a section where Albucasis specifies different mechanisms of dislocation for the humerus.)
Of which one is that it dislocates to the lower end of the ball and socket joint. (Note: This statement likely explains a specific type of shoulder dislocation Albucasis details in his work.) Secondly, it should be dislocated to the chest side. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
And it should not be dislocated towards the back, due to the spatula. And it should not be dislocated toward the front, because of nerves.
And indeed very often it is dislocated and slips downward toward the anal region: especially in those whose flesh is scarce. Since it quickly proceeds out of them, and just as quickly enters again.
However, in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite occurs, namely because it proceeds out with difficulty and enters again with difficulty.
And sometimes it happens in some people due to a blow or accident and the humerus becomes inflamed with heat and is assumed to be because of this fact that it was already displaced.
Therefore, you should examine this thing until certainty is obtained about it and then proceed with its treatment.
And the displacement is known when it is towards the anal region: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerum. For you found among them manifest difference, and in the head of the humerus you find concavity, and under the anal region at touch it appears as though the head of the humerus itself were absent: and the weak person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with any motion.
And similarly, if displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, which is not hidden.
And indeed this displacement can be easily reduced when it is recent, or the boy is weak.
And its reduction is as follows: that he guides his hand upwards with a spatula. Then place your thumbs under the anal region of that thing and guide the joint with strength upwards to its own position: and let him guide his hand with it and stretch it upwards. Then he should place it lower down; for indeed he returns quickly.
But if he does not return through that which we mentioned, and there are several days from the beginning when dislocation occurs: then it is necessary for him to bathe sickly in warm water, and administer an embrocation that soothes and alleviates, as if boiled roots were strained into the water, along with fenugreek and mallow.
Then let the sick person lie on their back: and place under the tickling sphere and wool, which is equal in softness and tightening.
Then let the doctor place their heel over the sphere, and loosen the neck of the shoulder with strength, and draw the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts.
And if possible, guide him back according to this method: and it is as to make present men who are taller than the sick person, stand on one side, and insert their arm under the tickling of the sick person: and loosen the tickling towards the upper parts until the sick person is suspended in air. And another servant draws the hand of the sick person to his lower rib. But if the sick person is light: then it is necessary for him to be suspended with something else so that he may feel burdened: for the dislocation returns immediately.
And he is also guided back according to another method: and it is as if he were fashioned on the ground with a long piece of wood whose head is round like a pottery sleeve: which is not thick nor thin. Then let be placed under the sick person after placing clothes gently over the head of the wood: and let the sickwart stand according to the length of the wood.
Then let his hand be extended to the lower part on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with strength: for the joint returns quickly to its place.
If it is difficult to reposition it as we have described, then use this method with care: the wood should be of a length equal to the quantity of two forearms, its width equivalent to the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness equal to the quantity of two fingers; the head should be round in order to facilitate entry into the depth of the wound according to this form.
Then the bandages are tied loosely above the rounded head with soft cloths so as not to injure the weak wood.
Then it should be placed under the weakened wound so that the hand or arm is extended to reach up to the bottom; and it should be fastened with wood over the support, arm, and end of the hand.
Then the arm should be placed over the width of the ladder step and extended to reach downward; and the remaining body weight should be let down from one side. However, the connection is made immediately.
Thus when the entrance is completed in whatever possible way it can be: then you should place under the wound a ball equal in quantity of woolen yarn. Then place an applied plaster prepared from mill powder and frankincense on the entire upper arm as it recoiled upwards.
Then a fitting bandage should be tightly tied under the wound; and the ligament should recoil over the plaster from above: then it should be attached to its own neck, and let down without moving its hand for seven days.
And it should be placed food that nourishes the weak foot until it is comforted by its limb; for this hastens its healing.
Then a larger bandage should be placed after seven or five days, and one should get up with movement. If it then becomes firmer and does not soften, then it is already healed.
If however the connection becomes dislocated many times, because of moisture that happens to it or due to another cause: then you should administer there a caustic with three openings as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
If this is done completely and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the joint does not heal, and the bandage is reduced several times, and it does not solidify, but gives way, and one cannot elevate it to above: then you know that the nerves of his who are near the head of the shoulder are already cut, extended, or softened; and you know that the joint will never join again in its place.
However, dislocations that occur towards the chest and nipple, or backward reduction, occurs with thrusting and extending with hands: until it returns, and a bandage is applied there as well as care, until healed.
But if this happens after healing, heaviness in the limb and slowness of its movement, then it is used often to weak baths until that heaviness relaxes, and returns to its original state.
§ On curing elbow dislocations.
Know that the joint of the elbow is displaced with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty as well: indeed it is displaced to all parts, especially towards the front or back.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever shape it becomes displaced. And when the joined elbow is displaced with a healthy one, it is declared to you manifestly. For indeed the joint contracts and cannot double the arm nor touch its own humerus.
And you must hurry to reduce the displacement immediately before a hot abscess occurs in him.
For if this happens to him as a hot abscess, it is difficult for his reduction: and perhaps he does not cure at all, especially when it is towards the back. For indeed it is worse than all kinds of displacements, and they have more intense pain from them: and often descends with that death.
Then its restoration, when it can be reduced from those that are possible, is to extend its hand with two hands: and its arm is spread out, and the doctor's hands are above and below it, and he pushes the joint along with his own thumbs at the same time or at the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns in such a way that its hand doubles with his own hand, until he hits with the root of his palm the arm which has been dislocated.
If the dislocation does not oblige to reduction, then he administers strong and vigorous stretching: and it is so that two attendants extend its arm; and they hold it with both hands as well, so that it may not slip off during the stretching.
Then its arm is restored to all parts after it has been rolled up with a long cloth or broad bandage on his hand.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he anoints it with oil; so that it may be one of those that help in providing lubrication to the joint for ease. Then he pushes the joint with vigorous thrusting until it returns.
And after its restoration, it should be placed on top of the plaster itself, which has astringency and decoction with millet husk; and tightly bound bandage is applied appropriamely. And its arm is hung from the bed of the patient: and it should be released for several days.
Then it should be dissolved. If however the joint is fixed in its place, then dissolve that bandage and release it.
And if you see the joint is not well bound, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and release it for several days until tightly bound. Then dissolve it.
If however there is swelling after the reduction of the joint and the situation is in motion: then administer moisturizing in bathing, gentle friction, and compression, until it lignifies, or place over the joint jilti, that is, sheep'amoeba ice cream. Then it is tied, and let it rest on itself during the day and night. Then remove it and insert into a bath. Therefore when it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then apply over itself jilti one, and second, and third time at bathing entrance until soothening.
And if so, place over itself dung of goat's wool, moist, heated with butter, and bind tightly to it.
Do that several times. (This is the last instruction in Latin) For she herself soothens, and returns to her own disposal. (The final outcome of the procedure according to the text.)
§ About treating the dislocation Albucasis. (This seems like a header for additional instructions or context related to Albucasis's treatment methods.)
Albucasis arms are often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and hand. (This appears to be a statement introducing the topic of arm dislocation in relation to Albucascases's treatments.)
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. (A continuation from the previous line, indicating that treating this particular type of dis On the contrary, other joints. (This seems to begin a comparison between different types of joint treatments.) However, speed must be in the reduction of its dislocation at the time it becomes dislocated before the place can swell up: or a hot swelling happens there. (Here we see advice on how to act promptly during arm dislocation.)
And the reduction of dislocation is such that you place Mahassem's weak arm on a table and extend it with your hand: and the doctor places his own palm over the bulge of the joint, and pushes until it returns to position. (This sentence appears to be an instruction for performing a specific treatment maneuver.)
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already withdrawoff from the hand's forearm: then place the weak back of his own hand on a board near extension and reduction; and if there is an ongoing dislocation towards the back of the hand, then position that hand internally over the board, that is, the inner part of that hand should be placed over the board so that the doctor's hand falls upon the same prominence of the joint.
However, if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it tightly with a soothing ointment for the sore and release it, without any bandages on that.
For if it cannot tolerate, nor can you go over its reduction after some days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own crookedness; and nothing harms the sick person except that it soothes his hand, and he cannot be bound: then know, the nerves are either cut off or worn away.
Therefore, there is no skill in this except that it should be tightly seared with a caustic near the site of its injury. And perhaps it does not provide anything at all.
But if Al-Mahasen does not return, then place over that ointment which we have mentioned. Then it is bound and released after five days; afterwards it is loosened and released, and the hand is exercised.
But if motion is impeded and something of importance occurs therein: then gently bathe it with warm water, and rub occasionally until softened.
Regarding the treatment of digit dislocations.
When a digit is dislocated towards any of its parts, or towards the back of the palm or forearm: then extend the digit and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger and suspend it toward the side to which it is dislocated, and release it for two days.
Then hang it up and extend it until it straightens on that day itself.
When the night comes, bind it as described above: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do that for several days until it is taut.
And do the same for him if he is dislocated to the wrist of the hand: and bind it to the said part, and perform with him your first procedure until it heals.
And similarly do that for him when he is dislocated to other parts.
§ Of the treatment of spinal column dislocation.
When it happens to someone a spinal column dislocation or a complete neck dislocation with many vertebrae displaced from their places: then there is no cure for him, since death approaches the sick person.
And the sign of that is that the sick person goes out in a state of waste without will, and cannot keep it: and often they become softened from him some limbs of his, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them: or a vertebra moves away from its place.
For often it is displaced that often the removal happens to four parts.
Thus what moves towards the back is called humpiness.
However, its treatment is that then you consider if humpiness happens from childhood: then there is no cure for him at all, nor healing from it at all.
In that however which happens by chance, or by blows, or similar things, the old have already said long treatments in words. The use of which yields little with practice.
But indeed I have already obtained permission from him, which little excuses by its nearness to my intent: and from my explanation in which I exposed that, and the shaping of his instrument differently from what they showed it and explained.
Therefore, I say, that in the swelling which occurs on the previous part, there is no talent or healing from it.
And similarly in those occurring to both sides as well.
And they are not treated from them unless those occurring in the back properly, as I narrate: and it is so that it extends weak over its face on a level near the wall: and spreads underneath a wet lining, so that it does not hurt its chest.
Then a straight wood is to be placed fixed into the hole on the ground at about the head of its foot: and another wood approximately at its feet at the other end of its foot: and the attendant holds the wood, not being fastened in the hole. And the second servant holds the other one.
Then over the head of the sick one is drawn a string loosely, and extended at its ligament below tightly: and extends the end of the ligament to the wood which is near its head: and binds it there.
Then a string over its wings, and above its knees, and at its heels. Then all the strings are tied together, and they bind them to the other wood which is near its feet.
Then each servant extends to the strings at the wood's side of the string: and do not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed: but truly they are not fastened, as I said.
And the doctor puts his hands with strength over the spine until it returns: or he places them on a board. Then he attaches his feet to a board until he is restored.
If however he does not recover through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits. And cut into the wall of which we spoke that is near the patient, a place where the board can be inserted. Then put the middle board over the spine. And the physician should then place his feet on the other end. And tighten well, until the spine is curved, and he returns to his position.
Then if you wish, work with a turner as follows: it is to make two pieces of wood on the ground next to the head of the patient, whose length is equal to one cubit; and also at the end of his feet two pieces of wood.
And the length between all pieces of wood is one span; and now an opening has been made everywhere where the turner's wheel runs through; and fix every piece of wood to the ground firmly so that it may not move at all.
And insert a round piece of wood; and the turner's wheel is in which the ligament turns through two openings between the pieces of wood.
And at the end there is an opening where they fix a piece of wood, whose length is one span as it turned through; and in the two other pieces of wood also similar to this.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have strapped on the patient's chest with a turner who is at his head; and also the ligaments that you have strapped on his shanks with a turner who is at his feet.
Then stand near each turner's wheel with the lever, and use your hand to turn the wheel as it turns; and the physician straightens the spine according to what we have said.
This is the form of using a turner that follows.
Then, after Spondilus returns and the place is leveled, you must then set an ointment of linseed with white of egg. Next, make a plaster. Then place upon the ointamoan a plate made from wood whose width be three fingers or about that size. And its length and quantity should cover the space of Gibbositas, and above part of the healthy Spondilus.
Then it is tied with a bandage as we mentioned before. And let the sick be nourished with subtle food until healed.
And if something remains protruding at the end of healing in that place: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soothe and relieve with the application of a board as I mentioned for a long time. And now apply a plate of lead there.
And sometimes it happens that there is a protrusion at the very end of Spondilus's back: and it is thought to be through displacement, and that bone which now stands out. For it should not be presumed for him with this medicine: indeed perhaps it would bring death.
On the healing of a displaced Ancha.
Know that the joints of the Ancha and those of the shoulder do not occur, except for displacement alone: nor does it happen to them what happens to other separated and compressed joints.
And indeed the joint of the Ancha is displaced according to four parts. That is because it is displaired towards the front and back.
And mostly at all it is displaired inwards: and little displaired to the front and back.
And the cure of its inward displacement is as follows: because when you unite a healthy leg with an infirm one, it is longer: and that knee stands out more than that which is sound, and cannot double up its foot at the groin: and there is a place following the inflamed groin due to this, because the head of the hip has already arrived in that area.
And the mark of its external displacement is that they are contrary to those conditions.
And the sign of its displacement to the front is that it expands a healthy leg according to complementation: however, it does not duplicate without pain in the knee: and if one attempts to walk on it, they cannot manage over the front area: and urine retention occurs, and there is swelling in the groin, and during walking there is pressure under the heel.
And the sign of its displacement to the back is that it does not expand the knee, nor can it duplicate before swelling in the groin occurs: and one leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and there is a headache at the hip joint.
However, consider this reduction of these types of displacements, that if the displacement is old, it has become outdated with having it for a long time. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its nature: then there is no treatment at all for it. Therefore, one should not make the assumption that it is entirely healed.
However, in the case where the displacement is recent and it is from one of four types of dislocanguards: then do this promptly so that you can join the joints together, extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return on its own, and does not require any other treatment.
If however it does not return in this way, then one must prepare a strong remedy, and extend its leg from the lower part: or with his own hands, or with a band that is tied over its leg above the knee: and another servant should extend their hand downwards so as to insert their fingers under its ticklish areas. Then tie with a band gently over the hip bone root, and hold the other end of the ligament.
And its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the forequarter, or from the back part to the back.
And its extension is all in one piece, until it loosens and remains hanging with the body from the ground.
For this type of extension is a common type among four kinds of extensions.
If therefore there's a relapse to the displacement as we mentioned earlier, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary for each kind of extension its own proper treatment.
Indeed, in reducing that particular displacement when the displacement is towards the inside, it must be placed on its healthy side lying down. Then place a ligature over the root of the hipbone, where it is between the head of the hip bone and below the groin area. Then extend the ligature upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, towards the forequarter.
Then let another strong helper take its arms and reduce the swollen area of the disabled hip, and stretch it towards the outward extension firmly. Now then it returns to its place.
This type is easier among the remaining types of treatment, which reduces this limb.
But if he is not cooperating with you and does not comply to enter this entire type of treatment: then it must be, for two feet sick at once with a strong ligament over the calcanei (heels), and a weak one; and its length equal to four digits from his healthy side. And let the extension of the sick foot be longer than another by twice the size of two fingers.
Then hang the disabled person over the neck of a beam, which is inside the house; and let its length from the ground equal twice the size of two arms.
Then command a strong youth to guard the hipbone; and when you find another one with the disabled person: let another young man push him while he is securing the hip joint firmly because the connection returns quickly to its place.
However, in treating it itself, when there is a dislocation towards the outside, one must ensure that the sick person lies on a platform, as we described for those with humpbacks. And it binds the ligament over its leg and chest of itself.
Then two planks are placed, one at its feet and another at its head. Then an additional plasto is placed in the middle of its foot and secured well: on top of which wet cloths should be laid so as not to injure the sick person; and the wood should be between its thighs so that it does not pull towards the lower part during extension.
Then every assistant extends their own part, and the physician makes the reduction with his hand.
If it thus follows back to its position, that will be good.
And if not, place on top of the plank and press it as we mentioned with humpbacks, evenly. However, it is necessary that the sick person lies on its own healthy side.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it must be extended quickly on its leg: and according to this same description atop a platform: and the physician places his right hand's palm over the sick person's groin. Then it is compressed with his other hand and with that compression places it extended towards the lower part of the knee joint.
And if the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary for it to be extended downwards, and should be elevated on the ground; rather it must lie on a hard surface, as we also said earlier when discussing its lying between two humps: and over its face with tension of ligaments: according to what we mentioned recently.
And it is necessary that compression with a plank also be administered over the joint to which the dislocation has occurred, when completion of reduction occurs as needed.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person grips his leg, and expands it without excuse, then you know it has returned to its member as it should be: then join the two thighs together, and place a plaster, and bind with an emberlock, that is, a rope; so that the leg does not move at all towards any part: and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then dissolve the ligament, and apply plaster, and compare one leg with the other; then if you see them equal while at rest, then you know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore let the sick person walk again.
And if you see some softening: then make it return, and apply that plaster, and bind it according to your first bandaging; and let it also rest for three days.
Then dissolve it and make the person walk slowly on each foot for two more days, until it is well healed.
¶ Concerning Knee Dislocanguisf.
The Knee is displaced in three ways. It is displaced to the outside, the inside, and below (namely towards the back).
And it does not displace to the front.
And the sign of its displacement is that you instruct the sick person to apply their leg onto their hip. If however it does not stick with the thigh: then you know that the Knee is displaced.
And the restoration of all kinds of its displacement is to make the sick person sit upright, so that it can already extend its leg if possible onto yours and stick its back against your face; and place his foot between your feet. (Note: This translation instruction seems to be incomplete or improperly structured based on Albucasis's actual works)
Then fasten your knee together with your palms, and straighten those between your fingers over that knee. Then apply it with the palm of your hand on both sides of that knee firmly. And another assistant should stretch out his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of return is that the leg clings with the thigh gently, not strenuously.
Then apply plaster on it and make the leg stick to the thigh. Then bind it together with bandages for three or four days. Then loosen it.
And the patient should not walk lame for several days until healed.
But if it refuses to be reduced by you, then provide strong extension with ligaments, whose precedence is not described in the treatment of ankles, until it returns.
¶ Regarding the treatment of a heel displacement.
The heel is sometimes thrown off by slight shaking and at other times becomes displaced following a particular treatment. And its displacement occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
And the sign of its displacement is that you see the heel swollen and extending toward the side to which it becomes displaced.
But the cure of its displacement is an easy return: and it is by stretching out gently with your hands and making equal until it returns.
But during its treatment when it becomes displawed following a particular treatment, you should make the patient sit straight and let a strong assistant hold it firmly on his back, in the middle of itself.
Then with your right hand hold his foot from its upper part and with your left hand from its lower part at the heel's place.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then by two fingers of your left hand.
Then extend with the left hand and push the chest with the right foot against the thigh without effort.
Then do that twice, as we have told you.
Then push the chabest foot against the thigh with a force three times, and you will extract the bone fragment.
If therefore he returns with the force of one or two as described here and you see the foot even, that is good; but if not, then repeat the operation on him: for indeed he will return.
If however it is forbidden to you the reduction of him as we have said: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground and fix a stake firmly in the earth so that he falls between his thighs: and you now wrap a cloth around him so that he does not injure the sick.
Then let the attendant take his thighs: then the other attendant should stretch one foot with their own hands or with a band that is tied over his calf. Then all attendants should stretch against the extension of his companion: and the stake stands between the two thighs of the sick person holding him so that his body is not attracted towards the lower near the extension.
Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with their own hands and another attendant holds the healthy leg towards the bottom. For the dislocation returns quickly.
When however the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that he has regained health: then place a plaster and bandage, and tighten it with strong bands, and bind his foot with a band to the thigh.
And it is necessary that you check or cut the nerves that are above the heel backward, so that there be not a swollen ligament over them and damage them.
Then let him rest for two or three days. But if the ligament is softened, then tighten him again: and let them bathe him on the third or fourth day: and forbid the sick from walking for forty days. If indeed he wishes to walk before that space of time, there is no assurance but that the dislocation will be resolved and it will become corrupted, and will not receive any healing afterward.
If it happens to him a hot abscess: then he needs to administer an ointment on the sore area, as our treatment was described elsewhere, and rubbing until removed.
Concerning dislocation of the toe fingers, and its treatment.
It should be that which is dislocated from those with little extension without effort: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it should be made to sit with its own weakened foot on an even surface of the ground or over a board: and it stands as walking.
Then you stand and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints. Then the heel with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it already even, and not protrudes in the place of prominence.
Then place under his thigh a board that takes his foot entirely, which has two ends. Then bind it tightly with a decent bandage for three days. Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days until it is strained and secured by the reduction.
Concerning types of dislocations with ulcers or fractures.
When something happens to this, and you try its treatment, and restoration of itself, many times death succeeds: and for this reason it should not presume over this kind of cure, unless he is prudent in the art with long use, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor arrogant: and to use medicines that calm only hot abscesses, and to send away the weakened by divine judgment for a long time. Unless you hope or expect healing from destruction with mild illness, and where something appears to be hopeful. Therefore do the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the thing before a hot suppurate occurs.
If therefore the member returns as we wish, then apply a treatment that calms suppuration: and care for wounds with what suits it from dried ointments.
That if dislocation is with fracture, and it occurs in separated bone shards, then try the removal of them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from the approach of fear: according to what my prediction preceded for you.
For that is better for you with your Maker, and more lasting to your glory, and more of your body's health with them at your time.
