On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after their incision: and on the treatment of fissures.
Chapter 81.
Hemorrhoids exist in two forms.
They are either inside the anus, resembling blisters of charcoal or embers, or as if they were like grapes.
And among them are small and large ones; blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, or there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and on its edges.
However, those that are outside the anus usually have little moisture, from which yellowish fluid or a small amount of blood flows steadily, and they are the same color as the body.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit; then press, until the anus emerges, and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Therefore, suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If the hooks do not hold them, due to their moisture and softening, then grasp them with a rough cloth or woolen fabric, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders on them after the incision, so they act as a substitute for cauterization.
Or cauterize them as described previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to egress, then administer an enema with a mild irritant to cleanse the anus, and so that it yields to egress quickly when the patient presses.
If the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their treatment is light, easy: just grasp them with your fingernail or a hook and cut them.
Then treat them as described, until they heal.
And if someone shuns incision with iron, then it is necessary to perform their suture according to this method.
Take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards, and make the needle penetrate at its root from the other side; wrap the two ends of the thread at the lower part of the needle, laying them crosswise, and tie the hemorrhoid tightly.
Then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, but leave one unsutured so that excess blood may flow from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot oil on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it alone until it falls off.
When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the remaining care until they heal.
On the treatment of fissures.
They often occur due to the drying of stool and the constriction of nature.
When they become chronic and medicine has no effect, it is necessary to scrape them with the point of a Spatumila, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents them from healing is removed.
Then treat them until they heal properly.
If they do not heal, then repeat the scraping more vigorously than the first time until they bleed significantly and the surface is removed; then treat them until they heal.
