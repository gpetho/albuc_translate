The author of this book, having completed for you, my sons, this book which is a part of the complete science of medicine and having reached the limit of clarity and explanation in it, deemed it necessary to complete it with this article which is a part of practical work by hand.
Because practical work by hand in our country and in our time is completely non-existent, to the point that the science of it is nearly extinct and its trace is cut off. And what remains of it are merely a few illustrations in the books of the ancients, which hands have corrupted, and errors and confusion have occurred in them until their meanings became obscure and their benefits distant.
Therefore, I decided to revive it and compile this article in a way of explanation, clarity, and abbreviation, and to provide illustrations of cautery instruments and other tools used for practical work, as this adds to the clarity and helps understand what is needed.
And the reason there is no skilled craftsman in our time who can excel with his hands is because the study of medicine is extensive, and one must first engage in the study of anatomy, which Galen has described. Until he understands the benefits, forms, and temperaments of the organs, their connections and disconnections, knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, outlets, arteries, veins, and the locations of their outlets.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that there are many doctors in name but few in reality, especially in the craft of the hand. We have mentioned this partially in the introduction of this book.
Because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy may commit errors that kill people, as I have often witnessed with those who presume to know this science without knowledge or understanding.
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor who cut into a pig tumor on a woman's neck, and he severed some of the neck arteries, causing the woman to bleed to death before him.
I also saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who was suffering from difficulty in urination, and the stone was large. He hurried and removed it along with a piece of the bladder wall. The man died about three days later, and I was called upon to remove it. I saw the condition of the stone and the patient's state, which led me to understand what had occurred.
I saw another doctor who earned his living from some pimps in our city by practicing medicine.
A young black boy who had a fracture near his heel along with a wound was brought to this doctor. In his ignorance, the doctor hurriedly set the fracture on top of the wound using bandages and splints very tightly, not leaving any room for the wound to breathe.
Then the doctor left him to his desires and abandoned him for days, telling him not to loosen the bandage. As a result, the boy's leg swelled, and his foot became severely inflamed, bringing him to the brink of death.
I was called to attend to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief from his pain, but the damage had already become severe in the affected part, and I could not prevent it.
The corruption continued to spread in the affected part until he died.
I saw another doctor who lanced a malignant tumor, and after several days, it became ulcerated, worsening the patient's condition. It should be noted that if a cancer is purely black and foul, it should never be cut with a knife at all.
except that it may be in a part that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that work done with the hand is divided into two kinds: work that is accompanied by safety and work that is usually accompanied by damage.
I have warned in every place in this book about the work that involves risk and fear; you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak and criticize, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and for your patients, take gentleness and certainty.
Use the best method leading to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may introduce doubt into your religion and worldly affairs, for it is safer for your dignity and higher in both this world and the next for your destinies.
Galen said in some of his instructions: "Do not treat a bad disease and thereby become bad doctors.
I have divided this article into three sections.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization with fire and sharp medicines, categorized and organized from the head to the foot, including illustrations of instruments, cautery tools, and everything needed for manual work.
The Second Chapter.
On incision, suturing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and the like, all categorized and organized, including illustrations of instruments.
The third chapter.
On bone setting, reduction of dislocations, and the treatment of wounds, categorized and organized from the hand to the foot, with illustrations of instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
And before mentioning how to use it, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in which temperament it should be used.
I say that the discussion about the manner in which cauterization is beneficial and harmful is long, a precise science, and a hidden secret; many philosophers have spoken about it.
They disagreed on this matter, and I have briefly summarized their statements to avoid excessive length.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament that exists with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they disagreed on it. Some say that cauterization is beneficial in this case, while others argue the opposite, claiming that cauterization is not appropriate for a disease caused by heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to heal from a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry treatment. The one who argues the opposite says that cauterization with fire may be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add the moisture of a person's body to the temperament of fire, it results in cooling the person's body.
And I say with him because experience has shown me that many times, but it should not be imagined in such a matter except by one who is experienced and trained in the art of cauterization to a high degree. And he noted the differences in the temperaments of people and the nature of diseases themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold and moist diseases, as all physicians have agreed on their benefit from cauterization and have not differed about it.
Know, O sons, that the secret of treatment by cauterization with fire and its superiority over medicinal cauterization is that fire is a simple substance whose effect does not extend beyond the part being cauterized; it does not harm another connected part except for slight damage.
Cauterization with a medicinal agent may extend its effect to subsequent parts and may even cause a disease in the part that is difficult to treat, or may kill. Fire, due to its nobility and noble essence, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, gained from long service and attention to the craft, and by standing firm on the truths of the matter.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse. Were it not inappropriate for my book, I would have related to you the secret and obscure nature of fire, its manner of action on bodies, and how it cures diseases with philosophical and demonstrative arguments too subtle for your understanding.
Know, my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the springtime to be the best season.
I say that cauterization may be performed at any time, because the harm caused by the season is outweighed by the benefit gained from cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a necessary and strong pain that cannot be delayed, because one fears that it may lead to a greater calamity than the minor harm caused by the season.
And do not think, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease from which there is no return will become a permanent defect.
And it is not as they imagine, for cauterization is like a medicine that alters the bodily temperaments and dries up the humors which are the cause of pain.
However, cauterization is preferable to medication due to the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the power of its influence.
And it is possible for the disease to recur at some point in time depending on the patient's temperament, the severity and strength of the disease, and what accumulates in their body from excesses and neglect in their diet and similar causes.
Except when the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one in an organ with little excess and moisture. Like extracting a tooth for pain and similar procedures, it may be that the pain does not return, and this is usually in the least cases.
And as for the general opinion that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, this statement is correct, not what they themselves believe, because they assume that there is no treatment that helps with medication or otherwise after the occurrence of cauterization, whereas the matter is different from that.
And the meaning of "cauterization is the last resort of medicine" is that whenever we use various methods of treatment for a disease and those medications do not work, then we use cauterization as the final method, which may be effective. This is how it came to be said that cauterization is the last resort of medicine. Not in the meaning that the general public and many ignorant physicians have adopted.
And I mentioned earlier that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence. They also said that the place where the cauterization occurs does not become ulcerated, but this is not an absolute rule.
Because I have tried that and found that it only happens in some bodies but not others. Cauterization with gold is indeed better and preferable to iron as they said, except that when you heat the cauterizing tool from gold in fire, you cannot determine when it has reached the desired temperature by its redness.
And because it cools quickly, and if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in the fire and is poured out, causing the operator to be distracted by this. For this reason, cauterization with iron has become faster and closer to being accurate for work, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, organizing them from the head to the foot so that it is easy for the student to find what he seeks, God willing.
The first chapter.
On cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness in the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent discharges from the head to the area around the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, tooth pain, and throat pains. In general, it is effective for all diseases caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The procedure for this cauterization is to first order the patient to induce vomiting with a purging and cleansing medicine for three nights or four, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their usual condition.
Then order him to shave his head with scissors, and then have him sit before you in a squatting position with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive oil cauterization tool, which has this appearance.
Expose the bone to the size of a chickpea or the size of a mustard seed, and raise your hand; otherwise, return your hand with the same iron tool or another if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I have described to you, then take some salt and dissolve it in water. Soak a piece of cotton in it and place it on the site, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in fat on it and leave it until the inflammation subsides. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that a wound, when left open, prolongs the discharge of pus and is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should remain until part of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then, after that, what has been burned from the bone should be removed, and it should be treated thereafter.
Others say that cauterization should be excessive, affecting the bone strongly, causing pieces to fall from it in the form of a kernel or small crescent. They claim that this allows vapors from the head to dissipate and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it should be treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people, and following this method involves risk; leaving it alone is better in my opinion. May you be safe if that is the case, for the head weakens when its natural connections are severed, as we have seen with other parts of the body.
Especially when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion; I use it, so work with it to ensure safety if God wills.
Chapter Two.
فيكيء الرأس также.
إذا حدث في جمجمة الرأس وجع مزمن وطال ذلك بال病人，并且这种情况持续存在，使用了各种治疗方法如熏蒸、灌洗、药浴和外敷药物，特别是如果已经尝试了一次描述中的烧烙疗法但没有效果的话，那么应当注意。 فلئن كان رأس المريض قوي البنية بطبيعته ولم يكن ضعيفا، ووجد холод شديدا，则应该在上述位置稍上方再烧烙一次。 ثم أكوه على كل قرني رأسه كية حتى يذهب خشونة الجلد وينكشف من العظمquantities as described. Apply cautery at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and be gentle with your hand in this area; do not expose the bone, for the patient will feel intense pain unlike the pain from other cauterizations of the head. I will mention this cautery in its proper place.
The cautery tool used for the sides and back of the head should be gentler than the one used for the center of the head, and this is its appearance.
Chapter Three.
On the cauterization of an acute headache.
If pain and headache occur on one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye, induce vomiting with purgative medicines and use all other treatments mentioned for various diseases. If this does not succeed, cauterization should be performed in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning drug, or with an iron cautery.
As for cauterization with a burning drug, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and trim its ends on both sides. Then make an incision in the affected area of the temple with a wide scalpel until you create a space under the skin that can accommodate the garlic clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then secure it with a bandage tightly. Leave it for approximately fifteen hours, then remove the bandage and extract the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then treat it accordingly.
Cover it with a piece of cotton soaked in fat to promote pus formation, then treat the area with ointment until it heals, if God wills. Alternatively, you can do this with some burning drugs that I mentioned in Article Eighteen on burning medicines.
And as for iron cauterization, it is done in this manner: The cautery iron which has this shape is heated:.
And it is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some indentation and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the affected area and hold it while you rotate the iron slightly, and the depth to which you cauterize should be about half the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below, which would cause bleeding. Then soak a piece of cotton in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then soak the cotton in oil and treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills.
And if you wish, cauterize this abscess with the sharp edge of the cautery tool, and be careful not to cut the artery in this non-chronic abscess especially.
Chapter Four.
On Cauterizing Chronic Abscesses.
If you have treated the abscess with the aforementioned treatments and what was mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment has not been effective, and you see that the condition requires something beyond the initial cauterization with medication or cauterization with fire. You should heat the sharp cautery tool until it turns white. Then, mark a line on the affected area with a length of about half an inch or so, and place the tool once while holding it tight enough to cut through the artery and reach towards the bone.
However, you should be careful not to injure the jaw that moves during chewing, as burning the muscle or nerve that controls it can cause spasms.
Be cautious and wary of the bleeding from the artery you have cut, for there is danger in it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what to do and has not followed a proven method; it would be better to refrain from working.
A discussion on how to manage bleeding from an artery will come in its proper place later in the book, if God wills. If you find a condition that cannot be treated with this cautery method,
And if you see that the patient's body can withstand it, apply a cautery in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, if God wills.
If you wish, you may use the cautery we mentioned in the section on arteriotomy with a double-bladed cautery, as it is a better and more effective method than this one.
Chapter Five.
On the cautery for ear pains.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with purgatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery called "al-nidhat," which has this shape.
Then, after heating it, apply it in droplets around the entire ear as it rotates, or around both ears if the pain is in both. And remove the cauterizing agent from the base of the ear slightly after you have learned the location with ink, and the cauterizing agent should be about ten dots in each ear or thereabouts, then treat the areas until they heal, if God wills.
Chapter Six.
On Cauterizing for Strength.
The condition that is treated with cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
And cauterization should be avoided for the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you have treated this type of condition with diaphoretics, inhalations, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, then the patient should be cauterized with three applications. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization from the opposite side of the affected area because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The procedure for cauterization is to cauterize once opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head, and another at the temple, and its length should be equal to the width of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cauterizing agent until it burns to about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the appearance of the cautery tool, which is a type of knife-like instrument that was previously described but is slightly finer as you can see. It should have a blade that is slightly thicker, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
About chronic abscesses.
If an abscess becomes chronic and your treatment with the methods mentioned is ineffective, and there is no fever in the patient, then cauterize it four times. Cauterize once at each corner of the head, once in the middle of the head as mentioned, and once at the back of the head as previously described.
The cautery should be applied as described. Additionally, cauterize once at the mouth of the stomach, which is more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
About cauterizing for forgetfulness.
Those who suffer from phlegm should be given large doses of expectorants and purgatives for the brain initially.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard plaster to the back of his head as described in the chapter on plasters; do this multiple times, for it is a form of cauterization.
Do this according to the method described there. If he recovers, that is sufficient; otherwise, cauterize him three times at the back of his head, arranged from the top of the head to the base of the neck.
Make the interval between each cauterization the thickness of a finger, then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to increase it and the patient can tolerate this, perform the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase it, cauterize the two horns and then treat him until he is healed. The cautery tool should be olive-shaped as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for hemiplegia and general relaxation of the body.
It is advisable to start with purifying the head using iatrological methods as previously mentioned. Then, shave the patient's head and cauterize it with one cautery in the center of the head, a cautery on each horn of the head, and a cautery at the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If needed for the condition of general relaxation of the body and the patient can tolerate it, with the disease being strong and persistent, cauterize four areas on the vertebrae of his back. Ensure that the cauterization burns most of the skin, then raise your hand and treat him as previously described until he is healed, if God wills it. The cautery tool should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
The patient suffering from epilepsy caused by phlegm should be cauterized. First, it is advisable to purify his brain using large iatrological methods and other treatments mentioned in the division if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medications.
If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use gargles and purified hemostatic agents for several days prior, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and apply one cautery in the middle of the head as previously described, and another cautery at the back of his head. A cautery should be applied to each temple of his head. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from paralysis and relax the body over the cervical vertebrae and spinal vertebrae. The cautery should be olive-green as described previously.
If the patient is a child, then make the cautery gentle as described in this illustration.
Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing Mania.
If the cause of mania is foul humidity and thick phlegm, then apply the cauterizations mentioned for one suffering from paralysis.
If the cause of mania is excess that tends towards black bile and the patient's body is humidified, give him what purifies his brain as described in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight pad of linen in the shape of a circle, and place it on the middle of his head while the patient sits cross-legged holding it firmly from all sides. Then take one pound of old lamb fat.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate warmth, such that a finger can tolerate when inserted. Then pour it into the center of his head in the circle while he keeps holding it firmly, and leave it until it cools down. Do this for the patient once every week along with other proper treatments until he recovers, if God wills.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small dots without holding the cautery in your hand, but let it be a gentle application; for this kind of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in fat or chicken grease to it.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the watery discharge in the eye.
If the beginning of the watery discharge in the eye becomes apparent through the signs mentioned in the classification, then immediately purge the patient to cleanse his head and protect it from all humidity. Sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head. Then cauterize two points on the cheeks if the discharge begins from both eyes or one point if it is from one eye only.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin. Let the cauterizations be as long as the width of the cheeks, and beware of bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it as needed by any means possible. We will come to the wisdom in slitting and cutting arteries while being cautious about bleeding.
He may be cauterized at the back of the head under the two bones with two strong applications.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and constant, and they come from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head externally, and you are certain that this is due to excessive cold phlegm, then use cauterization as I have described at the beginning of the flowing fluid. Cauterize one point in the middle of the head and two points on each cheekbone, and two points at the back of the head under the two bones. If more is needed, cauterize one point on each side near the corner of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On Cauterizing a Putrid Nose.
If the treatment with what we mentioned in the division does not succeed, then immediately treat the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle point with an olive-oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with the spiral cautery iron two points above the eyebrows under the hair slightly, and be careful not to cut the artery. This is a picture of the spiral cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On Cauterizing the Drooping of the Eyelid.
If the eyelid droops due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cautery point using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
If you prefer, cauterize two points above each eyebrow slightly, keeping away from the cheekbones, and the length of each cautery point should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo it with the cauterization; rather, to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned. The shape of the cautery should be like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If her eyelids turn inward, the eye is exposed; cauterization in this case is of two types. Cauterization can be done either with fire or with a burning medicine. As for cauterizing with fire, before doing so, instruct the patient to let their eyelashes grow long and even if they are accustomed to plucking them.
If the eyelid turns inward as the lashes grow, bind his eyes with a bandage so they do not move until it grows. When it has grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
The marking should start near the eyelashes. Then place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white or spurge saliva under the eyelid, then heat the cautery which has this shape.
Then cauterize gradually along the marked shape in many sessions until the surface of the skin, which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned. The sign that your work is successful is when you see the eyelid has lifted and the lashes have raised away from the eyeball.
Then stop and leave it for three days. Then apply a piece of gauze soaked in fat to help remove the scab, then treat with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair regrows or the eyelid becomes loose after some time.
Repeat the cauterization on that place as you did initially. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, pluck it until it returns to its natural position without pricking the eye. As for cauterization with a burning agent, instruct the patient to leave the eyelashes alone until they grow long and straighten.
Then, make a paper figure of an apple leaf. Take one drachm or so each of common soap and unslaked lime, and grind them thoroughly together. Do this in a mortar to prevent drying. Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of an apple leaf and place it on one or both eyelids. Place a piece of cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and have the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger above the medicine and press it slightly while you move it whenever the patient feels a tingling sensation from the medicine, as it will feel like fire. As long as the patient feels this tingling, leave the medicine in place and move it with your finger. Once the tingling subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, and if you see the eyelid rise as it does when cauterized with fire or cut, then do nothing further. If not, apply more of the medicine to the area where it has had no effect and has not darkened until your work is complete and the eye is cauterized. Then place cotton soaked in fat over it until the burn crust falls off.
Then treat it with a cream such as the Nabul or another until it heals. It is essential to be extremely careful during the procedure that no part of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after days and you suspect any hair in the eye, take care.
Prepare the medicine on that part of the eyelid that has relaxed as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of oak leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so adjust accordingly. The way of correctness is not hidden from those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On treating the abscess that occurs in the tear duct.
If the treatment of the abscess, as mentioned in the classifications of diseases, does not succeed, it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold the patient's head still so that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the saliva of a weasel on his eyes, then heat the cautery, which is pictured here.
Make it hollow, shaped like a tube from the horn of an eagle at the end where the cautery will be applied. If you prefer, it can be perforated at the other end, or solid like a reed; however, the hollow type is better for your work, if God wills.
Then squeeze the abscess if it is open and remove the pus, then dry it. If it is not open, cut it open and extract its pus. Then apply the hot cautery to it; hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Move your hand a little farther from the eye toward the nose when cauterizing so that you do not miss or disturb the patient, causing the cautery to fall into the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cautery, stop; otherwise, replace the cautery once more if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage with grease and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it has not healed, then apply a sharp medication that exposes the bone, and proceed as will be mentioned in its section, God willing.
Another approach to cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some early practitioners, is to deliberately cut open the area of the fistula and then place a thin tube in the same incision; this is its illustration.
Pour in an amount equal to the weight of one dirham of melted lead and hold the tube firmly, tightly grasped, and ensure that the patient does not move at all so that the melted lead does not flow into his eye. It is advisable to place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the area of the fistula and heal it miraculously. If the fistula heals as mentioned from cauterization and treatment, then that is sufficient; otherwise, there is no choice but to use nasal puncture and redirect the fistula into the nasal passage, as will be detailed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Cauterizing Cleft Lip.
Often, a cleft in the lip called "the thread" occurs, especially in the lips of children. It often happens that when you treat this cleft with what is mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, heat a small knife-like iron on this manner.
Make the interior as thin as the blade of a knife, then place it hot in the same cleft until the cautery reaches the depth of the cleft, then treat it with the quilting needle until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing the newly occurring fistula in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the base of the palate or in the uvula or at the roots of the teeth, it becomes inflamed and bursts, and from the pus flowing out, a fistula is formed. Then if you treat it and the treatment does not succeed, you should heat an iron cautery to the size that fits into the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula hole and hold it until the heated instrument reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with the treatments mentioned until it heals, if God wills.
If the substance is interrupted and it heals, otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the corrupted bone as will be mentioned in its chapter, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing loose teeth and gums.
If the gums have loosened due to moisture and the teeth have become loose, and you have treated them with medications but they are ineffective, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the iron which its image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Insert the heated iron quickly and hold it for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then repeat inserting the iron as many times as you desire. Then have the patient fill their mouth with saltwater.
Hold it for an hour and then spit it out, for the loose tooth will become stable, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Treating Toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or there are worms in the tooth and medication treatment has not been effective, then cauterizing it can be done in two ways: either by using fat or by using fire.
Cauterizing with fat involves taking beef tallow, then boiling it in an iron ladle or a shell. Take a piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of a rod, then dip it into the boiled tallow and place it quickly on the painful tooth, holding it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold tallow and place it on the painful tooth, then put a heated metal object on top to ensure the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And as for cauterization with fire, it is that you take a copper or iron tube, and let there be some thickness in its bore so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then, heat the cautery which will have its shape depicted and place it on the tooth itself; hold your hand until the cautery cools down, repeat this process several times.
The pain will disappear either that very day or the next. After this cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good oil and hold it for an hour before spitting it out. This is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever part you wish and as much as possible. This is the shape of the tube.

On Cauterizing Pigs.
If the pigs are afflicted with phlegm and cold moistures, and do not yield to maturity through medications, and you wish for rapid maturation, then heat the hollow cautery which has this shape, perforated at both ends.
To allow the smoke to exit from the other end, place it heated on the same tumor once and twice if necessary until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery equal in size to the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton ball soaked in oil until what was burned by the fire is healed, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
في كي الباحة الحنجرية من ناحية انسداد الصوت وضيق النفس.
إذا غلبت الرطوبات على قصبة الرئة ولا سيما إذا كان ذلك مع برودة المزاج، فينبغي أن يستفرغ العليل أولاً بالأدوية المسهلة، ثم تكويه كيّة في نقرة النحر عند أصل الحلقوم في الموضع المنخفض.
فاحذر أن تصل بالكي إلى الحلقوم ولا تحرق من الجلد إلا نصفة، ثم اكوه كيّة أخرى عند مفصل العنق في آخر خرزة منه بليغة، وتكون المكواة مسمارية على الصفة التي تقدمت.
ثم عالجه بما تقدم ذكره حتى يبرأ إن شاء الله.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
في كي مر병 الرئة والسعال.
إذا كان السعال ومرض الرئة عن رطوبات باردة ولم يكن بالعليل حمى ولا سل وكان المرض مزمنا فاكوه كيّتين فوق الترقوتين في المواضع المنخفضة اللينة الفارغة، وكيّة أخرى في وسط الصدر بين الثديين.
وتكون المكواة مسمارية على الصورة التي تقدمت، وإن شئت فليك كيّك تنقيطاً بالمكواة التي تسمى النقطة وقد تقدمت صورتها في تنقيط وجع الأذنين، وتكون النقط من ثلاثين نقطة إلى نحوها.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until he is healed, and you may make an iron with three prongs in this shape, for you can cauterize three areas at once with it. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Cauterizing the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moistures or does not stabilize when it is reduced after dislocation until it becomes habitual, reducing it and then dislocating it again with the slightest movement, as we have observed, it is necessary to reduce the elbow first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his right side, then raise the skin inside the armpit upwards with your left fingers if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the iron with two prongs, which is shaped as follows.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, forming four cauterizations. It can also be cauterized with an iron that has three prongs, in which case six cauterizations will form, and the prongs should be placed on the thin part of the fold.
And this is the image of the iron with three prongs.
It can also be increased by one more cauterization, making the cauterizations eight in total. Then apply boiled wheat with salt to cover the cauterized area, and the patient must remain still without moving the limb for a time until it strengthens. If the dislocation is upward, this is rare.
Make one good peg-shaped cauterization above the shoulder or many dotted cauterizations, for the joint will strengthen, moisture will be removed, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Cauterizing the Stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, causing it to deviate from its normal temperament and leading to an increase in downward discharges, and if various treatments have been ineffective, the patient should lie on his back with arms and legs extended, and then three cauterizations should be applied. Apply one peg-shaped cauterization directly below the chest spoon by the width of a finger, and two more cauterizations beneath each side of the first cauterization to form a triangular shape, keeping them apart so they do not join if they suppurate. The depth of the cauterization should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, without excess.
If you prefer, apply one large cauterization in the center of the stomach in this manner.
The cautery used for this single cauterization should be circular in this manner.
The stomach may be cauterized with dotted cauterizations for those who are afraid of this single cauterization. This involves applying dots as needed with the cauterizing agent, then cauterizing it with a dotted cautery, followed by treatment as previously described until recovery occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
Regarding the cold biliary temperament.
If pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and moisture, or due to a noxious vapor, such that it deviates from its natural temperament excessively, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification but finds no relief. The patient should lie on his stomach, and three applications of cauterization with a hot iron should be performed in this manner and of exactly this size on the liver, below the ribs where a person's elbow would reach.
Each cauterization should be one finger-width apart from the next, and the cauterization should run straight along the length of the body. Do not hold the cautery tool too tightly.
The amount of skin burned should be half its thickness, no more. The patient should stand on both feet; if not possible, he should lie down with his legs outstretched and arms raised. This is the image of the cautery tool.
You may perform these cauterizations with a knife-shaped cautery if you have skill and caution, so as not to overdo the burning and burn through the skin entirely, which could damage the abdomen and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Regarding the treatment of swelling and tumors in the liver with cauterization.
If there is an abscess in the liver and you wish to determine whether the swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will experience a heavy pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the vicinity of the liver, there is an extremely sharp pain, and I have observed that its treatment has exhausted the skills of physicians. Therefore, the patient should lie on his back, then apply a poultice to the warm area.
Then heat the iron in the fire; it is the iron that resembles a mil (likely referring to a tool or instrument), and this is its image. Scorch it with one cautery until the skin is completely burned, and continue the cauterization to reach the serous membrane until all of the diseased matter is expelled. Then treat it as you would a abscess until it heals.
This type of cauterization should not be used except by someone who has extensive experience in the practice of medicine and has repeatedly treated these diseases through experimentation. Only then should they proceed with such a procedure, as I believe it is better to leave it unattended.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Appendicitis.
I mentioned earlier the cauterization of cold appendicitis using the root of the zaraund in this manner: Take one dry, long root of the zaraund that you can find and make it as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then cauterize it with one cautery between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries slightly below the jugular veins on the side under the chin, and two large cauteries above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly tilted backward, another in the center of the chest, and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind one between the shoulders, and two on either side of the spine below the cautery that is between the shoulders.
You should not deepen your hand during cauterization but rather do it on the surface of the skin for ventilation. Some early scholars mentioned that there are people who used an iron cautery similar to a needle, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
And it removes the tumor as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors. Cauterizing this area is very risky; either the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may form in the area that cannot be cured.
Chapter Thirty.
On Cauterizing the Spleen.
If you treat a spleen disease with the treatments mentioned in the division and they are ineffective, then cauterize it on three aspects, all of which are correct. One method is to cauterize it with three or four cauteries arranged along the length of the spleen.
In the form of the cauteries of the liver, which have been previously described. The distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger or slightly more. The shape of the cautery should be as mentioned for cauterizing the liver. Do not deepen your hand during cauterization, and the patient should lie on his back.
The other method is at the armpit. Lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and raise the skin across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the cautery rods very carefully until they exit through the other side of the skin. Then remove the cautery and make four cauterizations, or if you wish, use the other cautery with three rods.
Then treat the cauterized area after leaving it to drain pus for many days, as this is more effective than other previously mentioned treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Cauterizing Dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial for intestinal dropsy in particular. If you have treated the patient with various treatments mentioned in the classification and none of them were effective, then you should cauterize four spots around the navel and one spot on the abdomen.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind his back between the shoulder blades, one opposite his chest and another opposite his abdomen. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the cauterized area open to drain pus for a long period of time.
Do not discontinue treatment after cauterization without what is necessary for it to gather both effects, thus hastening recovery. The shape of the cautery used for the back should be spiral as previously described, and the one used for the abdomen should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On Cauterizing the Feet and Legs.
If they become swollen in the edematous area and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the notch between the little toe and the ring toe.
And hold your hand with the cautery and do not turn it, then raise your hand and do not repeat it at all, for the yellow water will drain. The cautery should be in this form.
Then cauterize on each leg with two cauteries; use the sharp tip of the cautery and apply it along the length of the leg, one above the knee and another below it near the middle of the leg. On each thigh, perform two cauteries.
Leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time until water drains from it, then treat it with all that has been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterizing Diarrhea.
If diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, weakening the forces that hold and digest in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various methods but has not improved, and if you see the patient capable of enduring cauterization and full of strength, cauterize him with a large cautery on his abdomen. As mentioned in the cauterization of the abdomen with a circular cautery and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with a fine spiral cautery, apply one large or two cauterizations on the buttocks above the coccyx.
If you see that the moisture is abundant and the patient can endure it, cauterize him with one cautery on each groin and one cautery on each flank. You may also add two small cauterizations near the large one on the abdomen. This treatment is effective and its benefit is not mistaken, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Regarding hemorrhoids of the rectum.
If there are chronic, numerous hemorrhoids in the rectum or a single one that is of thick, cold, or corrupt humors, and if treatment as mentioned in the classification has not been effective, then apply three cauterizations on the lower part of the spine beneath the buttocks slightly, forming a triangle.
Cauterize a spot two fingerbreadths below the navel. If you determine that his stomach has become cold and that food is not digesting, and if you notice his face swelling, cauterize a large spot on the stomach as previously described, and also cauterize his liver. Cauterize his spleen with a spiral cautery and leave the cauterization open for some time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
Regarding the cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if the wart has been cut, heat the cautery that resembles a needle and then insert it while hot into the cut wart. Proceed until the cautery reaches the mouth of the sweat gland from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If you cauterize it with a larger cautery on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
Regarding the treatment of fistulas in the buttocks and surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to incision and the procedure we have described and is reluctant to undergo it, he may recover through cauterization. If pus and foul moisture flow from one of the fistulas that has become chronic, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth with the probe. Heat the cautery tool that resembles a melon and insert it, heated, into the same fistula along the depth measured by the probe. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupted substances are burned, once or twice or three times as needed.
Be cautious not to burn any nerve if there is one, or a major vein. If the fistula leads to the bladder or intestines, be especially careful.
Be cautious of all these areas. You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you determine that it is not permeable. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals off, stops discharging matter, and remains so for some time, then know that it has healed completely.
If the area continues to discharge matter, then know that it is permeable or that there is a corrupted bone deep within it, or something similar which will be mentioned later in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
Regarding the cauterization of the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or strong wind and there is a decrease in the patient's vitality, it is advisable to cauterize on the back over each kidney using the spiral cautery previously mentioned. It may be cauterized a third time on the same day, resulting in three arranged cauterizations, which will be more effective for treatment.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, to the point that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize once below the navel over the bladder where pubic hair begins, a second time to the right of the navel, and a third time to the left.
And after cauterization on each side, it should be done to the extent of the width of a thumb joint. Cauterize once at the base of the spine or twice if necessary. The cautery should be spiral as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Cauterizing the Uterus.
If a substance forms in the uterus due to cold and moisture, preventing pregnancy and causing infertility or if pain occurs during menstruation, it is advisable to cauterize three times around the navel as described for cauterizing the bladder. And cauterize once on the cotton at the base of the spine or twice, and the cautery should be spiral.
Chapter Forty.
How to Dislocate the Hip.
Incorrect humoral conditions can lead to the displacement of the hip, and a sign of this is that one leg becomes longer than the other when compared. You will find an empty space where the dislocation has occurred, and it is necessary to cauterize the patient at the site of the hip itself with a semi-circular cautery.
After marking around the hip joint as it rotates so that the hip itself falls in the center of the circle, if you do not have the specific cautery previously described for cauterizing the stomach, then cauterize three times with a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cautery deep according to the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-One.
How to Cauterize for Sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and the cause is cold and excessive moisture, and treating the patient with the methods mentioned in the classification has not been effective after some time, it is necessary to ease the patient's humors with foul-smelling seeds or prickly seeds and similar substances.
Then cauterize the patient, and there are two ways to do this: either with medicinal caustics or with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in various ways; one method is to cauterize at the site of the hip joint itself three triangular cauteries in this manner.
It should have a suitable depth, and the distance between each burn mark should be equal to the thickness of a finger. The cautery should be olive-shaped. Sometimes one burn mark is made in the middle on the hip itself, so there are four burn marks in total. If you wish, you can make one burn mark using the circular method previously mentioned for dislocating the hip.
The circle should enclose the entire hip and burn through the whole thickness of the skin. This is the description of the burning for sciatica if the pain is localized to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, burn two areas on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates the pain. One burn should be above the calf, four fingers away towards the outer side slightly. The cautery should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards his toes, burn three, four, or more points where he indicates, using a dot-shaped cautery. If he indicates the pain below the knee toward the leg, burn one point there with a knife-shaped cautery.
Be cautious in all burns to avoid burning a nerve or major artery, as this could cause a serious harm or long-term illness to the patient.
I have seen one case and a second where someone was cauterized above the calf, and the burning was excessive. As a result, the leg became gangrenous up to the foot, it completely rotted, and the entire limb was ruined. Diarrhea and death followed thereafter. If the pain is in both sides, burn them in the same manner described.
Some scholars among the philosophers mentioned in the text for hip cautery: This cautery is made like a cup of iron, and its diameter is half a handbreadth; at its mouth it is as thick as an olive pit or slightly less, and inside this cup there is another cup and a third one.
And the space between each pair of cups is as wide as a thumb joint, and the cups are open on both sides; their height is about one or two thumb joints. A handle made of iron is firmly attached to them, and this is its shape.
Then heat it in the fire until it turns red and throw off the sparks, then place it on the affected hip while the patient lies on their healthy side. Apply three circular cauterizations at once, then leave it for three days. Dress it with grease and keep the wound open for several days.
Treat it with ointment until he recovers. The author of this book says: This type of cautery is rarely used due to its severity and frightening appearance, but those who can endure it find it effective when applied to the proper area.
As for cautery with burning medicines, it is made by creating two cups resembling the sockets into which door hinges are inserted, made of copper or iron.
The height around each of them is about two thumb joints or thereabouts, and the distance between them is as thick as a finger. They are open at both top and bottom, and some parts are joined together in this manner.
Then place them on the affected hip while the patient lies on their healthy side. Keep your hand soft and pour a little warm water, heated by fire, between the two circles. Hold it for about one hour as measured by an hourglass. The patient must endure the sting and burning sensation, for they will feel a pain like that of fire.
Until the pain subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water off the entire hip with fresh water. Then leave it for three days and apply fat until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for several days for pus to drain, as this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it as you did for the hip to keep water out. This is the nature of sharp water, which I have established in an article on preparing medicines.
Take one part each of frying salt and unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, proportionate to how much can be poured out by a ladle. Place another glazed pot beneath the first pot's base.
Pour fresh water over the salt and lime to cover them by one finger, after squeezing them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drains into the glazed pot at the bottom. Then collect all this water and pour it onto new lime and salt that are also renewed.
It will then be very sharp and effective for many medical tasks and for cauterizing other parts, as it acts like fire itself. There are also medicines used for cauterizing the hip, such as thapsia, bladder stone honey, and lime with soap, which are boiled.
Galen tells a story about an ancient man who had a remedy for hip pain and sciatica, and he highly praised it, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it heals in one application.
Until he is carried into the bathhouse and comes out cured, which is done by taking green cumin if available; otherwise, dry new cumin is used. It should be ground with some fat and applied to the affected area in the hip, thigh, or leg.
It should be tightened and left for three hours or until the patient feels that the burning has subsided. Then carry him into the bathhouse, and when his body is moist with sweat, bring him to the basin, for the pain will subside and he will be cured, if it be God's will. If he does not recover, redress the bandage on him again after ten days.
He will be cured, if it be God's will. Note that one should not use cauterization with these medicines until the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that the sweat of a goat, when used for cauterization on lumbago, is beneficial.
Cauterization should be performed in this manner: Take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it on the deep spot between the thumb and the wrist, closer to the wrist. Then take dry sweat from a goat.
Set it alight with fire until it becomes a glowing ember, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one; continue doing this until the sensation reaches midway between the shoulder and the hip, and the pain will subside, if it be God's will. This type of cauterization is called goat sweat cauterization.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Cauterization for Back Pain.
Pain in the back may arise from many causes, such as a fall or blow or excessive vomiting and similar conditions. It results from an outpouring of cold and moist matter, and cautery is applied only to this type alone.
When the cause is an outpouring of cold matter, it is necessary, after making the patient vomit with foul-smelling pills and similar substances, to cauterize his back where the pain is located in three rows at the width of a table's breadth. Mark the spots with bloodletting first, then apply five or more cauterizations per row as you see fit according to the patient’s tolerance and strength.
Cauterization should be done with a spot iron. If you prefer, you can cauterize it three or four times with a medium-sized nail iron in this manner.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterizing the Initial Stage of Kyphosis.
This condition often affects young children, and its initial sign in a child is difficulty breathing when standing or moving. You will find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a protruding bone that stands out from the rest of the vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to prevent its progression, cauterize it with a circular iron in this manner. Apply the cauterization evenly on all sides of the vertebra. If you prefer, you can cauterize around the vertebra with a spot iron in two or three rows, with the spots close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as mentioned.
Be careful not to use cauterization on a hunchback that is caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-four.
On cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If the joint pains are due to cold dampness that settles in any part of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, it is particularly called gout by physicians.
If cold gout is treated with various treatments mentioned in the classification and the pain does not subside, then cauterization can alleviate it. This involves cauterizing around the knee joints multiple times after vomiting, using a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery as shown in this figure.
If it is necessary to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a puncture cautery. If the pain rises to the knees or other joints, which often occurs, then cauterize each knee with three or four applications from each side using this same olive-shaped cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, proceed with caution and do not go too deep; it should be no deeper than the thickness of the skin. If the pain rises to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in that section.
If the pain is only in the hands, puncture around the wrists in two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, puncture each joint once and at the base of the hand. If the pain rises to the elbows or shoulders after days, proceed accordingly.
Deal with them from all sides, and do not leave the patient without proper care and medication. For if he improves his diet and expels phlegm, then he will recover along with this cautery, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Cauterizing Abscesses.
If an inguinal hernia appears and part of the intestine or mesentery descends to the testicle, and if this is recent and mild, you should order the patient to fast for a day and use laxatives to expel the feces from the intestines.
Then lie him down before you on his back and instruct him to hold himself still until the mesentery or intestine protrudes, then push it back with your finger. Then mark with ink under the hernia on the pubic bone a semicircular shape with its ends toward the upper part of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws sparks. Then push the intestine or mesentery back into the abdomen. Then have a servant place his hand on the area to prevent the intestines from protruding again. Spread the patient's legs apart and place a pillow under him, and another servant to secure his legs.
And another servant on his chest to restrain his hands. Then place the cautery on the mark and press it down straight and firmly until it reaches the bone, or return it once if it does not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Guard your effort from the protrusion of flesh while cauterizing, lest you burn it and cause either death or great harm to the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And it is necessary for the cautery used on children to be delicate according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then, three days after cauterization, treat the area with fat until the redness of the burn subsides. Then continue to treat it with other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is fully closed.
It is necessary to make his diet during the treatment period such that it softens his stomach, so that the intestines do not protrude during straining or defecation. Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, use a firm bandage and keep him bound for another forty days, while reducing his exertion and intake of food and drink, as well as avoiding loud shouting.
If this treatment is followed properly, he will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and is new, if you wish to prevent it from worsening, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery according to its size. Make sure to cauterize one-third of the skin and then treat it as mentioned. It will not worsen, God willing. Some early practitioners have suggested using a triangular cautery on this pattern for hernias.
After treating the hernia with medicine, draw a line across at the top of the hernia and another line downwards. Place your hand in the middle and use one cautery, nail-shaped, and the first method is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the Pith of the Thymus.
If pain occurs in some organs due to a fall or a blow, and the pain persists for a long time without being relieved by medication, it is advisable to cauterize them with a cautery. The cauterization of each organ should be according to its size, whether large or small, as well as its strength or weakness.
If the pain and swelling persist, he will recover from the first cauterization; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on him because it is characteristic of such pains to transfer from one organ to nearby ones. Therefore, follow them with cauterizations until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On Cauterizing Leprosy.
Those suffering from leprosy may greatly benefit from cauterization, especially those with a type of leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize them, observe if the leprosy is in its initial stage and treat it as mentioned in the classification. If it does not subside and continues to progress, and you fear that corruption may take hold of the patient's entire constitution, then cauterize the head with five applications. The first one in the middle of the head, as is customary; the second one below it near the forehead at the end of the hair; two on the temples; and one at the back on the occipital bone. Apply the cauterization slightly deeper so that it affects the bone to some extent.
And the scabs are removed to facilitate the escape of thick vapors, and it is also cauterized on the same part of the spleen as mentioned before. As for leprosy that persists in the patient and becomes clearly visible, it should be cauterized with these cauteries mentioned for the head. Cauterization on the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large cauterization at the coccyx near the tailbone, and another above it in the same area, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on each knee, one on each knee, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterization at every joint of his fingers and toes, one on each heel, and one on each wrist.
Be careful of the nerve at the back of the heels to avoid burning them. A cautery can be applied on the pubic bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Note that the more you increase the cauterizations, the more effective they become.
Know that the patient does not feel pain from cauterization as a healthy person would because his body is numb. The cauteries should be made with large or small instruments according to the organs and joints, as described earlier for the characteristics of the tools.
Then treat the cauterization with flour of zinc mixed with honey and continue the treatment until he is healed, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
When a part of the body becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then cut away the numb tissue according to whether the bone within the affected member is large or small. Make your incision slightly deeper into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. For some numbness that affects the hand or foot, you may cauterize the vertebrae in the back where the nerve exits that controls that part, and the numbness will disappear.
This should only be done by one who is well-versed in the anatomy of the body and the origins of the nerves that control its movements.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Cauterizing Vitiligo.
If vitiligo persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a shallow incision according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with flour of lentils mixed with rose oil, rue leaves, and the blood of a dove or a partridge, using an equal part of each. Mix all ingredients together and apply to a bandage which should be applied to the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cauterizing Cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop its progression, cauterize it with a circular iron around its perimeter. Some wise men have suggested making a deep incision in its center, but I do not recommend this because I expect it to ulcerate, as I have witnessed this happening several times.
It is correct to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cauterizing the Dilated Part.
If a dilated part occurs and it delays in maturing, either due to the potency of the cause that led to its formation or due to the age of the patient if they are old with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the dilated part, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, like dots.
Then leave it, for it will mature more quickly. If you wish to treat it with cauterization, heat the cautery tool which has this shape.
Place it in the center of the dilated part until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from below to facilitate the flow of pus, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On Cauterizing Ulcers.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads through the organ, eating it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place where cauterization with fire is possible, heat many cautery tools of various sizes—both small and large—as appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all the corruption is completely removed and nothing remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs and corruption are completely removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If you see after three days that the flesh is growing properly without any corruption, do nothing else; but if there is still decay, recauterize the remaining diseased areas, and treat the ulcer with a sharp medicine.
For it acts as fire more quickly. I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp medicine in the classification; take it from there whenever you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing reversed and non-reversed nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet; it is rough and causes pain. Cauterization for this condition can be done in two ways: either by fire or by sharp water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is done by heating a concave iron tool resembling an eagle's feather, which is made of iron and fits around the nail on all sides, with its edge being thin. Then place the heated tool onto the nail and rotate your hand around the nail with the tool until the tool reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days until pus forms, then dress it with crushed wild barley mixed with salt. Keep the dressing on overnight; the nail will then come off from its root. Treat the wound site with an ointment that promotes flesh growth until it heals. If the nails are not reversed,
This condition often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly in the hands and feet. You should take a tube made of copper or iron, or an eagle's feather, and place it over the nail or growth. Then pour a small amount of sharp water into the tube.
Hold your hand and turn it slightly, so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and let the sharp water find its way to sink to the root of the nail. The patient should bear the pricking of the sharp water for a little while.
Then leave it, for the nail will come off with its root. Do this one by one until you have dealt with all of them in the body, then treat the areas after they are removed using ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On Scalding the Sponge.
If one of the attendants is affected by cold in the nerve or feverishness or other ailments, it is necessary to scorch him four or five times on the spine between each vertebra once, and once on his chest. And scorch his stomach with an oily iron, for the attendant will be relieved and the cold disease will quickly mature.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Scorching Sudden Pustules in the Body.
Pustules may appear in the body due to thick, corrupt cold substances. When they first appear, it is necessary to scorch each pustule lightly at its head with a lit end of an ash stick or the base of a long candle or with a lentil-shaped iron.
Veins may also be scathed at their initial appearance in this manner, so that it does not worsen and the causative factor causing them dissipates, leading to the patient's recovery. However, it should be done after letting blood from the patient.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
في كيّ النزف الحادث عند قطع الشريان.
كثيرًا ما يحدث نزف الدم من شريان قد انقطع عند جرح يظهر من الخارج أو عند شق ورم أو كيّ عضو ونحو ذلك، فيعسر إيقافه.
فإذا حدث لأحد ذلك فاسرع بيدك إلى فم الشريان فضع عليه إصبعك السبابة وشدّه نعما حتى يحصر الدم تحت إصبعك ولا يخرج منه شيء ثمّ تضع في النار مكاوى زيتونيّة صغارا وكبارا عددا وتنفح عليها حتى تصير حامية جدًا.
ثم تأخذ منها واحدة إما صغيرة وإما كبيرة على حسب الجرح والموضع الذي انفتق فيه الشريان وتنزل المكواة على نفس العرق بعد أن تنزع إصبعك بالعجلة وتمسك المكواة حتى ينقطع الدم.
فإن اندفع عند رفعك الإصبع من فم الشريان وطفأ المكواة فخذ مكواة أخرى بالعجلة من المكاوى التي في النار المعدة ولا تزال تفعل ذلك بواحدة بعد أخرى حتى ينقطع الدم.
وتحفظ لا تحرق عصبا يكون هناك فتحدث على العليل بلية أخرى، واعلم أن الشريان إذا نزف منه الدم فإنّه لا يستطاع قطعه ولا سيما إذا كان الشريان عظيما إلا بأحد أربعة أوجه إما بالكى كما قلنا وإما ببتره إذا لم يكن قد انبتر. For when it is amputated, its ends contract and the blood flow stops; either it is tied tightly with threads, or medicines that stop the bleeding are applied and bandages are securely applied.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a ligature or by pressing with cloth or applying burning substances and the like, it does not stop the bleeding in this way at all, except rarely. If any of that happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine available, he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound as we have described.
It should be pressed very tightly until the blood constricts and stops flowing from above the wound and on the artery. The finger should not be removed by cold water continuously until the blood coagulates, thickens, and stops. During this time, observe what is needed for cauterizing or treating with medicine.
The Second Chapter.
On Incisions, Lancing, Bloodletting, and Wounds and the Like.
Khallaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease that can be treated with cauterization by fire and burning medicines, along with their causes and reasons, instruments, and forms of cautery. We arranged this according to sections from the toe to the knee.
And I will follow the same approach in this chapter so that it is easy for the student to achieve what is desired.
Before beginning, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more precious and valuable information than what is in the first chapter regarding cauterization.
Therefore, it is necessary that the warning be stronger because the work in this field often involves vomiting up blood, which sustains life, when opening a vein or incising a tumor or abscess or treating a wound or removing an arrow or incising for a stone and similar procedures, all of which involve risk and fear and often result in death.
I warn you against falling into what is doubtful. Indeed, various types of people may come to you in this craft with different kinds of illnesses; some are weary from their illness and find death easy upon them.
Due to the severity of his illness and the length of his suffering, there are signs from his disease that indicate death. There are also those who offer you money in hope of recovery, but their illness is fatal; therefore, it should not be acceptable for you to assist someone coming to you with this kind of situation at all.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of these actions unless you have certain knowledge about the desirable outcome. Use the advance of knowledge and warning about what leads to safety in all treatments for your patients.
For in that you will find assistance in acquiring praise, glory, remembrance, and gratitude. May God grant you wisdom, O my children, and do not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
I have organized this chapter into sections from the heel to the head, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, to make it easier for you to find what you seek, if God wills.
The first chapter.
في علاج الماء الذي يجتمع في رؤوس الصبيان.
إن هذا السقم كثيرا ما يعرض للصبيان عند الولادة إذا ضغطت القابلة رأس الصبي بغير رفق، و قد يعرض أيضا من علة خفية لا تعرف.
ولم أر هذه العلة في غير الصبيان، وجميع من رأيت منهم أسرع إليه الموت، فلذلك رأيت ترك العمل به. ولقد رأيت منهم صبيا قد امتلأ رأسه ماء والرأس يعظم في كل يوم. حتى لم يطق الصبي يقعد على نفسه لعظم رأسه، والرطوبة تتزايد حتى هلك.
وهذا الرطوبة إما أن تجتمع بين الجلد والعظم، وإما أن تجتمع تحت العظم على الصفاق. والعمل في ذلك إن كانت الرطوبة فيما بين الجلد والعظم وكان الورم صغيرا، ينبغي أن تشق في وسط الرأس شقًا واحدا بالعرض، ويكون طول الشق نحو عقدين حتى تسيل الرطوبة. وهذه صورة المبضع.
فإن كانت الرطوبة أكثر والورم أعظم، فاجعلها شقين متقاطعين على هذه الصورة:.
وإن كانت الرطوبة تحت العظم، وعلامتها أن ترى خياطات الرأس مفتوحة من كل جهة، والماء ينخفض إذا عصرته بيديك إلى داخل، وليس بخفى ذلك عليك، فينبغي أن تشق في وسط الرأس ثلاثة شقوق على هذه الصورة.
After the incision, all the moisture is removed, then the cuts are bandaged and treated with dressings. Then it is covered from above with drink and oil until the fifth day, then the ligature is loosened and the wound is treated with bandages and ointments, and do not neglect to gently bind the head, and feed the patient with all dry food that has little moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and the collection of fluid appear, for it may be more in the back of the head or in the front, or on the right or on the left.
You should aim the incision where the swelling and fluid accumulation are apparent, so cut as you can, but be cautious not to cut an artery, for this would cause bleeding and the patient might die from that bleeding while trying to expel the moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the temporal arteries.
When someone suffers a severe onset affecting the eyes or chest, and if that condition persists despite treatment with medicines and no improvement is seen, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you intend to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a coarse cloth to make the artery visible. Then secure the patient’s neck with the edge of their garment. Look for where the pulse beats; their locations are the two slightly depressed areas behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then apply ink to them and cut them with a sharp knife down to the bone, and this should be as wide as the head. If you prefer, insert the knife under the artery and cut it upwards, and the length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the vein is cut, the blood will flow in a pulsating manner, advancing forward repeatedly. If the artery does not appear to the senses, you should measure three fingers' length from the ear and then apply ink and cut down to the bone; what is essential is that.
Send blood for six watches at intervals, but you may take more or less depending on what appears to you regarding the patient's strength and fullness of their arteries. Then look at the wound; if there is any mesentery left on the bone, cut it away.
To prevent inflammation, then bind the wound with a thread from cotton cloth, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
The Third Chapter.
On cutting the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headaches or acute attacks caused by acrid and hot rheumatics, heat in the temples' muscles, severe chronic migraines, or similar conditions, and treatments prescribed by medicine have not been effective, we have found that cutting or cauterizing the arteries in the temples, as described, can be tried for these diseases.
The method of cutting them involves shaving the hair from the temples of the patient, and then identifying the visible artery in the temple. Its pulse will be evident to you, and it is rarely hidden except in some individuals.
And when it is very cold, if the artery is not visible to you, have the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then rub the area yourself with a cloth or wrap the area in hot water until the artery becomes clearly and distinctly visible. Then take the scalpel whose image is shown here. Then gently peel the skin with it until you reach the artery, then attach a probe to it and pull it up until you remove it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, loop one end of the probe around it. Then cut a portion of it as much as its ends are apart and it contracts without causing bleeding, for if it is not amputated and severed, the blood will not actually stop. Then let out six to three measures of blood.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread, which may be either silk or horsehair, so that putrefaction does not reach it before the wound heals and causes bleeding.
Then cut off the excess between the ties. You can do this at that time or later. If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife-like cautery until its ends are severed, which serves as an equivalent or even better procedure as we have said.
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization helps to eliminate moisture and is more beneficial. After peeling the arteries, fill the area with old cotton and place secure bandages on it. After healing, treat with drying medicines and plasters until he recovers, if God wills.
If bleeding occurs from an artery during your work, proceed to cut it either by cauterization or fill the area with a plug and tighten your hand until the blood stops. If neither of these is available to you, place your finger on it until the blood clots.
Cool the area with very cold water until the severity subsides and then bandage it properly. A simpler method than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this two-bladed cautery after applying medicated dressings to the areas.
Heat it very intensely until it reaches the bone and the vein is divided into two places so that there is some distance between its ends, as it will not heal with this cauterization at all. This is a picture of the cautery.
The blades are sharp, resembling two small handles, though they are much less sharp than a knife because if they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly and the flesh would not be severed rapidly. If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will hold onto them.
Cut the flesh quickly, and this procedure is better than any other method, lighter, and easier. The space between the two blades should be as thick as a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the Treatment of Continuous Hot Tears Flowing to the Eyes.
If the tears are continuous and their flow is from the veins on the outer skull, and no benefit is derived from medical treatments with medications, and you see that the patient's face has become red. There is a sensation on his forehead like the movement of ants, and his eyes are sunken and watery; their eyelashes have worn away due to excessive tears. Therefore, the initial treatment for this condition involves this procedure, which they call treatment with the sword, that is, ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made in the forehead along its length. Each incision is about two finger-widths long; one is parallel to the length of the nose and in the middle of the forehead, the second is slightly closer to the muscle movement at the temple on one side, and the third is similarly placed on the opposite side.
Be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from where the jaws are connected. The distance between each incision should be about three finger-widths. Have pieces of sponge prepared or a dry cloth at hand to staunch the blood.
Then insert the sharp-ended scalpel, which has this shape. Insert the scalpel from the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it peel off all the skin between the incisions along with the subcutaneous tissue on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove the scalpel. Insert another instrument called a sharp knife on one side and smooth on the other into the first incision, as shown in this image.
Place the sharp side of the instrument upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin and the smooth side towards the bone, then push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without penetrating the outer layer of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the places from solidified clotted blood, then place a wick made of cotton wool in each incision and put on it a dressing soaked with syrup and oil or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling, and on the third day loosen the bandage and use much lint with warm water, then treat it with a salve of basilicon with rose oil, and all that is used to treat wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone has severe, hot, continuous discharges to the eyes, and you see the eyes are weak and small, their vision is weakened, the eyelids are ulcerated, and the eyelashes are falling out. There will be a sharp, painful pain deep in the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, understand that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is to order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
There will be a sharp, painful pain deep in the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, understand that those substances and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is to order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or make it a bit higher across the forehead, and start the incision from the left temple to the right temple. The incision should reach the bone, and keep your hand away from the moving muscles of the temples when chewing. Once the bone is exposed, clean all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton wool or a bandage of linen, and bind it from above with dressings soaked in syrup and oil to prevent a hot swelling. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scratch the bone until new flesh begins to grow.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them, which is used for tissue regeneration in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of objects that fall into the ear.
All objects that fall into the ear are one of four types: either a metallic stone or something like a stone such as iron or glass; or plant seeds like chickpeas, nuts, and the like; or a liquid substance such as water, vinegar, and the like.
Or it may be an animal. When a stone or something like a stone falls into the ear and does not move within it, turn the affected ear towards the sun. If you see the stone, drop a little violet oil or olive oil onto it, then try to remove it by moving your head or sneezing. Plug the nostrils when you sneeze, after placing a band of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upward. Often, this treatment will cause it to come out; if not, then try to remove it with thin pitch, which looks like this.
If it comes out with the pitch, otherwise try to remove it with a thin, flexible hook. If that does not work, make a tube of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole gently.
Surround the tube with softened cork greased to prevent air from taking another route, then pull it strongly with your breath; often this will cause it to come out. If it does not come out as described, take some Nabataean gum or prepared birdlime in small amounts and place it at the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly in cotton, then gently insert it into the dry ear canal. If it does not come out with what was described, proceed to make an incision before a hot swelling occurs or it becomes constricted.
The incision procedure begins by letting blood from the patient in a cup, according to their strength. Then sit the patient between your hands, turn their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its fleshy part in the lower position.
The incision should be in a crescent shape until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instrument is available. Then quickly suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that swell and become inflamed, try to remove it using the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, take a thin, delicate scalpel in this form.
Try to cut that type of seed fallen in the ear with it. Do this only if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear, making it easier to break into small pieces. Then remove them with forceps, a thin probe, or suction.
As mentioned, it becomes easier to remove them. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first try to sneeze with cundue; while lying on the side of the affected ear, stuff some old cotton in the ear if necessary. If this method works, the water will come out.
And if not, take many thin smooth stones along the fingers and warm them slightly by fire, then insert one into the patient's ear hole, and move it with a stone from that side, and strike another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
He should continue doing this with one stone after another until all the water is removed. Alternatively, the water can be removed by taking a piece of linen or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and holding the other end over fire until it burns up most of it, then repeating with another piece.
Do this repeatedly until all the water is removed, or pull it out with a tube as previously described for stones. As for removing an animal that has entered, observe: if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as mentioned in the division and proceed accordingly.
If its body is large and visible, try to remove it with oil and tweezers; this method is easier than dealing with anything that might occur in the ear. As for removing worms that have grown in the ear, if you treat it as mentioned in the division concerning suppurations and your treatment does not succeed,
You should examine the ear in sunlight; if you see any worms, remove them with oil or fine tweezers. If nothing appears, use a tube like this one.
The tube is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as previously described for stones.
If it does not come out as mentioned, use the cataplasms that I have described, which the ancients used to kill worms. You will find this in the article on cataplasms. And you should pour oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, and here is its shape:
As you see, make it from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the tube inside can be made of tight-fitting brass, and if you prefer, take a cork and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then pour the oil or juice, or any of these medicines into the tube while it is in the ear. Then insert the cork with cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil flows into the ear canal and you feel it.
Have the patient enter with the medicine, and let what you pour into the ear be warmed slightly in fire. Be careful that the substance you are using is not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter Seven.
On the Treatment of Obstructive Conditions of the Ear.
Some children are born with their ear canals not pierced.
It may also happen to some people that their ear canal becomes blocked due to a wound or tissue growth, and this obstruction may occur deep within the ear canal where it cannot be seen.
It may also appear slightly outside the ear canal and be visible. That which occurs deep within the ear canal and is not visible is usually difficult to remove. However, that which is visible should be placed in sunlight. And you should examine it; if you see the valve clearly, then open it with a fine scalpel; this is how it appears:.
Its tip should be slightly thickened at the end, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides to avoid injuring the ear. If the obstruction is flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it gently with a fine forceps and cut it carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a thin, smooth probe and warm it slightly over fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction and the patient feels a heaviness or blockage in hearing, gently push it aside.
Be careful not to injure the auditory nerve, then place a thread in the ear according to the size of the opening, coated with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed or take a thread and moisten it with water and sprinkle it with finely powdered antimony.
Use it, and if you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, then remove the thread and replace it with another thread coated in kyroti made with rose oil to calm the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, moisten a sponge or cloth with cold water and place it on the ear. Use other treatments to stop the bleeding as mentioned in the section on hemostasis.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear in the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry; they should be grasped with a forceps or similar instrument and cut at their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered zinc to the area.
If bleeding occurs from them, treat it with a small convex iron; cauterization after cutting is better. Often they return if any of the root remains, but if cauterized with fire, that remaining root will be burned and they will not recur.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of transient cold in the eyelids.
Often, something resembling coldness appears in the eyelids in terms of its severity and hardness.
And thus it is called coldness, which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment for this condition is to observe; if the coldness appears prominently on the surface of the eyelid and can move in all directions, then its treatment is easy. Make a shallow incision across it.
Then carefully peel it away from all sides until it is completely removed, then grasp it with forceps and cut it. If you cannot cut it immediately without penetrating the eyelid, it will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, stitch it up and treat it until it heals.
If the incision is small, there is no harm; the ointment will heal and seal it. If the coldness is inclined towards the inner part of the eyelid near the inner surface, turn the eyelid over and grasp the coldness with forceps without needing to make an incision, and trim it from all sides.
If the eyelid is cut through, it does no harm, then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the pad and treat the area to heal until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of chalazion that occurs in the eyelid.
A chalazion is a hard lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it affects children more than others. It burdens their eyes, and they suffer from nighttime symptoms, unable to look at sunlight. Because tears rush to them.
That is why you often see them leaning on their faces and sleeping in that position, with their eyelids wet and swollen due to the chalazion, which is visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the chalazion between them. The procedure should be performed with the patient placing their head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle with that wick around the chalazion on all sides. Then place it over the chalazion and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the chalazion in the center of the circle.
Then cut through the center of that swelling with a sharp scalpel, making a transverse incision that should not be larger than what is made in venesection. As for depth, you must cut through the entire skin until you reach the chalazion.
In most cases, the chalazion will protrude from the incision in the form of a white fatty lump. You should pull it out with a piece of cloth you have wrapped between your fingers to the outside while rotating your hand left and right until it is completely removed. Be careful not to enlarge the incision so that the scalpel does not damage the eye.
If the tendons do not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should extend it gently until they become visible, then pull them out as previously described. Then soak a piece of cloth in vinegar and water and apply it to the area, securing it with a bandage. Some people crush salt and use it.
He should place it inside the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing dressings until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On Methods of Eye Bandaging.
If extra eyelashes grow outside the natural course beneath the normal lashes and persist, they harm the eye, causing various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, cloudiness, and thickening, potentially leading to blindness.
Eye bandaging is done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by using a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the section on cauterization, or it can be done by cutting and suturing, or using reeds as I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap and flip the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle through with the thread near the hairline, then pull the thread up with the eyelid.
Flip it with a probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid below the excess hair from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus using a scalpel. Then pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then secure it to the eyelid with adhesive.
Like the shape of an ace card, but it should be proportional to how much you want to raise the eyelid, as people differ in this regard. Some may need to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how loose the eyelid is.
And some may need less cutting, all of which depends on the looseness of the eyelid. Then, cut with a scalpel along the two lines you have marked, starting from the greater commissure to the lesser commissure, and each incision should be near the natural hairline, about as thick as a thread.
Then insert the forceps into one corner of the skin and peel it all off. Then, stitch together the two lips with a fine needle and thread made of wool. Clean the blood and secure any remaining threads to the eyebrows with adhesive substances if necessary.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it does not matter. Then, leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound unstitched and treat it with substances that dry and contract, as the eyelid will rise when the wound heals and closes. Stitching is better, however.
This method of lifting has been described by earlier practitioners, though it may be burdensome for the patient. It is considered good work and carries no significant risk. Another method of lifting involves marking the eyelid with a shape like that of an ace card, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps that may be spread apart or brought together in this manner:.
Then cut off any excess eyelid skin with small scissors in this manner with moderation:.
If you cannot stop the bleeding from the arteries and they do not clot for you, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger vein and a third thread near the smaller vein, then gather the threads between your fingers with moderation and raise them moderately.
Lift the marked skin as described, then stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, alleviate that swelling with cerotic ointment and similar soothing remedies.
The lower eyelid may also turn inward, causing the lashes to irritate. You should use the methods mentioned for cutting, stitching, and treating with heat or a sharp medicine. Treating with heat or a sharp medicine is more effective and less burdensome on the patient compared to cutting and stitching. Cutting and stitching are more suitable in certain cases.
Treating with reed is done in this manner: Turn the eyelid inside out and make an incision as described from the inner part, then prepare two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to that of the eyelid and their width less than that of a scalpel.
Cut notches at the ends of both sides where the threads will be attached, then gently bring them together on the excess part of the eyelid. Tighten the reeds from both sides firmly and leave it for several days. The stretched skin will die, turn black, and become necrotic.
Until it falls off on its own. If it delays, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it heals, the eyelid will return to its normal position and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye. This is an image of the reeds which you should make in this shape and measure exactly for length and width: .
Chapter Twelve.
في رفع الشعر الناخر من العين بالإبرة.
إذا كانت شعرة أو شعرتين، العمل في ذلك أن تأخذ إبرة رقيقة فتدخل فيها خيطا من حرير رقيق أملس ثم تجمع طرفيه وتعقدهما عقدة لطيفة جدّا وليكن طول الخيط نحو شبر.
ثم تركّب في الأنشوطة خيطا آخر رقيقا دونه في القصر واعقد طرفيه إن شئت ثم يضع العليل رأسه في حجرك وليكن بقرب الشمس ليستبين العمل فإنّه عمل دقيق ثم تدخل الإبرة بالأنشوطة في أصل الشعرة الزائدة.
وتنفذها في الجفن بالعجلة حتى تخرجها من فوق الشعر الطبيعي ثم تجذب الخيط إلى فوق الأنشوطة وتدخل في الأنشوطة تلك الشعرة إن كانت واحدة أو اثنتين أو ثلاث لا أكثر.
ثم تجذب يدك بها حتى تخرج الشعرة مع الأنشوطة في الجفن مع الشعر الطبيعي فإن جذبت الأنشوطة ولم تخرج الشعرة معها جذبت الأنشوطة إلى أسفل بالخيط الذي كنت ركّبت فيها حتى تخرج الأنشوطة من الثقب الأعلى.
ثم تعيد الشعرة فيها وتجذبهما تفعل ذلك حتى ترتفع في الثقب الأعلى وتراها رأي العين، فحينئذ فسلّ الأنشوطة والخيط وأخرجهما وشدّ العين واتركها مشدودة يومين أو ثلاثة حتى تلزم الشعرة مكانها وينبت عليها اللحم.
If the hair is short, either add a long strand of natural hair to it so that it lifts with it, or leave it until it grows longer over time, then lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of the strand that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The condition that affects this strand is called "arnabiyah," and this strand can be either natural or accidental. The accidental type results from the infection of a wound, cut, cauterization, or similar causes.
The approach to treating it is to incise that infection and separate its edges, then insert a thread made of linen between them until it heals. It should not be treated with substances that dry and contract the tissue.
If you do that, the strand will contract more severely than before. Instead, use substances that relax it, such as fenugreek and flaxseed mixed with water in which a sheep's head and linseed have been cooked, and ointment made from diachylon dissolved with some fat. Apply this mixture to treat it.
The key to treating it is to strive by all means to prevent it from adhering in the way it was initially. The treatment we mentioned is part of repairing the strand but does not completely restore the area to its original state.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of the strand that is in the lower eyelid.
This strip that is from the inner layer is actually called a true strip and it is natural and transverse. The transverse one is from a wound, incision, cautery, or similar.
The method of working with it is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left jugular vein to the right jugular vein until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh. Then, lift the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, otherwise take a probe and place it at the site of the incision, then flip the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of these incisions reaching the corners of the cut you made so that they meet, forming an angle. Until when they come together, it takes on a shape like this:.
It is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that piece of flesh until the sharp edge is lower than the part near the eyelid. Then, gather the scattered parts with two stitches using wool thread and treat it with the relaxing medications and bandaging as mentioned until it heals.
If the strip is transverse from an incision, suture, or cautery, it is necessary to make a slight incision without cutting the eyelashes as previously mentioned, then separate the edges with bandaging as described.
In summary, the treatment of a strip, whether it is from above or below, should be carried out according to what appears appropriate for the appearance of the strip. It may vary greatly in form, and the skilled craftsman devises a method by whatever means possible.
Until the shape is restored to its natural form or comes close to it, and the disease itself will guide you as to what treatment and instrument are suitable in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion often occurs in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions. It is necessary to insert a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it up or stretch it with pincers, then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel that is not as sharp as other cutting instruments but slightly blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure and cause injury to the eye with its sharpness. Your cutting should be like peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the adhesion is completely healed. Then pour salty water into the eye to wash it or drip a solution of Syaf Al-Zanjari diluted in water into it, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton swab.
Place a piece of wool soaked in egg white on top of the eye. After three days, use ointments until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On Cutting Nails and Removing Excess Tissue from the Fingertips.
The nail condition comes in two types: either it is neural, resembling a hard and thin membrane, or it is non-neural, resembling solid white moisture that breaks if touched by metal or removed with pincers.
And no hook was placed in it, and both types begin from the greater horn to cover the pupil gradually until light and eye movement are blocked, and the purpose of cutting it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the fingernail with a slightly curved hook and extend it upwards. Then take a needle and thread a strong hair from horse or ox into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and insert it into the center of the fingernail.
Then pass it through with the needle and tie the fingernail with thread, extend it upwards, and peel off one side of the fingernail toward the pupil as if spreading it out with the hair to its end. Then cut the remaining part at the base of the eyelid with a fine scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the eyelid.
To avoid continuous tearing from cutting it, you can extend the fingernail with the hook alone or with thread as we said, then peel off the end with a smooth scalpel, such is its shape:.
Be careful that the scalpel does not touch the corneal membrane to avoid causing a tear, thus damaging the pupil. After cutting, place some powdered salt or zangari shayaf in the eye and leave it for another day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the fingernail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or fix a hook in it, this type of fingernail is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth, weak-edged scalpel in this form:. Smooth the nail with it from above gently; if you see that it splits and crumbles, and there is an effect in smoothing, then drop at once into the eye some of Zangari Syrup or red syrup or powdered salt, and leave the eye for another day.
Then repeat the process until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling appears in the eye, in which case leave it and treat the swelling until it heals, then resume smoothing it until it heals. As for the flesh tags of the conjunctiva:
If the tag severely irritates the eye, attach it with a forceps and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting to avoid causing tearing, then drop into the conjunctival sac red syrup or Zangari syrup until it heals,.
Chapter Seventeen.
On Cutting Warts and Excess Tissue Growth in the Eye.
In the eyes of some people, red flesh may grow in layers until it covers the pupil or nearly does so, or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling the flower of the oleander.
The procedure involves the patient placing his head in your lap, then opening his eyes, and you grasp all that red flesh with appropriate forceps.
Or hold it with a needle or clip, then cut the flesh bit by bit until all of it is removed, being careful not to injure the eye during the procedure. You may use either the scalpel described for cutting nails or a small scissors for the cutting. As for the forceps used in surgery, here is how they are depicted in the following chapter.
When the cutting is complete and all the bleeding has stopped, fill the eye with finely ground salt or sprinkle red powder and similar corrosive medicines. Apply a pad held in place by egg white from outside to prevent inflammation.
If some bleeding persists and blood overpowers, fearing inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the inflammation. Then return to work on it until it heals. Do the same for excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or appearance with iron instruments. Do not proceed with any of these treatments until you are certain that the organ can withstand such work.
Chapter Eighteen.
On Removing Cataracts from the Eye.
Cataracts are red veins that form on the eye, preventing sight and weakening the eye over time. First, you should examine the eye; if it is strong and has no other disease except cataracts.
At that point, the removal is done by having the patient place their head in your lap. Then, you attach those veins with one or two forceps according to your skill. The forceps should have delicate curves as shown in this figure:.
Or they can be double forceps in one body as shown in this figure:.
Then, with a fine pair of scissors, carefully grasp those vessels and wipe the blood from time to time until you see that those vessels have disappeared and the blood has ceased flowing. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors. And let your work be done in half a day facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those vessels. When you finish, instill a healing green or red liquid in the eye to clear any remaining passages with its sharpness. If you cannot remove it all at that time, dress the eye with something that alleviates the pain of the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and you are safe from inflammation. Then repeat this procedure in the same manner until she is healed, this being the way to relieve her of the pain.
And leave it [with the patient's head in the lap of the apprentice and another wipes away the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, while you] are the principal in the work by opening the eye with forceps that are held by an assistant.
Place the patient's head in the lap of the apprentice, and have another wipe away the tears and examine the front and back of the eye. You may start the extraction from the top of the eye or from the bottom, but it is preferable to place two forceps in the upper part: one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at its beginning.
And hold them between the middle and index fingers, then attach forceps beneath each, and hold them between the little finger and ring finger. Lift your hand lightly until you see that all the passages have risen; then cut from the lesser outside with scissors or a fine scalpel if needed.
And the catheter is inserted into the needles, and all paths are cleared until it rises above the glans, but do not cut off the evacuation because tears and blood will soften for you.
Then cut with scissors what exceeds the crown both from above and below, so that nothing remains embedded except in the cornea. If possible, raise it off the cornea using a catheter; this is better. It may occur in some people.
And when you cut it, its place will itch for days until the pain subsides and the hot swelling subsides. Then repeat the procedure on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On Reinserting the Cartilage into the Nose.
The doctors call the cartilage nasorus; if you treat it with cauterization or with a potent burning medicine as previously described and it does not heal, then the only remedy is to incise the abscess when it is ripe and extract all the moisture inside or the pus.
Until the bone is exposed; if the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening in it, then remove it with a tool whose shape is as follows:.
It is called the coarse-headed tool, made of Indian iron, with its head rounded like a button, engraved with fine engravings similar to those of scissors. Place it on the site of corruption in the bone and rotate it between your fingers while slightly tensing your hand until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, then treat the area with drying and contracting medicines. If the area heals, flesh grows in it, and no discharge occurs during the period, and after forty days it does not recur or show any signs of change.
Know that he is cured, otherwise there is no remedy but to return the fistula to the nostril in this manner: which is to expose the bone a second time with an instrument or with a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a probe in this form:.
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft should be conical, tapering to the end as you see. Then place it on the bone itself; this should be near the throat but keep your hand a little away from the eye. Then move your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
When he finds that air comes out when he pinches his nose, at this point apply astringent and drying medicines as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the substance that was discharging externally will return to the nostril, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Eyelid Disorders.
If the eyelid contracts without affecting vision or causing any deficiency, it is advisable to ease the patient and then apply a poultice. Then place a bloodletting spot at the back of the head without any specific condition and perform light cupping.
Then apply a soft poultice to the eye made from acacia, wormwood, frankincense, and aloes. Then secure the eye above with many bandages; the method of making these bandages is to take flexible strips and fold each one four times to create many bandages.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then secure it with a strong bandage tightly, and repeat the cupping by suction without any condition. Then remove the cupping device and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has improved, otherwise, repeat the dressing, medication, tightening, and cupping until it improves.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cutting the Urethra.
If a hernia occurs in the urethral membrane, and it protrudes outside the eyelids resembling a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure should be as I describe.
The procedure is to insert a needle into the base of the hernia from bottom to top, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the trachea and pass it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the midpoint of the doubled thread, tie it around some part of the hernia along with the needle and tighten it well. Then remove the needle and place wet wool soaked in egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the hernia. Then treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals. You may also secure the hernia from all sides with a circular bandage to make the eye more prominent, then tightly bind it. Use a thin scalpel to reach deep into the eye to drain the white moisture, and let the eye settle down and shrink to its place, then bind it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
في علاج الكمينة.
هذه العلة التي تسمى الكمنة إنما هي مدة تجتمع في العين تشبه الماء النازل وليس به، ووجه العمل في ذلك أن تقعد المريض على كرسي منتصبا ثم تأخذ رأسه بيديك من الجهتين.
وتحركه حتى ترى المدة تصير إلى أسفل بعينك ثم تثبت ولا تزول وينطلق النور ويري العليل الأشياء كما كان يراها، وإن لم تنزل إلى أسفل علمنا أنه الماء، فإن لم يتهيأ نزول المدة بما ذكرنا.
وإلا فأجلس المريض بين يديك ثم خذ مبضعًا رقيقًا وشق به فوق الغشاء القorneal قليلاً عند اتصال الملتحم بالغشاء القorneal في الإكليل حتى تخرج المادة.
فإذا خرجت فقطر في العين ماء حارًا قد مزجت فيه عسلًا أو ماء قد أغليت فيه حلبة وعسل ثم تعالج بسائر العلاج حتى يبرأ،.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
قد ذكرنا أنواع الماء في التقسيم وأيها يصلح للقدح بكلام مشروح مفسر فتأخذه من هناك على الصحة، فحينئذ ينبغى أن تجلس المريض بين يديك متربعًا قبال الضوء قرب الشمس.
Bind his healthy eye tightly, then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the lancet near the cornea, about the thickness of a hair in the white part of the eye towards the inner corner. Then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel that the lancet has reached an empty space.
It is important that the lancet reaches a depth equal to the distance from the child's pupil to the edge of the iris, for copper can be seen clearly through the cornea due to its clarity. Then move the lancet upwards to the place where the fluid is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly; if the fluid comes out immediately, the patient will see what is before him as soon as his sight is opened, and the lancet will be in his eye. Then let it rest for a while; if the fluid rises again, bring it down once more without removing the lancet.
When it settles and does not rise again, gently remove the lancet while twisting your hand little by little. Then dissolve some fine clean salt in the fluid and wash the inside of the eye with it. Place a piece of linen or wet wool around the entire outer part of the eye.
Apply rose ointment and the white of an egg, and bind the healthy eye with it. As for us and people of our time, we place ground cumin mixed with the white of an egg on it. If the lancet does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. You should take the knife called Al-Birud, which has this shape:.
Then, make an incision only in the conjunctiva and do not go deep. It is sufficient to gently tap the area with a probe as we described, then insert the probe as mentioned. When you complete your work, prepare for the patient a secure place to lie down and rest on their back in a dark room.
He must avoid all movements and coughing. His food should be what softens his nature without causing movement. He must not move his head left or right at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, after which it is removed in that dark room, and then you test his vision.
Show him various objects, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. It is not advisable to do this during treatment or immediately after piercing, as water rises quickly due to intense staring.
If a hot swelling appears, you should remove the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what calms the swelling. Once the swelling subsides, then release his vision and place a scarf over his face so that he can see through it from underneath for several days while in the dark room, then.
He should gradually leave the house and resume his activities. Know that the learner cannot do without observation many times, so he must proceed with caution when working. I have heard from some Iraqis that they make in Iraq a porous probe to absorb water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient books. It may be a recent invention. This is an image of various types of probes for those who are unfamiliar with them:.
It is made of copper and its tip should be of this thinness, triangular and sharp.
Chapter Twenty-four.
On the treatment of flesh growths in the nose.
Various types of excess flesh may grow in the nose, some resembling small spider-like growths with many legs, others being hard and cancerous-looking, dark-colored tumors, and there is also soft flesh that is not dark-colored.
For those growths that are soft, not malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit in front of you facing the sun, and you should open their nostril and insert the probe into the growth, then pull it outwards, and cut what can be reached with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Continue until you are sure that all the flesh has been removed. If there is any part left that you cannot cut, carefully scrape it off with one of the fine instruments so that nothing remains. If bleeding becomes too severe or if a hot swelling occurs,
counter it as appropriate, or if it is a malignant tumor, act promptly to remove it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then, after cutting, pour vinegar and water or some drink into the nose so that it opens up and the moisture passes down to the throat.
Know that he has recovered, but if the moisture does not pass as it should, know that there is excess flesh growing in the upper parts of the porous bones, which the instrument did not reach. In this case, you should take a linen thread of some thickness.
And it is tied with many knots, and there should be the length of a finger or less between each knot. The patient devises to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever means he can fashion like a button, then pulls it until it reaches the trachea.
It is pulled out at the throat; often boys in school do something like this, and it is easy for whoever wants to do it. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been separated by the knots in the thread. Then remove the thread and after wiping away the blood, insert a wick saturated with Egyptian ointment into the nose; do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then finally, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals. If drying treatment is needed, use that.
And this is the image of the dropper used to administer fat and medicines into the nose:.
He places one made of silver or copper, resembling a small lamp with an open reservoir and its channel designed similarly.
And if you prefer, make the tube closed like a reed and have the dropper's reservoir flat.
It has a handle at the end as you can see, which is held when the fat or any juice or liquid substance is heated inside it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
في الثآليل الناشئة في طرف الأنف.
كثيرًا ما ينبت في طرف الأنف ثآليل تنمو وتزداد مع الأيام حتى تشوه مظهره.
ولذلك ينبغي أن تقطعه في أول ظهوره وتستأصل جميعه ثم تحمل على الموضع إما الكي وإما الدواء المحرق الذي يقوم مقام الكي، فإن فات قطعه حتى يعظم فانظر فإن كان متحجرا صلبا كمد اللون قليل الحس.
فلا تعرض له بالحديد فإنما هو ورم سرطاني وكثيرا ما رأيت من قطع هذا الورم فعادت منه بليه عظيمة على صاحبه، وإن كان الورم لين المجهس غير كمد اللون ورأيت أن القطع يمكن في جميعه. فاصرف عن المريض الغذاء واقطعه بلا حذر ولا توقف وعالج الموضع بما يجفف ويقبض حتى يبرأ،.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
في خياطة الأنف والشفة والأذن. إذا تفرقت اتصالها بجرح أو نحو ذلك أعلم أنه متى حدث تفرق في اتصال واحدة من هذه الغضاريف قل ما ينجع فيه العمل إلا في بعض الناس.
فينبغي متى عرض لأحد شئ من ذلك فانظر إن كان الجرح طريًا بدمه أن تجمع شفتي الجرح بالخياطة ثم تعالجه حتى يبرأ، وإن كان تفرق الاتصال قد افترقت شفته وصار كل شق صحيحًا فينبغي أن تسلخ كل شق بثخن جلده الظاهر حتى يدمى.
Then gather the lips by sewing them together and tighten it, and sprinkle powdered mastic and frankincense on it. Place a layer of the Aleppo ointment or another cohesive ointment above the dressing. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then release it.
And change the medicine and leave it until the stitches come out by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of sewing is to bring together what has been separated either with needles as we described for sewing the abdomen or with thread as I have explained to you there.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On Removing Knots That Occur in the Lips.
Many people have small hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling corns and others varying in size. You should flip the lip and make an incision on each knot and secure it with a forceps.
Cut it from all sides, then fill the area after cutting with powdered myrtle until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt. Treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On Removing Excess Tissue from the Gums.
Excess tissue often grows on the gums, which Apollonius called "bull's neck." You should secure it with a forceps or hold it with a probe and cut it at its base. Allow any bleeding to stop, then apply powdered myrtle to the area.
And if one of the constricting dried plaques persists after treatment, it often returns, so cut it again and cauterize it, for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On examining teeth with iron.
On the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, there may accumulate rough, ugly scales that can become black, yellow, or green, until this decay reaches the gum and thus the teeth become unsightly.
You should seat the patient between your hands and place his head in your lap. Then, clean the tooth or tooth that appears to have scales resembling sand until nothing remains. Do the same for black, green, yellow, and other discolorations until they are completely cleaned.
If what is in it disappears upon the first cleaning, otherwise repeat the cleaning on a second day and third day until you reach your goal. Know that the tooth requires various tools of different shapes and forms according to what suits your work.
Because the tool used to clean a tooth from inside is different from the one used to clean it from outside, and the one used between the teeth has a different shape. Here are several types of cleaning tools that you should have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
You should treat the tooth for its pain with every means possible and hesitate to extract it, as once extracted, there is no substitute for it, for it is a precious substance. Only extract it if there is no alternative.
It is necessary when the patient decides to extract a tooth that you verify until you are sure that the painful tooth is the one to be extracted. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in the healthy tooth, so he has it extracted, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is removed. We have seen this happen repeatedly due to the actions of barbers.
When you are sure about the specific painful tooth, then it is necessary to cut around the tooth with a strong scalpel until the gum is separated from all sides, then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little until it becomes loose.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and place the patient's head between your knees to stabilize him so that he does not move. Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and gently but firmly insert it under the tooth from all sides as you did initially to move it.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, it is necessary to fill that hole with a piece of cloth and seal it well with a thin end of a twisted thread so that it does not disintegrate when you grip it with forceps. It is also necessary to carefully cut around the gum from all sides.
Be cautious with your effort so that you do not break the tooth, as leaving part of it behind would cause greater harm to the patient than their initial pain. Beware of doing what ignorant barbers do in dealing with front teeth, acting rashly to extract them without using the methods we have described.
Often they suffer from great plagues, the least of which is that a tooth breaks but its entire or part of its root remains. Or it may be pulled out along with some of the jawbone, as we have seen many times. Then after removing it, rinse the area with a decoction or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, this often happens, so crush some myrtle at that time and apply it to the spot.
Otherwise, use pliers if the myrtle is ineffective. Here are images of delicate pliers used to move the tooth; initially, they have long prongs and short handles, thick so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And here are images of larger pliers:
They have thick handles so that when you grip them, they do not bend. The prongs are short and should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with the tips having grooves that fit into each other for a firm secure hold.
The prongs can also be made in the shape of a chisel, making them strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On Extracting Tooth Roots and Removing Broken Jawbones.
If the root remains after extracting a tooth and it has broken, you should place a cotton pad soaked in fat on the area for one or two days until the site softens. Then insert the probe or pliers into it. Whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called balrajah. This is an image of the pliers:
If it has been made like a scalpel inside or like an ice pick, then if you cannot extract with these clamps, you should dig around the base and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the tool which resembles a small lever, whose shape is as follows:.
Short at one end, slightly thick, and should not be too flexible so that it does not break. If the base comes out with this, otherwise use these other tools whose shapes are as follows: the first has a triangular tip and is somewhat thick:.
A delicate triangular shape:image caption missing, original might refer to an image description or illustration note.
We may also use this tool with two prongs, whose shape is as follows:.
And other tools and instruments that were mentioned earlier for examining teeth. We may also use this tool which resembles a large fish hook, whose shape is as follows:.
Triangular at the end, slightly curved and thick to prevent breaking, and should not be too flexible. Know that there are many tools for teeth, and similarly, other tools are numerous and cannot be counted; a skilled craftsman may invent his own tools according to what he learns from practice and the diseases themselves.
Because there are diseases for which earlier practitioners did not provide tools due to the variety of types, then if a bone in the jaw or one of the bones in the mouth breaks or becomes rotten, examine it in its place with what is suitable from these tools and clamps mentioned for extracting roots.
And we may use this tool, whose shape is as follows:.
It should have some thickness to hold the bone in place so that it does not slip until the bone is out, and we treat the area with appropriate medications. If the bone has a slight decay or discoloration, remove it until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On spreading the protruding teeth.
If the teeth grow out of their natural course, they become unsightly, especially if this happens to women and slaves. It should be examined; if a tooth has grown behind another tooth, then action should be taken.
If it is not possible to spread or straighten the tooth, then remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument whose image is as follows:.
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron. The cutting should be done over several days due to the hardness of the tooth and to avoid disturbing other teeth. If it protrudes significantly for straightening, straighten it with a plane made of Indian material, whose image is as follows:.
It should be entirely made of Indian material, with a fine engraving that resembles the blade used to make needles. Use it to gradually straighten the tooth over many days gently so as not to dislodge the tooth and cause it to fall out. Finally, polish and clean it with some polishing tools.
If a tooth is broken and causes discomfort to the tongue when speaking, it should also be smoothed until the roughness of the break disappears, making it even and smooth so that it does not harm the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose or dislodged due to a blow or fall, and if the patient is unable to bite on anything for fear of them falling out, and treatment with binding medications has been ineffective.
The solution is to bind them with a gold or silver thread, and gold is better because silver can tarnish and rot after days, whereas gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of medium thickness, fitting appropriately between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the two healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose tooth or teeth until the weaving reaches the healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Then, weave back to the side where you started, and gently and wisely tighten your hand so that it does not move at all. Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip. Then, cut off any excess thread with scissors, tie them together, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
To avoid injuring the tongue, leave it tightly bound for as long as necessary. If it loosens or breaks, retighten it with a new thread so that it can be used this way for all of life. This is an illustration of the teeth and the method of binding between two healthy teeth and two loose teeth as you see: .
A single tooth or two can be returned to their place after falling out and reinserted as described, and it will remain in place. This is done by a craftsman who is skilled in such work, and sometimes bone from the bones of an ox is carved into the shape of a tooth and placed where the tooth has been lost. It is secured as we have said, and it will remain in place and be enjoyed.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the band that appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This band that appears under the tongue may be either naturally present since birth or it may be due to a wound that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and placing their head in your lap, then raising their tongue and cutting that nerve band horizontally until the tongue is free from restriction. If it is somewhat stiff or complex, and this is due to a healed wound, use a scalpel to cut it horizontally until the band is severed and untangled.
Be careful that the cut does not go too deep into the flesh and sever a blood vessel, causing bleeding. After the cut, rinse the area with rose water or vinegar diluted in cold water. Then place a linen thread under the tongue, which the patient should hold each night.
To prevent it from rejoining again. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered zinc to the area. If the blood overpowers you, seal the wound with a lens-shaped iron, which is suitable for this purpose. Then treat him with all forms of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the Removal of a Toad Developing Under the Tongue.
A swelling like a small toad may occur under the tongue, which prevents it from functioning normally and might grow so large as to fill the mouth. The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and observing the swelling.
If you see that it is pale or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not intervene as it is likely a cancer. If it tends to be white with moisture, use forceps to grasp it and carefully cut it open with a sharp scalpel, then remove it thoroughly from all sides.
If bleeding overwhelms you during the procedure, apply powdered turmeric to stop the blood flow. Once the bleeding has stopped, continue your work until it is completely removed, then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all appropriate treatments until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the Treatment of Tonsil Swellings.
Any tumors that grow in the throat may include glands inside the throat that resemble external glands, known as tonsils. If you treat them as described in the classification and they do not heal, ...
Examine it: if the tumor is hard, pale, and insensitive, do not intervene with instruments. If it is red in color and its base is firm, also avoid treating it with instruments to prevent bleeding; instead, leave it until it matures, whereupon it may either burst on its own or be treated accordingly.
And if it is white in color and round, and its origin is thin, then this is what should be cut. The procedure is that you observe before working on it whether the hot inflammation has completely subsided or has diminished somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun and place his head in your lap. Open his mouth and have a servant by your side who will press down his tongue with an instrument, which is pictured as follows:.
Make it from silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue with this instrument and the swelling becomes visible to your sight, take a hook and insert it into the gland, pulling it out as far as possible without drawing anything of the membranes along with it.
Then cut it with an instrument whose shape is similar to scissors, but its ends are curved, and each end is very sharp. It should be made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with scissors of this shape:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one gland, cut the other in the same manner. Then after cutting, gargle the patient's mouth with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranate or oak leaves or something similar that stops bleeding have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he is healed. Other tumors may also grow in the throat besides the glands, and you should cut them as I have mentioned for cutting the glands, alike.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, extending to the larynx with little sensation, which almost blocked the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and could not eat or drink water.
She was on the verge of death if she had waited one or two more days, as a branch from the tumor had emerged through her nostrils. I acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, removing a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where I could reach from the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down on her tongue, and inserted the hook directly into the tumor. Then I removed some of it, and only a little blood flowed from it.
Her throat was immediately clear, and she began to drink water and eat food. We continued to remove parts of the tumor repeatedly over a long period of time, as the tumor kept regenerating what was cut. This process went on for some time.
I devised a strategy and treated the tumor inside her throat, causing it to stop growing. Then I left the area, and I do not know what God did for her after my departure.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On Cutting a Tumor in the Soft Palate.
It is called a grape if it descends to the soft palate and becomes inflamed; if it is white and elongated, it is called a pillar, but if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a grape. If it is treated as mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed.
I saw that the hot tumor had subsided in her, and she was thin; therefore, it should be cut. But if it is gathered together, round, and does not have a length, and if it is pale or the color of mucus or black or insensitive, then cutting should be avoided.
Therefore, there are secrets for the patient; if you see it in the manner described with its whiteness and length, then sit the patient facing the sun and press his tongue with the instrument that was previously described, then pierce the tumor with the lancet.
And pull it downward and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned for cutting the tonsils; however, you should not cut more than what exceeds the natural state without excess, because if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use what was described for cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is too fearful to undergo cutting, you should employ a cautery method without fear or caution. The approach in cauterizing is with a sharp medication, placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that was mentioned, then take the sharp water that was described in the section on cauterization and mix it into a dough that is neither too thick nor too thin. Fill this indentation of the instrument, and here is its image:.
Its tip where the medicine is placed should be indented like the indentation of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the palate itself while the patient lies on his side so that saliva flows out from inside his throat to prevent anything from dripping into his throat and causing harm.
Then grasp the medicine with your hand and squeeze it onto the spatula for about half an hour until you see it turn black and the sting of the medicine subsides. If you wish, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a rod, and dip the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the rod with the cotton into a tube from above so that the cotton adheres to the spatula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want in drying the grape. Then leave it; it will wilt and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After cauterization, wipe around the grape with cotton soaked in fat to clean the area around it of any remaining medicine. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and more reassuring than other methods.
The spatula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting. It can be treated with frankincense in this manner: Take fūzhēng (a type of plant), zuofa (likely a misinterpretation or archaic term), saffron, rosemary, wormwood, chamomile, and similar herbs. Gather all of them or some of them in a pot and cover them with vinegar.
Boil it while the pot is sealed with clay of wisdom, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid through which you attach a hollow device made in this manner, which can be made of silver or copper:.
Insert the end with the bulge into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the spatula through the tube, causing it to become coated with moisture. Repeat this several times until it wilts. Be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the tumor's appearance.
For often the swelling increases, and you should do this when her hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument at hand, take a reed and attach an eggshell to one end so that it does not burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, and this is excellent in treatment and safe.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing thorns and other objects embedded in the throat.
Often a bone or fish spine or other objects embed in the throat, so you should remove what is visible after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the light.
So that you can see what is in the throat. For what is hidden and concealed within, you should induce vomiting before the food digests in the stomach; perhaps the object will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of soft bread instead.
Or have the patient swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a string; then have them swallow it. When it reaches the area of the spine, pull the string quickly. Do this repeatedly.
Often the spine or bone will stick to it and be removed. If it does not come out as mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:.
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a curved end. The patient inserts it gently into their throat with their head raised, being careful not to touch the throat to avoid causing coughing. Use it to push out the bone or spine, or the doctor can insert it by hand.
And introducing the patient is better for his knowledge of the position of the embedded object, and he pushes it downward or pulls his hand upward with the instrument, all of this according to what is prepared until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Removing Embedded Leeches from the Throat.
If the leech is treated with the medications mentioned in the division and it does not succeed, then at that time examine the patient's throat in sunlight after compressing his tongue with the instrument described to you.
If your gaze falls on the leech, then pull it out with a small hook or a thin, firm spatula. If you are unable to do so, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a heated iron into the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and the patient should abstain from water for the entire day. Then take a container filled with cold water, have the patient open his mouth over it, and rinse with it without swallowing any of it, and stir the water occasionally with his hand.
When the leech senses the water, it will fall into the container. If it does not come out as described, then fumigate the throat with urine and hartshorn using the instrument described for fumigating the mouth. Do this repeatedly, and it will fall out.
The method of working with fumigation is to take a container with hot charcoal from the fire, and the container should be covered with a lid that has a hole in it. Attach one end of the instrument to this hole, then place the fumigant inside. The patient places his mouth on the other end of the tube and seals his mouth so that the smoke does not escape until he knows that the smoke has reached his throat.
For the leech falls upon its place, and if it does not fall, then the incense must be repeated several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salted food and garlic, but refrain from drinking water; for by this management it will certainly be expelled. This is a picture of an instrument that attracts the leech from the throat when it comes into view.
It resembles the forceps as you see, except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat, and its ends are like the beak of a bird, rough like a knife; if it clutches anything, it does not let go:.
There is another instrument for pressing down the tongue, which is a wide hoop of iron large enough to fit over the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth vertically on its side so that the mouth remains open without the patient's control and they cannot remove it at all until it is taken off:.
The description of the instrument used to open the mouth in exactly this manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the discussion of binding tumors and incising them.
Tumors are numerous and varied, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in binding and incising them based on two aspects. One of these is the nature of the tumor itself and what moisture it contains.
The second aspect is based on the body parts where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the buttocks, and a tumor occurring in a muscular area is different from one occurring in a joint. Each has its own rule of treatment.
There are tumors that should not be incised until the pus within them has matured and fully formed, and there are others that should be incised even when they are fresh and have not yet fully ripened, such as tumors that are located near joints.
Because when a tumor occurs near a joint and persists until it causes the surrounding area to decay, it may damage the ligaments or nerve of that joint, leading to long-term impairment of the limb, or the tumor may be close to a principal organ.
Because if you delay incising it until it matures, you will damage that principal organ. Or it may be near the buttocks; thus, you should incise it when it is fresh. The reason for this is that you must incise a tumor that is not fully matured but is near the buttocks so that it does not decay deeply and penetrate into the interior of the buttocks, thereby becoming an abscess.
It will result in a condition that may not heal properly. You should know the time to incise tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain in the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, redness and swelling decrease, the head of the tumor hardens, and all other signs indicate it is ready.
You should make the incision at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, so that it is easier for the pus to drain downward, or in the thinnest and most elevated part of the tumor. If the tumors are near the hands and feet, the incision should be made along the length of the body.
Incise in areas away from muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, generally in flat areas with no bends. If the area has bends, make the incision accordingly. However, if the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave it unincised.
Until it is fully mature as we have said, for if you incise it before that time, the discharge of pus from it will be prolonged, and it will be much dirtier and more foul. And sometimes his lips and nostrils may become adherent. Some tumors may be incised on the surface of the body in emergencies or according to what is needed by the part.
You should use a single incision for small tumors and a wide incision or many cuts for larger tumors, according to the size of the tumor. There are also tumors where it may be necessary to scarify the skin and cut it if it has become like parchment.
And it has become to some extent dead, like what is seen in many pouches and cavities. Some of them are cut with a triangular incision, and others are cut in the shape of an oak leaf, such as an arbi tumor.
Some are treated with a circular incision or a crescent-shaped incision and similar cuts. For those that do not have a head, such as smooth flat tumors, it is sufficient to use a simple incision only. If the tumor is large and has collected pus for a long time, when you incise it, do not rush to remove all the pus at once.
Instead, remove some of it and then compress the tumor until another day, then remove some pus again. Repeat this gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for often the vital spirit dissolves with the sudden expulsion of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it. Beware of this matter greatly.
After excising these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the tumor incision is small or if there is a single simple incision, use lint made from old linen or cotton. If the tumor is large and there are many cuts during the excision, do the following.
You should insert a wick into each incision until they meet. If the tumor required cutting through some skin or making a depression, you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture and keep it compressed until the third day.
Then remove the packing and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during this process, use cold water mixed with vinegar; soak a piece of linen in it and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should employ measures and treatments including those described in many places in this book and in the relevant sections. If it is winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should moisten the bandages with hot syrup and oil.
Place them on the affected area. If it is summer and the areas are inflamed, you should apply bandages soaked in cold water and oil or cool syrup and oil. As we said on the third day, you should then unbind the wound and clean it.
Use treatments similar to these until it heals. This is what you need to know generally about treating tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
في شق الأورام التي تظهر في جلد الرأس.
تظهر في جلد الرأس أورام صغيرة وهي من أنواع السليلات التي تحتويها صفيقات، وكأنها غدد الدجاجة. وأنواعها كثيرة، منها الشحمية ومنها ما يحوي رطوبة تشبه الحمأة.
ومنها ما تحوي رطوبة تشبه الدشيش والحساء ونحو ذلك، ومنها ما هي متحجرة صلبة. وكلها لا خطر في شقها وإخراجها ما لم يعترضك عند شقها شريان.
والعمل في شقها أن تسبرها أولاً بالآلة التي تأتي صورتها بعد هذا والتي تسمى المدس حتى تعلم ما تحوي. فإن كان الذي تحويه رطوبة فشقها شقاً على الطول شقًا بسيطًا على هذه الصورة:.
وابدأ بالشق من خط ~ب~ إلى خط ~ج~. فإذا تفرغت الرطوبة، اسلخ الكيس الذي كان يحوي تلك الرطوبة واقطعه جميعًا ولا تترك منه شيئًا البتة، فكثيرا ما يعود إذا بقى منه شيء.
ثم اغمس قطنة في المرهم الصريح إذا حضر، وإلا في ماء الملح واملأ به الجرح واتركه إلى يوم آخر فإنّه يأكل ما بقى من الكيس. ثم أعد عليه القطنة بالمرهم الصريح مرة أخرى وثالثة إن احتجت إلى ذلك.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains a fatty tumor, cut it open in this manner:.
Make a firm incision and place the forceps in the edges of the wound and peel it from all sides, exert yourself in removing the omentum that contains it. If an artery is encountered, do as described to you afterward. Do the same for the swelling if it is hardened by the incision.
The treatment is exactly as I have mentioned, and incising a hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these head tumors in certain people have no moisture at all; indeed, I have incised a tumor where.
I incised a tumor on the head of an old woman and found the tumor hard like a flint, rough and white, so hard that even if someone had thrown it, it would not have broken. None of the other tumors that occur on the head are like this; they are similar to the tumors that appear on the heads of children.
At the roots of the ears, incise them completely with a simple cut and make the bottom open so that the material can easily flow downward. Then treat it with appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two.
On Incising Tumors That Appear on the Neck. These tumors often appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin areas, though they may also appear throughout the body. Those that appear on the neck are usually singular but can be multiple and some arise from others.
Every sow among them is inside its own specific sac, as in scrofulous swellings and tumors of the head as we have described. The types of these sows are many; some are calcified, some contain moisture, and there are those that are corrupt and do not respond to treatment.
And I have not seen any of them in good condition to the touch; its outer appearance was close to the color of the skin, moving in all directions without adhering to the neck nerve or glands or arteries and it was not sunken. It is advisable to make a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this shape, from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~:.
And peel it from all sides and stretch the edges of the skin with a clamp or two clamps or many clamps if needed, as we mentioned in the case of tumors of the head. Remove it little by little and be careful not to cut any vein or nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
So that your hand does not cut unnecessarily or distress the patient by cutting what is not needed. If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders you from working, place powdered cerement or some of the coagulants that stop bleeding in the wound.
And close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides and the wound relaxes, showing signs of suppuration; at this point bleeding will stop. Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there are any remaining smaller sows and cut them out and clean them.
If there is a large gland at the root of the pig's tail, it should not be cut from its root; rather, it should be tied tightly with strong thread until it falls off naturally without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian ointment and treat it accordingly.
If you cut the entire pig's tail and you find that the edges of the wound can be brought together without any leftover tissue, then stitch them immediately after ensuring there is no remaining excess. If you see that some tissue around the bone of the pig's tail remains.
It is necessary to cut at the root and base, then use suturing as we have mentioned. For pigs that contain moisture, apply a simple dressing where you see evidence of healing, and make sure the dressing covers from below as we said.
Then, after the dressing, use bandages dipped in Egyptian ointment or similar to consume any remaining corruption. Once you see that the wound has cleansed, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On Incising the Throat for a Tumor That Occurs Inside the Throat.
The early scholars mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is their sequence of discussion. As for those with acute conditions, they should avoid incising the throat as it does not benefit them.
This is because all the veins and the lung would be diseased. As for those who have a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no issue with the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to avoid the harm that could result from choking.
It is appropriate, if we wish to do so, to make an incision in the throat below three circles of the trachea or four, a small incision across between two circles, as much as the incision in the mesentery and not in the cartilage; this position corresponds to the incision.
Because it has little flesh and the blood vessels are far from it; if the surgeon is timid, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a ligature, then cut the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should make an incision in the mesentery as described, and determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that comes out with it when it is punctured, and from the loss of voice; leave the wound open for a time, and when the period during which choking was feared has passed, bring together the edges of the wound in the skin.
And he makes the incision alone, without the cartilage, then uses medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book explains that the meaning of this statement is when they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors which they mentioned.
And when the patient is near death and his life is in danger, they resort to incising the throat so that the patient can breathe through the wound and be saved from death. They are instructed to leave the wound open until the disease subsides, with its duration being three days or so.
At that time, they were instructed to suture the wound and treat it until it healed. What I witnessed myself was a servant who took a knife and cut her throat with it, severing part of her trachea. She was brought to me for treatment, and she appeared as if she were about to die, like a slaughtered animal. Upon examination, I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood which came out of the wound was little, so I was certain that she had not cut an artery or a vein. The breath came out of the wound, so I quickly stitched the wound and treated it until it healed, and nothing happened to the servant except for hoarseness in her voice no more than that.
And she returned to her best condition after days, so from here we say that cutting the throat is not dangerous.

In the incision on the tumor that appears in the trachea from outside and is called the elephant of the trachea.
This tumor which is called the elephant of the trachea is a large swelling that matches the color of the body, and it is common in women. It comes in two types.
It may be either natural or accidental. As for the natural one, there is no remedy for it. As for the accidental one, it comes in two types: one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to a tumor caused by arterial complications, and its incision is dangerous. It should not be subjected to iron at all unless it is small. If you examine it carefully with your hand and find that it resembles a fatty tumor and is not attached to any veins, then incise it as you would for a fatty tumor. Remove it along with the sac if it is enclosed in one, or else carefully excise all of it and then treat the area as appropriate.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On Incising Various Types of Tumors.
The types of tumors are numerous, and I have mentioned all their kinds in the classification. Here, it is important to explain the difference between a tumor (سلع) and an abscess (خراج), as this is often confusing. I say that an abscess comes with heat, fever, and frightening pains until the inflammation subsides. The pus matures, and then the fever and intensity subside. A tumor does not come with heat, fever, or pain; it is enclosed in a special serous sac that matches the color of the body. It begins like a lentil and grows to resemble a pigeon egg, becoming larger or smaller.
It is of two kinds, either fatty or containing moisture; the colors of the moisture are numerous as mentioned in the division. Therefore, when you proceed to treat the condition, you should first probe and examine it with a tool called medas, as its figure will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
Measure the size of the tumor, then remove the medas and observe what comes out after it. If watery moisture of any color comes out, cut it with a simple incision as mentioned for other tumors. If no moisture comes out after using the medas, know that it is fatty.
Make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and hang it with clamps. Carefully peel the skin away from all sides gently and be cautious not to damage the sac so that you can remove it whole along with the tumor.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole, this often happens. Remove it piece by piece until nothing remains, for if any part of it remains, whether little or much, the condition will likely recur.
If it overpowers you and a small part remains, treat the wound when you finish by applying some sharp corroding substances, then tightly close the wound and place something on top to soothe the hot swelling. Treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If the tumor is large, outline its edges and treat it with what helps in healing.
If a major or minor vein is encountered and bleeding occurs, immediately treat the area with powdered cautery and leave it tightly closed for two or three days until the wound begins to heal and the bleeding stops. Then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.

On the Illustrations of Instruments.
Those that are used for incision and dilation, including illustrations of dilators, which are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Illustration of a Large Dilator:.
Illustration of a Medium Dilator:.
Illustration of a Small Dilator:.
They are made of steel, with square ends to facilitate rapid entry into tumors. These are illustrations of probes, also known as cold instruments, which are likewise of three types: large, medium, and small. Illustration of a Large Probe:.
Illustration of a Medium Probe:.
Illustration of a Small Probe:.
They are suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to determine what is inside them, such as bones or other contents. They are made cylindrical, polished, and smooth like arrows, from Chinese brass, German silver, brass, iron, or silver. The best are those made of German silver.
Probes can also be made of black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas where there is a curvature deep inside, as they can bend with that curvature. They are also of three types: long, medium, and short.
Their size and thickness should be proportional to the depth and width of each fistula. Illustration of a Large Probe Made of Lead:.
Image of a probe made of lead:
Image of a small lead probe:.
Images of forceps, which are numerous types: there are simple ones, meaning those with one jaw, and they are divided into three types: large, medium, and small. There are also blind forceps, which are also divided into three types. Additionally, there are forceps with two jaws, which are also categorized into three types, and there are curved double-jawed forceps. And they are three types, and there are forceps with three jaws, which are also three types. All of these types are needed in their respective places. Image of a simple large forcep:. Image of a medium simple forcep:. Image of a small simple forcep:.

This is an image of scalpels used for incising and dissecting tumors; they are of three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel:.
Image of a medium scalpel:.
Image of a small scalpel:.
Its cutting edges are limited, while the other ends are not. This design is such that it can be used to dissect tumors without fear of cutting a nerve or artery. It also helps the patient feel less discomfort and provides some relief from the burning sensation when dissecting the tumor.
This is an image of lancets; they are of three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large lancet:.
It is made of brass-like metal that is used for inlaying, and on one end it resembles a wide spoon consisting of two layers, with the lancet blade hidden inside, resembling a bird's tongue. It can be extended in and out as desired, as you can see.
This is an image of scalpels that can be concealed between the fingers when dissecting tumors, so the patient does not feel them; they are of three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel:.
Images of lancets used to bleed, which are of three types because there are large, medium, and small ones. Image of the large lancet:.
They are made of brass or porcelain, slightly rounded in length as you can see, and should be thin. You should have these types of lancets in large and small sizes to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medication is not available.
However, do not use it to draw blood from every part of the body but rather use it on muscular areas such as the muscles of the thigh and arm, the calf, the breast, the abdomen, the buttocks, and similar moist muscular organs.
They can also be made into other small tools that resemble pistachio shells, as shown in this image:.
It is used to stop bleeding from the site of bloodletting or when cutting a vein or artery. It can also be made round, as shown in this image:.
Chapter Forty-Seven:
On the Treatment of Gynecomastia in Men:
Which resembles the breasts of women, some people's breast may swell at puberty to resemble those of women, remaining as an ugly swelling. Whoever is bothered by this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast as shown in this shape.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~:. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with a healing medicine, then sew together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If the breast sags downward and droops from its bone as often happens to women.
It is advisable to make two incisions in its upper sides, resembling a crescent shape, each connecting with the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as follows:. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then remove the skin between the two incisions, remove the fat, and use the suturing and dressings, as well as any other treatment needed until it heals.
If it does not accommodate the cutting of what should be cut due to the patient's anxiety or excessive bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in a caustic ointment and leave it until the remaining fat is dissolved, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On the treatment of tumors that occur under the armpit.
These tumors that occur under the armpit are of a pig-like type, solid and enclosed in a sac. Some of them contain moisture; those that do should be incised in a crescent shape as follows:.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~, once you have expelled all the contents of the tumor, pack it with old cotton and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton.
It is treated with an ointment suitable for that until it heals. If the swelling is of the type known as "pigs' nodes," then incise it as we have mentioned in the section on incising pigs equally. If the wound persists and pus spreads, cauterize it as described previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On incising a swelling that appears near an artery or vein, which is called aneurysm.
If an artery is cut and the skin above it heals, a swelling often appears. Similarly, a vein may also become distended and swollen.
The signs to identify whether a swelling and distension are from an artery or a vein: if the swelling is from an artery, it will be elongated and concentrated deep within the body. If you press the swelling with your finger, you will feel a grating sensation.
A swelling from a vein will be round and on the surface of the body. Incising these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, elbow joint, neck, and many other parts of the body that are very large; therefore, it should be avoided to treat them with iron instruments.
Those that occur in the limbs or head should also be avoided. If it is an arterial swelling, make a long incision in the skin over it, then widen the incision with forceps, then peel back the artery and free it from the fascia.
Continue until it is exposed, then insert a needle and pass it to the other side. Clamp the artery with a doubly folded suture at two points as explained when ligating the arteries in the temples. Then cut between the ligatures to allow all the blood to flow out.
The tumor is then dissolved, and the treatment that produces pus is used until the ligaments fall off, then it is treated with ointments appropriate for this condition until it heals.
If the tumor is due to a vein rupture, you should grasp as much of the tumor and skin as possible with your hand, then insert a needle below where you are holding it and pass it through so that it comes out the other side with a doubled thread. Then securely tie the tumor as I have described to you for tying a grape from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
Tighten your threads in four places, then cut open the tumor in the middle until what is inside comes out, and then cut off the excess skin but leave what was tied. Then place a dressing on it that has been soaked in syrup and oil. Then use the treatment involving bandages and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that results from nerve strain.
Just as a tumor can occur in an artery or vein, so too can a tumor occur in a nerve if it is struck or due to excessive fatigue or similar causes, and this happens more often at the wrists and heels.
In every place where a joint moves, there can be a wandering tumor that is the same color as the rest of the body. It is usually painless, but if pressed firmly, the patient feels a numbness-like sensation. The tumor does not gather deeply within the body.
It may be beneath the skin and moves in every direction, neither going forward nor backward. What is found in the joints should not be approached with iron, for it might cause damage. What is found in the head or on the forehead.
Incise the skin with a scalpel; if the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at its base. If it is large, suspend it with a clamp, peel it away, then remove it and suture the wound, treating it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cutting Warts That Appear on the Abdomen.
Warts resembling mushrooms often appear on people's abdomens and other parts of their bodies. They are called fungal warts because they resemble mushrooms; their base is thin, while their head is thick. Their edges may become rough, and among them are small ones as well as those that grow very large.
I once saw a man with two warts on his abdomen that most resembled mushrooms, white and thin at the base, with rough edges that had cracked, and moisture always seeping from them. I cut them out; one weighed about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
In cutting such warts, observe the patient. If the patient is moist and the wart is white, soft, and thin at the base, cut it with a broad scalpel. Have cautery irons ready in the fire because often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding becomes too severe, cauterize it immediately. If you see that the patient is timid and frightened by cutting with iron, take a thick lead wire and tie it around the wart of this description, leaving it for two days. Then tighten the lead wire further until the wart is removed.
Whenever it affects the tumors so that they separate and fall off by themselves without effort, then if the tumor has a thick base, there is some fear and danger in cutting it, especially those in the abdomen; but it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a tumor that is pale in color, has little sensation, and is unsightly, for it is a cancerous swelling. We will come to mention cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the Treatment of Umbilical Polyps.
Umbilical polyps have many causes: either from the rupture of the abdominal peritoneum, through which fat or intestine protrudes as in other hernias; or from blood that emanates from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from gas that accumulates within it.
If it is due to the rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of fat, then the color of the swelling will resemble the color of the body, it will be soft without pain, and its position will vary. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be even more varied as we described. When you press it with your fingers, it withdraws and then returns, and there may be a gurgling sound; it also becomes much larger when entering a bath or experiencing severe fatigue. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It will not retreat if you press it with your hand, nor will it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, the swelling will appear black along with these signs. If it is due to newly grown flesh, the swelling will be hard and stationary at a constant size.
If it is above the navel, its touch will be soft. The procedure in this case is to examine; if you find that the umbilicus protrudes due to blood from an artery or vein or above the navel, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is fear and danger involved as I informed you about in the chapter where I mentioned tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestine or fat, then you should order the patient to restrain themselves and stand erect. Then apply medication around the entire umbilicus. Then order him to lie down in front of you on his back. Then use a broad scalpel around the umbilicus at the place where you applied the medication. Then elevate the center of the swelling upwards with a large lancet, then tie tightly the area that was cut with strong thread or silk.
The knot of the ligature should be made loose. Then open the center of the constricted swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger to find the intestine. If you find that the ligature has caught it, loosen the knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, elevate it with a lancet.
Cut away the excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligature it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads. Insert these needles into the incision made around the swelling, crossing them, then tie the swelling in four places with the needles.
If you prefer, remove the needles and leave the area so that the constricted flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it when it becomes soft and rotten. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is composed of new growth tissue.
And if it is due to moisture, you should incise the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or moisture that you find there, then treat it with something that will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat them with drugs, and warned against treating them with iron so that they do not ulcerate. We also discussed cancer originating in the uterus and warned about its treatment.
I mentioned that the ancients said: Whenever cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or thigh and similar organs that allow its complete extraction, especially if it is recent and small. However, if it has spread widely and become large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen before me anyone who has reached that goal. If the cancer is in a place where we can work on it as I have said, one should begin by administering black hellebore repeatedly until the patient is weakened, then if it is in the veins and there is obvious swelling, proceed to dislodge it.
Then place the patient in a position where they can endure the procedure, and apply treatments suitable for the cancer. Incise it thoroughly from all sides along with the skin until none of its roots remain, and allow the blood to flow without cutting it too quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and let all the thick blood flow by hand or with whatever tools are available. If excessive bleeding occurs during the procedure from cutting an artery or vein, apply a tourniquet until the bleeding stops, then continue treatment with other remedies until recovery.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the Treatment of Hernias.
In the classification, we have described the types of hydrothorax, how the accumulation of water occurs, the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines. The type that is treated with iron is only the zaki (strange or unusual) type; the tabbi (congenital) type and the lahmia (fleshy) type are never treated with iron at all.
If that is the case, it is combat, if you have treated this type of hernia (the zaki type) with medicines and your treatment has not been effective. Then look to see if the patient has become excessively weak or if he suffers from another disease in addition to the hernia, such as.
cough or diarrhea and the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, without any illness other than the hernia alone, and he is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the approach to treatment should be to have the patient stand in front of you. And have a servant stand behind him to press his abdomen with his hands and push the water downward towards the groin. Then take a spiked instrument in this manner:.
Long and defined on both sides like a scalpel, but with slightly curved ends so that it does not accidentally penetrate the intestine during the procedure and cause harm. Then observe if the hernia has developed from the intestinal side.
It is advisable to make an incision three fingerbreadths below the navel, above the groin. If the hernia has developed due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingerbreadths to the left of the navel. If it has developed due to spleen disease, then the incision should be three fingerbreadths in the right side.
Also, the incision should not be made on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down so that the effluvia do not flow to that weak area; then pierce the skin with the instrument completely and insert the instrument into this incision and raise your hand.
With the scalpel, between the skin and the subcutaneous tissue, as if you were peeling it; the amount you peel should be the size of a fingernail or so. Then puncture the serous layer until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the fluid is, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument whose image is shown here.
It is similar to a tube made from thin cane, which can be made of silver or copper or smooth polished spade metal, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on another side as you see.
And he may sharpen one end of it like the nib of a pen, as shown in this image.
There is a ring at the top end. When the instrument reaches the fluid, it will immediately flow onto the instrument; thus, an appropriate amount of fluid should be drained over time. If too much fluid is drained too quickly, the patient may die due to the dissolution of their vital spirit.
Or the patient may experience a coma that is close to death. However, drain from it according to their strength and what the condition of the patient indicates, such as the strength of their pulse and the quality of their color. Then remove the instrument and stop draining the fluid, for it will immediately be retained.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the serous layer which you were instructed to cover as described, then reintroduce the instrument another day if you see the patient capable of enduring it.
Also, a small amount of water is removed. You should do this for several days while keeping the patient's neck restrained and being careful not to make a mistake so that only a little water remains. If you are concerned about the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat it by burying it in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, keeping him thirsty, and treating him with dried medicines until he recovers, and cauterizing the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described above.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In the treatment of children who are born with the urinary passage unopened, or if the opening is narrow or in an improper position.
Some boys are born with their urethra not perforated, so it is necessary to immediately pierce it as soon as they are born.
With a very thin scalpel, as shown in this illustration:.
Then place a thin lead pin in the hole and secure it for three or four days. When urination is desired, move it aside, then put it back afterward. If you do not use the lead, it may be that the urine passing through the area does not allow it to close up.
As for those whose urethral opening is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we said for many days until it widens. Those whose urethra is in an improper position, such as being at the end of the penis where urination forward is not possible.
Until he raises the urethra with his hand upward, and it should not emerge before semen cannot reach the uterus properly, for this is a very ugly cause, and the purpose of the work in this is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his penis with your left hand strongly, and trim the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like the shape of a fountain pen or as if you are carving something to make it protruding like a ball so that the hole is in the center as required.
Be careful during the procedure to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs. Counteract it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Regarding the abscess that occurs in the tunica vaginalis, the testis, the spermatic cord, and adhesions between the tunica vaginalis and the testis.
This type of abscess often occurs in the urethra; it is a fleshy, dark-colored growth and can be either benign or malignant. For the non-malignant one, it should be attached with a delicate fishhook.
Cut it until you remove it completely, then apply a cotton pad soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it afterward with palm ointment until it heals. If the abscess is malignant and dark-colored, you should use cauterization after cutting and cleaning it.
If the abscess is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person and part of it is inside the foreskin while another part is outside, you should remove the portion of the abscess that is inside first until it heals, then treat the external part.
For when you treat them together, you cannot be sure that the bladder will not rupture. Additionally, there may also be blackening and corruption in the testicles and in the bladder; therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that has turned black or is about to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with ground and sieved rind of pomegranate and chrysanthemum. Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery as shown in this figure:.
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the bladder completely deteriorates at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the bladder to the testicles:
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and has not undergone circumcision. It may also occur due to a wound or swelling, so it is necessary to dissect it with a thin scalpel until the ligament loosens and the testicle is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them during examination, it is necessary to dissect a part of the testicle and foreskin. Since the foreskin is thin, it may easily rupture due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and testicle with a thin piece of linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere to each other as well.
Then treat it with a constricting decoction until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven
On cleansing children and treating what befalls them from defects.
Circumcision is nothing else but a separation of the connection, as in other operations done according to our will and intention. However, since it is an act performed by us through our own volition and its application especially to children, it is necessary for us to establish the best method for performing it.
The easiest and safest method, I say that the early writers did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their customs; rather, we have acquired this practice.
By experience, I found that the majority of practitioners and barbers use a scalpel or scissors for cleansing, and they use ligatures with thread and cutting with fingernails. I have tried all these methods.
I did not find any method better than cleansing with scissors and using thread for ligatures, because cleansing with a scalpel often leads to complications. This is because the foreskin consists of two layers; it may happen that the upper layer is cut while the lower layer remains intact.
This would require another cut and renewed pain. As for cleansing with a ligature, it does not guarantee that the tip of the urethra will not be cut since it may enter its opening. Furthermore, cleansing by cutting with fingernails might cause the foreskin to slip or your work to go wrong, or perhaps the child's foreskin is naturally short.
Many are born this way and do not need cleansing, and I have seen that. As for cleansing with scissors and using thread for ligatures, experience has shown me its advantages because the scissors make even cuts since both blades above and below are sharp.
When you press your hand with the two blades in proper alignment, you will make a single incision at once without any error whatsoever. The first step is to prepare the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little, tell him that you will tie the thread in his urethra only and leave it for another day, then cheer him up and please him in every way possible to make him accept it with his mind, then have him stand before you straight.
He must not sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy's eyes do not fall on them at all nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his urethra and blow into the skin and lift it up until the tip of the urethra comes out.
Then clean it from whatever dirt has accumulated. Then tie the marked place with a folded thread, then tie another knot slightly below it. Hold firmly with your thumb and index finger the lower part of this second knot, then cut between the two knots. Then lift the skin quickly and pull out the tip of the urethra, then let a little blood flow as it is better and less likely to cause swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with ashes of dried gourd or flour of lupine, both are excellent treatments.
Then lift the skin quickly and pull out the tip of the urethra, then let a little blood flow as it is better and less likely to cause swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a wet cloth, then sprinkle it with ashes of dried gourd or flour of lupine, both are excellent treatments. Then carry him to the bed above and place a piece of cloth with a boiled egg yolk mixed in rose water and beaten with fresh rose oil on him, and leave it there for another day. Then treat him with other remedies until he is healed.
This is an image of scissors suitable for cleansing:.
They should be straight scissors, curved like a nail, and the length of the blades should be equal to the handles. As for the error that may occur during cleansing, it might turn the entire inner skin or part of it inside out when cutting; therefore, you should immediately stretch it with your fingernail before the area becomes swollen.
Cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a needle and cut it. If three days have passed and the area below the urethral opening remains swollen and red, leave it until the inflammation subsides and then gently peel it off.
Cut it as seems appropriate to you, but be cautious near the urethral opening. If you accidentally cut any part of the urethral opening, it is not harmful. Treat it with substances that promote wound healing, as described in the article on dressings.
If you cut more than the required amount of skin and it retracts upwards, this does not cause much harm either. Treat it as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the Treatment of Retained Urine in the Bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or growths and similar conditions. If you treat this with the methods of treatment described in the classification.
If the urine does not pass and you see that its retention is due to a stone damaging the neck of the bladder, then have the patient sit on his knees and lie down, then place one leg over his back while he stretches his abdomen towards his back. The patient should hold himself as much as possible.
At that time, the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone backward so that urine can flow out. If it does not flow out as mentioned and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use a device called catheters, which has this design:.
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half handbreadths in length, with a delicate nozzle at the end. To draw out urine with it, take a folded thread and securely tie wool or cotton to one end.
Insert one end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter and trim any excess wool so that it can enter the tube like a plug. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
Moisten the bladder and urethra with wet ointments or oil and warm water, then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches its base. Then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, and push the catheter further inside.
Once the urethra is bent properly, push the catheter inside until it reaches near the buttocks. Then tilt the penis downward while keeping the catheter inside and continue to push it until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that it has reached an empty space.
It is made this way because the passage through which urine flows has curves. Then pull the thread with the wool tightly for a moment; the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it, and the urine will be released, and you can reuse the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to Inject the Bladder with a Syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube thinner than pus. If you wish to drop water and medicines into it, use an instrument called a syringe, and here is its image:.
It is made of silver or hollowed ivory, with a long tube thinner than a hair. The entire instrument is hollow except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other side as you can see.
The hollow part where the tube is should be just enough to block it without excess, so that when you pull, moisture is drawn in, and when you push, it is expelled, as is done with a device used to throw oil during sea battles.
If you wish to expel fluids from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull with the tube upward; then the fluid will be drawn into the hollow part of the syringe. Next, insert the tip into the urethra as described for catheters, and then push the fluid out with the tube.
The fluid will reach the bladder until the patient can feel it. This is also a delicate syringe used to inject the bladder:.
It is made of silver or spadarius, with its upper part resembling a small funnel and below it a groove where the strap fits. Then take a camel's bladder, place in it the fluid you want to inject into the bladder, and tie it tightly between the grooves with twisted thread.
Warm that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra. Then grasp the bladder with the moistened hand firmly so that the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is not available, take a piece of thin leather and make a circle from it. Pierce it all around, then insert a tight thread through those holes as it turns. Then gather the circle as you would fold a napkin after placing what you want of moisture, oils, or water inside it.
Then tie it to the machine and use it as you did with the bladder by pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Removal of Stones.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medications, and I have described the difference between kidney stones and bladder stones along with the signs indicating each. I also discussed the cases where manual intervention or incision is necessary.
These are the stones that form in the bladder, especially those that obstruct the urethra. I will describe this with a clear and concise explanation.
I say that stones forming in the bladder most often affect children. One of its signs is that urine exiting the bladder is similar to water in thinness.
Rash and itching in the genital area may occur, and it often dangles and spreads. The buttocks may protrude in many cases, and it is easier for children to expel them until they are fourteen years old, while it is difficult for elderly people. For young adults, it is somewhere in between.
And the one whose stones are larger is easier to treat, and the smaller ones are the opposite. When we come to treatment, it is first necessary to administer an enema to evacuate all the feces in his intestines, for this may prevent the detection of the stone during examination.
Then, take the patient by his legs and shake and vibrate him downward to make the stone descend to the neck of the bladder or have him jump from a raised position several times. Then sit him upright before you with his hands under your thighs so that the entire bladder is tilted downwards, then examine him.
Examine him externally; if you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately to make an incision upon it. If it does not come within your reach at all, then smear your index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a child, or your middle finger.
If the patient is a fully grown boy, insert your finger into his rectum and search for the stone until it comes within your reach. Then move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place you intend to incise.
Order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to extend his right hand upwards towards the pubis and his other hand under it, toward the place where the incision will be made. Then take the scalpel, which has this shape:.
Make the incision between the rectum and the pubis, not in the middle but towards the left side. The incision should be directly over the stone, with your finger in the rectum pressing it outward gently so that the external part of the incision is wide and the internal part narrow, allowing the safe passage of the stone.
Do not enlarge it, for the finger pressing on the bladder stone may cause it to come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones with angles and edges which make their removal difficult because of this.
And there are smooth ones resembling acorns and round ones that come out easily. But those with angles and edges should have the incision extended slightly if they do not come out this way. If they still do not come out, it is necessary to devise a method to grasp them, such as using a tightly bound strip whose end is like a blade.
He should grasp the stone firmly so that it does not slip from his hand. Or he may insert a delicate instrument with a curved end under it. If this is not possible, then widen the incision slightly. If bleeding occurs, cut it using cautery.
If there are more than one stone, push the larger one towards the bladder opening first, then make an incision for it. Then push the smaller ones after that. Do this in the same manner if there are more than two stones. If a stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision because it exposes the patient to one of two risks.
Either he may die, or continuous urine leakage may occur because the area will not heal properly. However, try to push it out or devise a way to break it into pieces with forceps so that it can be removed in parts.
When you have finished your work, wash the wound with candy sugar, colocynth, and alum, then apply pressure to it. Place a bandage soaked in oil and syrup or ointment made of rose water, fat, and cold water on top to reduce inflammation. The patient should lie face down, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it dissolves, wash the area with a lot of water and oil, then treat it with the almond ointment and the balsam ointment until it heals. If a hot swelling appears in the wound or if there is clotting like blood clotted in the bladder preventing urination, which can be known by the presence of blood coming out with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type accordingly until it heals.
Throughout the entire treatment period, it is advisable to bind the thighs together and bring them close to stabilize the medicines applied to the area. If the stone is small and becomes lodged in the urethra causing obstruction of urination, treat it with what I will describe before it necessitates cutting.
This treatment often eliminates the need for cutting, as I have tried it and found it effective. It involves taking a fork made of steel, which looks like this: .
The tip is sharp and attached to a stick. Then take a thread and tie it under the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder. Then gently insert the forked iron into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the fork with your hand around the stone little by little, aiming to pierce it until it passes through from the other side. Then urine will flow immediately. Squeeze what remains of the stone from outside the urethra; it will break apart and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not available to you due to an obstacle preventing it, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then make an incision on the stone within the penis between the ties, then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean out any clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The reason for tying a thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above is so that after removing the stone and untying the thread, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin up so that it returns to its place when you are done and covers the wound as we said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On Removing Stones from Women.
Stones rarely form in women. If a stone does occur in one of them, it is difficult to treat due to many reasons. One reason is that the woman may be unmarried, and another is that you cannot find a woman who would allow herself to be examined by a doctor.
If she is chaste or from a family with strict morals, the third reason is that you cannot find a woman skilled in this craft, especially manual work, and the fourth reason is that the location of the incision needed to reach the stone in women is far from where the stone is located, requiring a deep incision.
There is danger in that. If necessity requires it, you should seek a skilled female doctor, but such are rarely found. If one cannot be found, then look for an honest and gentle male doctor or bring in a skilled midwife who has some knowledge of this craft.
Open her and order her to do all that you instruct her regarding the examination of the stone, which is that she should look if the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary to insert a finger into her anus and examine the stone. If she finds it, she should press it under her finger.
At that point, order her to make the incision. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should push the stone from the bladder's mouth downward as far as possible until she reaches the base of the thigh. Then make an incision opposite to half the vulva at the base of the thigh wherever it is most accessible and where she feels the stone.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing under it. The initial incision should be small; then insert a probe into this small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the size of the incision as much as necessary for the stone to be able to come out. Know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small, some large; smooth or rough, long or round, with grooves. Recognize their types to guide you in what you wish to do. If bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle the zaj (a type of clay) powder on the place and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Be sure to prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, as they will assist you in your work. If excessive bleeding overcomes you and you feel by the pulsation of the blood that it comes from a severed artery, place a plug on the spot.
Apply the bandage tightly and leave it as is without returning to it, and do not remove the stone, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound; when the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the area becomes pus-filled, return to your work until you extract the stone.
Chapter Sixty-two.
On incising for hydrocephalus.
Hydrocephalus is the accumulation of moisture in the serous membrane that is white and lies beneath the skin covering the testicle, which is called the scrotum. It may also occur in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
Until it seems like another egg, and it lies between the skin of the testicle and the white serous membrane that we mentioned. This occurs rarely, and this accumulation arises from weakness affecting the urethra, causing this substance to be deposited there. It may also result from a blow to the urethra.
This moisture can have many colors; it may be yellowish, or reddish like blood, or dark blackish, or watery and white, which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized are as follows:
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the white serous membrane that we mentioned, then the swelling will be somewhat elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling will be rounded on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, a person imagines it to be another egg. And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white serous membrane, then it falls under sensation. As for knowing the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose shape was described earlier; whatever comes out after using the probe will determine its nature.
When it comes to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have phlebotomy if it is possible for him and you see his body as full. Then he should lie on his back on something raised slightly, place many cloths underneath him, and then you should sit at his left side.
Order a servant to sit at his right side, extending the patient's penis towards one side of the skin of the testicle and toward the side of the groin area. Then take a wide scalpel and make a longitudinal incision in the skin of the testicle from the middle almost to the pubic region.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicle into two halves, until it reaches the white serous membrane that contains it. Peel it carefully without cutting it, and peel more from the side that adheres to the testicle as much as you can.
Then cover the water-filled serous membrane with a wide dressing and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with forceps, elevate the serous membrane upward without touching the skin containing the testicle, and cut the serous membrane as much as you can either in one piece or in sections.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not cut it completely, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes outside of its skin during your work, after you finish cutting the serous membrane, push it back in and then sew together the edges of the skin of the testicle.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until he recovers. If the egg has been diseased by another illness, it is necessary to ligature the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut off the testicle from the scrotum and remove the egg. Treat him with what has been mentioned.
If the water has accumulated on both sides, then know that they are hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first one, equally if it suits you to do them at once, and then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool that has been soaked in oil or rose fat into the incisions. Cover it externally with another layer of wool that has been soaked in a solution of syrup and oil, spreading it over the testicles and abdominal veins. Place a folded cloth on top, which is called a bandage. And secure it from above with a six-pointed bandage as follows:
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them and stuff them with loose wool as in this example. Make the ends that will be tied with wet cotton or wool. Gather them by pulling into a belt around the waist, and one end is taken to the buttocks and back.
The second end is taken towards the groin, and the two ends are taken to the thighs from below, while the remaining two ends are taken to the calves. Gather all by pulling into a belt around the waist. This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization with iron instead of incision.
This is done by taking a fine scissors-like iron, and while it is hot, use it to incise the skin of the testicle as described until the white serous membrane containing the water becomes visible. Then take another iron like this:
It resembles the Greek eye, then wrap it with that peritoneum and it is heated until all the moisture comes out, then fill the peritoneum with ligatures and peel off the layer containing it with an iron and cut as much as possible until everything is removed and be careful not to touch the egg with fire.
Know that this method is safer, farther from bleeding, and better than cutting. If you encounter a hot swelling or bleeding or any other issue during cutting or cauterizing, you should treat whatever happens according to the appropriate treatment as previously mentioned.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot bear this procedure due to its severity, then let him use a poultice as I will describe, provided that it agrees with what we have presented as evidence.
The discharge is watery; therefore, sit the patient on a high chair, then wrap the swelling at its base with a broad scalpel. Apply the poultice along the length of the body and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain out, then place cotton on the area and secure it.
Leave him to heal the remaining water, then treat him until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during the application of the poultice, it is because the white membrane blocks at the mouth of the wound, preventing the water from coming out.
At that time, you should insert a goose feather or the tool used to extract oil from olives, whose image was previously shown, or increase the opening of the wound slightly.
And know that water may return and gather after six months or so; when it gathers, treat it in the same manner and protect the patient for his days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On incising the fleshly valve and its treatment.
Know that incising this valve is one of the dangerous procedures often leading to death in most cases; therefore, we prefer leaving it untouched for safety and will mention the work related to it and the types of tumors.
I say that many tumors may occur in the parts from which the testicles are composed, and this happens for various reasons, either due to excessive heat condensing into the testicles or due to a blow. The color of the tumor is the same as the flesh, and it does not contain water.
The tumor may be soft, and it might also be hard, colored like mud, with no sensation. It can result from the complexity and swelling of arteries as previously mentioned or from the swelling of veins. If it is due to arterial swelling, this can be recognized by the dispersal of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be done at all. As for the one resulting from vein swelling, nothing disperses when pressed with fingers. This type can be incised upon it and on other flesh as needed.
This involves incising the skin of the scrotum, then lifting the testicle upward and removing it from the white serous membrane. Free the spermatic cord from its vessels, ligate the vessels, and cut the cord after freeing it from all sides around the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to those growing tissues,
It is necessary to remove the egg and cut it open. If adhesion occurs between any part of the serous membranes or between organs, you must free all such adhesions and cut them in a circular manner.
If the growth of flesh occurs in the area of adhesion that is behind, you must cut it all and remove the egg as we have said. Once your work is complete, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and the decoction, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the Treatment of Urinary Retention with Renal Calculus.
Daudiyyah is a twisted tumor, some of its twists resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the ureters and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. The treatment of this condition is closely related to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as the early practitioners did. I say that you should seat the patient on a raised chair, then push down on the ureters, and then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
Have another servant hold it tightly and stretch it severely, then make a deep incision with a broad sharp scalpel along the course of the vessels until they are exposed. Then peel them off from all sides as I mentioned to you in the peeling of arteries in the fascia. Then insert a needle with folded thread into them.
Tie them at the first place where the Daudiyyah has affected and also tie them at the last part. Then make a longitudinal incision in the middle and remove the accumulated turbid and foul humors from within.
Then treat the wound as you would other wounds in which a period is desired to allow the vessels that nourish one of the ovaries to fall away, and there is no harm in this. If the inflammation affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the ovaries along with the vessels so that the ovum does not lack nutrition. Before cutting the vessels, they wither and cannot be used.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
On the Treatment of Intestinal Diarrhea.
This diarrhea occurs from a rupture in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen near the iliac regions of the abdominal quadrants, causing the intestines to protrude through this hernia into one of the ovaries.
This hernia may be due to a tear in the peritoneum or its extension, and these two types can occur from many causes such as a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting heavy objects, and similar actions. If it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, it develops gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is relatively even in depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestines. If it is due to a tear in the peritoneum, it begins with intense pain immediately, and the swelling appears distinct under the skin near the area.
This happens when the intestines protrude and exit through the peritoneum, and sometimes fat may come out with the intestines. This diarrhea is called intestinal and omental, and it can occur with gas. Fecal matter may also flow into the intestines and be trapped there, leading to the danger of death for the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially when pressed. Treating these conditions with iron is dangerous, so you should avoid doing so. The method of work is to order the patient to push the intestines back inside the abdomen if possible.
Then he lies on his back before you, raises his legs, and you stretch the skin near the thigh upwards. Then cut all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise, and insert probes into the edges of the incision as needed to open it.
The incision should be as large as necessary to allow the egg to come out. Then peel back the layers of fascia underneath the scrotal skin until you expose the tough white fascia on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger near the egg.
Between the white fascia under the egg's skin and the second layer, release any adhesions behind the egg. With your right hand, bend it inside the scrotal skin, and with your left hand, lift the white fascia upwards along with the egg toward the incision.
Order the servant to lift the egg upwards, and you completely release any adhesions behind it. Check with your finger to ensure there is nothing from the twisted intestine stuck in the tough white fascia. If you find anything, push it towards the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the fascia under the scrotal skin near the incision. Then cut the ends of the thread so that you have four strands. Then some of them are placed on top of each other in a rigid manner and are tied to the mesentery, which we said is under the skin of the testicle, tightly from two sides; then the ends of the threads are also folded and tied very tightly so that none of the vessels that nourish it can reach it. To prevent inflammation and heat, another tie is also made outside the first tie, at a distance of less than two fingers' width; and after these ties, leave from the mesentery under the skin of the testicle the width of a bone.
To prevent inflammation and heat, another tie is also made outside the first tie, at a distance of less than two fingers' width; and after these ties, leave from the mesentery under the skin of the testicle the width of a bone. The rest is cut all around, and with it the testicle is removed; then the bottom of the skin of the testicle is slit so that blood and pus flow out as we described previously. Then, wool soaked in oil is applied to the wound, and the tie we have described is used.
The white mesentery, after it is cut, may be cauterized to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs. The tie should be left in place until it falls off by itself; if it does not fall off quickly, it can be removed with hot water and something that promotes sweating until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments used for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
Regarding these hernias, I have not seen anyone dare to treat them with iron. As mentioned earlier, they should be treated as described for hernias associated with a femoral ring: after the incision, tie off the vessels gently below.
Then cut it in the middle and treat the tumor by opening it until the vessels fall off, and treat the wound as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
On hernias that occur in the armpit.
A hernia may occur in the armpit as we said; it confines itself to the location and does not descend to the groin with any part of the intestine, even if it does, the descent is slight and it returns at all times.
However, if time passes and it persists, the peritoneum tear increases until the intestine and fat descend into the scrotum, which occurs due to the extension of the peritoneal sac that is in the armpit area as we have mentioned. This happens because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and contracts, confining the area. Its treatment is by cauterization as I have previously described.
It can also be treated with an iron implement in this manner: The patient lies on their back before you, then make a transverse incision at the swollen protruding site to the width of three fingers, then cut through the peritoneum layers beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum is exposed, then take a strip and place it on the protruding area of the peritoneum, press it into the depth of the abdomen, then suture both protruding ends to each end of the strip, attaching them together with stitches.
Then pull one end of the strip without cutting the peritoneum at all, and do not touch the testicle or anything else as I have taught you in treating intestinal fistulas. Then treat it as you would other wounds.
When the stitches are removed, clean them and repair the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and does not increase in size at the site of the hernia.
Cauterization is better in this case because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the skin around the testicles.
The skin around the testicles often becomes loose in some people, even though the underlying flesh does not loosen, making the appearance unattractive. Therefore, one who wishes to treat this condition should have the patient lie down on their back and fall asleep.
Cut away all the loose skin on the thick skin, then bring the edges together. If you prefer to sew first, stitch the excess loose skin with three or four stitches securely, and then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On Castration.
Castration is prohibited in our Shariah (Islamic law).
For this reason, it should have been appropriate for me not to mention it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that the physician knows what to do if asked about it and how to treat those affected by it; the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Like rams, goats, and cats, and the like among animals. I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting and dividing. The method of crushing is performed by sitting the animal in hot water until its scrotum relaxes, softens, and hangs down.
Then crush it with your hand until it dissolves and cannot be felt upon touching. As for castration by cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze its scrotal skin with your left hand, then tie off the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Once the testicles protrude, cut them after peeling them, leaving nothing of the mesentery except for the thin layer that covers the vessels. This method of castration is better than the one done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave some of the scrotum, making the animal desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of Hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One type is that an appearance resembling a female vagina, with hair, becomes visible behind the space or on the skin of the testicles between the scrotum, and urine may flow from it.
As for women, there is only one type, which appears above the vagina on the pubic region like those of young males, with one protruding as if it were a male penis and both resembling female genitalia. The treatment for the three types.
Two types of men and one type of women should have the excess flesh cut so that its mark is removed, then treat it as other wounds until it heals. As for the second type of men from whom urine comes out of the sheath covering the testicles, there is no treatment for them at all.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the Cutting of the Clitoris and Excess Flesh from the Female Genitalia.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond what is natural, becoming prominent and ugly to look at. In some women, it can grow large enough to spread like that of men, affecting intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the excess part of the clitoris with your hand or a clamp and cut it, but do not be excessive in cutting, especially near the base to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals. As for the excess flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it up.
And it may protrude outward like a tail. And thus some early physicians called this condition the tail disease; it should be cut as one would cut the clitoris, and then treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the Treatment of Hernias.
Hernia is when a woman's genital area is not pierced or the opening is small. It can be either natural since birth or acquired later. The acquired type may result from a condition previously mentioned, and it can be due to excess fleshy growth.
Or it is thin or thick, and it may be in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or at the top or bottom. It prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation. This is known by the midwife's observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is made of thin membrane and is near the labia, proceed to puncture it by placing something resembling a protective shield on the labia, then place your thumbs together.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs spread wide, then forcefully pull apart the labia to puncture the thin membrane and open the obstruction. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should be joined each day to prevent the area from sealing up again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then it should be cut with a broad blade resembling an oak leaf. If the obstruction is made of protruding flesh, lift it with forceps and cut it. Have medicines on hand that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as cyperi rhizoma, cicuta, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube to prevent the wound from healing too quickly, keep it in place for days. Use a dry linen wick, then treat with other remedies for adhesion until healed. Another growth of flesh may occur in the uterus, which should be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor in the uterus must never be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pimples that appear in the female genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, it is the swelling of the veins until they bleed profusely and continuously. When hemorrhoids advance, they become warts; I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and I will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated from among them: I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep inside the uterus and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment for them with iron. As for those that occur at the mouth of the uterus and are felt by the senses, these are the ones that can be treated.
It is necessary for the woman to enter a cool room, then extend the warts with a comb or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then apply one of the bleeding-stopping dressings when the blood is flowing, without cauterization.
Such as camphor, benzoin, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then let them down into cold water. If bleeding persists, sit her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, flax, and the like. Then take ground barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it as a dressing on her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise continue with firm but gentle pressure on the lumbar region and breasts without any specific condition. Then take a piece of wool and dip it in the juice of rue or the juice of ox-tongue or the juice of mistletoe branches with flax decoction, and keep it applied to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of ulcers in appearance and is rough; therefore, cut what appears from it as mentioned in the treatment of warts, alike, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the underside of the abscess that occurs in the uterus.
There are many types of tumors that can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, polyps, corrosive diseases, fistulas, hemorrhoids, splits, warts, and hot tumors. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that accumulate over time, how its underside should be treated with iron. You must observe whether the pain of the tumor at its onset is acute, accompanied by throbbing and inflammation and fever.
If you see it red and it reacts to touch, do not rush to treat its underside; instead, treat it with what aids maturity until these symptoms subside. At that time, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back against it.
She should draw her legs toward the lower part of her abdomen, spread her thighs apart, place her arms under her knees, and secure them with a suitable band.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument used to open the mouth of the uterus, whose image will come later. If you wish to use this instrument, estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters with the instrument does not exceed its depth.
If the instrument causes pain to the patient, and if it is longer than necessary for the depth, then padding should be placed on the edge of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering too deeply into the uterus. It is also advisable that the loop which runs through the instrument comes from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant should turn the loop until the cervix is dilated. When the abscess becomes visible and can be touched by hand, and if it feels soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a broad knife once all of the pus has been evacuated.
It is advisable to place a soft candlewick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent properties into the wound, and let part of the candlewick remain outside the incision at the cervix. Clean wool soaked in water that has been boiled with hyssop should be applied externally on the uterus and the pubis.
Then treat it with an ointment suitable for this purpose after two days until it heals.
The uterus and the wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, then with water that has been boiled with the root of sarsaparilla or long spurge. Then return to using the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is advisable to refrain from treating it with iron and treat it as mentioned in the division.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an abnormal position.
The midwife should first know the form of normal delivery; among its signs is if you see the woman straining downward and desiring to breathe fresh air, and what she endures of labor pains becomes easier for her.
The delivery of the fetus is hastened; know that this delivery occurs in a normal manner, and the baby will emerge headfirst, with the placenta following or hanging from its navel. When you see these signs, it is advisable to massage her abdomen to hasten the emergence of the fetus.
If it descends headfirst, the placenta will descend with it and will be cleaned thoroughly. Any delivery other than this is unnatural and undesirable, as the fetus may emerge feet-first or with its hands emerging before its head and legs.
One of its hands or one of its feet may emerge first, or the head and one hand together, or it may emerge folded up, or it might flip over onto its back, and other such undesirable forms. It is essential for the midwife to be skilled and delicate in handling all these situations and to be cautious to avoid mistakes and errors.
I will explain each form and how to handle it so that you can understand and act accordingly. When the fetus emerges headfirst in a normal delivery but the labor becomes difficult for the woman, and you see her strength weakening, seat her on a chair and have women assist in supporting her.
Pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist fats, then the midwife should insert a small scissors between her fingers and cut through the placenta with it or use her fingernail to make an incision so that the moisture within it flows out. Massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not come out, you should administer to the woman a concoction of fenugreek saliva mixed with sesame oil. Then after administering this, instruct her to sneeze using cedar and hold her mouth and nose; then the fetus will come out immediately. If the baby's hand comes out first, gently guide them back little by little.
If it does not succeed in entering, place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on to prevent falling. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; it will come out. If the fetus comes out on its feet, you should push its legs up, then gradually turn the fetus little by little until it is aligned, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
When they come out to the thighs, instruct her to sneeze using cedar; it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then gently guide the fetus back little by little until it is in the natural position; it will then come out smoothly. If it resists all of what has been described.
Take fenugreek saliva, onion juice, sesame oil, and dissolved gum, then mix all of it in a mortar thoroughly. Then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen, then have her sit in warm water until it reaches her pubic area.
When you see that her lower part has softened, prepare a douche of myrrh for her to bear. When she holds the douche for a moment, have her sit on the chair and then make her sneeze while holding her mouth and nose closed, gently press her lower abdomen; then the fetus will come out immediately, coming out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, then gradually insert your hands little by little. Then the woman should lie on her back and let her heels hang down while lying on a bed, and she should clasp her hands together. Then squeeze over her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her feet so that she is raised up. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs and move them vigorously. Then squeeze above the buttocks little by little until the fetus rises up. Then the midwife should insert her hand and adjust the fetus little by little.
Instruct the woman to strain until the fetus is born. If the birth of the fetus is obstructed and hanging with one of its hands, try to push back the hand. If you cannot push it back, then have the woman stand up and walk. If she cannot walk, then have her lie down.
Have her lie on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice I described made from saliva. If she goes into labor, have her sit on a chair and then work on pushing back the hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural position. Make her sneeze and instruct her to strain until it comes out.
If the fetus is born lying on its back with its arms extended and its face towards its mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's hand and gradually turn it gently. Once it is properly positioned, apply the ointment and saliva preparations as described.
Then instruct her to move little by little. Once she does that, have her sit on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side. Then instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with the hand (kenedis). The fetus is born lying on its side in an upright position.
When it descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until you remove the moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel so that he does not suffocate and die. Then push the fetus inside until it is as it should be.
Instruct the woman to squat several times, for it will come out easily, like twins or many fetuses. Know that twins often are born and can survive; three or four may also be born and live, but this is rare. As for five, it is outside nature and they cannot live at all.
They are enclosed by one placenta, even if they are many, and are separated by a membrane that is attached to the navel of each one. They may come out as a single fetus does, naturally and easily, or they may emerge in a problematic manner as described.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and take on the abnormal forms we have mentioned, treat them as described. Let the midwife be gentle and act with care and deliberation, employing whatever means come to hand that lead to safety.
Describe what can be conceived in the uterus and then miscarried. It may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten. I have confirmed that a woman once miscarried seven, and another miscarried fifteen, all of which were conceived together.
By the decree of the Almighty, All-Knowing, all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for she may one day encounter something like it and must deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
في إخراج الجنين الميت.
إذا عالجت الجنين الميتكما ذكرته في التقسيم من العلاج فلم يخرج واضطررت إلى العمل باليد، فينبغي أن تنظر: فإن كانت المرأة صحية القوة وليس بها شيء من الأعراض التي تخاف عليها منها التلف، فينبغي أن تستلقى المرأة على سرير على ظهرها.
ويبسملكون رأسها مائلة إلى أسفل وساقيها مرتفعتين، وخادم يضبطها من كلتي الجهتين أو تربط إلى السرير لئلا ينجذب جسدها عند مد الجنين.
ثم يرطب فم رحمها بالأدهان الرطبة مع لعاب الخطمي والحلبة وبزر الكتان، ثم تدهن القابلة يدها بهذه الأدهان واللعابات، ثم تدخلها في الرحم برفق، ثم تطلب بها مكانا تغرز فيه الصنارات من الجنين، والمواضع الموافقة لذلك،.
انظر فإن كان الجنين متأتيا أن ينزل على رأسه، فتغرز الصنارات في عينيه أو في قفاه أو في فمه أو في حنكه أو تحت لحيته أو ترقوته أو في المواضع القريبة من الأضلاع أو تحت الشراسيف.
وأمّا إن كان نزوله على رجليه، ففي العانة والأضلاع الوسطى. ويجب أن تمسك الصنارة باليد اليمنى وتصير عطفها فيما بين أصابع اليد اليسرى وتدخل اليد برفق وتغرز صنارة في بعض تلك المواضع التي ذكرنا.
Until you reach an empty space, then pierce another hook opposite it or a third one if needed for equal traction and no tilting in any direction; then pull evenly, not only straight but also moving to every side.
To ease its emergence, as is done with a tooth when extracting it. It is advisable in this interval to loosen the traction; if it gets stuck in one direction, then some fingers should be greased and inserted to turn what has become fixed. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other positions.
It is slightly higher; do this until the entire fetus has emerged. If one hand emerges before the others and cannot be returned due to compression, then wrap a cloth around it and pull it out until it is all out, then cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and so forth; you should do this with the other hand and with both legs. If the baby's head is large and faces difficulty in coming out or if there is water collected in its head, then you should insert between the fingers a hooked instrument.
Cut with it to release the water, or use an instrument called a mishaqah to crack the head; the image of this tool along with other instruments will be shown in the section that follows this one.
Do the same if the fetus has a naturally large head; you should cut the skull or crack it with the mishaqah as we have said, then remove the bones with pincers. If the head emerges and gets stuck at the clavicle, then make an incision to allow the moisture in the chest to drain.
If the chest does not close properly, then if it cannot be closed and there is no possibility of exiting, cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a hernia, it is necessary to incise it so that the moisture may drain out.
If the fetus is positioned with its feet down, then pulling it out is easy and aligning it to the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is compressed in the abdomen or chest, you must pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside can flow out.
If you have removed all the other organs and the head is retained and obstructed, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and locate the head with it, then pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a crochet or two crochets and pull it out with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling, you should not force it but instead use methods such as pouring moist, fatty substances, apply poultices, and sit in water that relaxes and moisturizes.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if it can be adjusted, use what we mentioned for a living fetus. If that cannot be done, cut it in pieces and remove it, and you must not leave any part of the placenta inside at all. Once you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned for treating hot swellings that occur in the womb.
If bleeding occurs, then let her descend into binding waters and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who had been pregnant, the fetus died inside her, and she became pregnant with it again.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time, a tumor appeared in her groin area and it swelled until it burst, and pus began to discharge. She was called for treatment, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal properly, so I applied some very strong drawing ointment to it.
A bone then came out from the area, and after some days another bone came out. I was amazed at this because there are no bones in that part of the body, so I assumed they were from the dead fetus. I examined the wound carefully and removed many bones, which were parts of the skull of the fetus.
I continued this process until I removed many bones, and the woman was in better health. She lived like this for some time, with pus still coming out of the wound. This is why I have mentioned this case here as an unusual example.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve through treatment with his hands.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
Concerning the illustrations of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
An illustration of a dilator used to open the mouth of the uterus:
This is a clamps which evens out books; it has dilators at the ends of the two pieces of wood. However, this dilator should be finer than the clamp and can be made either from ebony or boxwood, with each piece of wood being about two finger breadths in thickness.
The sides are about one finger width apart, and their length is about one and a half handbreadths. In the middle of the two pieces of wood, there are rods made of the same type of wood, securely fastened in them; these rods are about half a handbreadth long or slightly more, with a width of about two fingers or slightly more. These two rods:
These are the two that enter into the mouth of the uterus to open it when you turn the specula; a figure of another instrument for the same purpose, more delicate and lighter:.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, but at its end it has two prongs as you see; each prong is about an inch long and two fingers wide. When you want to open the uterus with them.
Then place the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart. Then insert these two prongs gently into the mouth of the uterus while holding the end of the instrument between your thighs below. Then open the instrument with your hand as you would with forceps, to whatever degree you wish to open the uterus. Until the midwife accomplishes what she wishes; a figure of another speculum mentioned by earlier authors:.
A figure of the instrument used to expel the fetus:.
A figure of the instrument used to dilate the head of the fetus:.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end as you see. It may also be made rectangular like forceps, as in this figure, with teeth like those of a saw to cut and soften:.
A figure of another instrument: (Note: The original Arabic text specifies "a figure of another gun-like instrument," but without context on what "مدفع" means in this specific surgical tool, the translation maintains the specificity indicated.)
A figure of a hook:
This hook is slightly thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it; a figure of a two-pronged hook:.
An illustration of two broad surgical knives for cutting the fetus:.
All these tools, the more varied their types and the better prepared they are when needed by the craftsman, make his work faster and earn him respect for his expertise. Do not underestimate any tool that may be necessary to have at hand..
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
On the Removal of the Afterbirth.
If the afterbirth becomes retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with cane sugar. Hold your hand over her mouth and nostrils; if it comes out this way, otherwise take another approach.
And pierce a hole in the lid, place within it herbs that open the mouth of the womb such as fumitory, savory, celery, chamomile, wormwood, sage, and centaury, either all or some of these medicines. Cover them with water and heat on the fire. Then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot lid, with one end inside the opening of the uterus.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze as we said; the afterbirth will come out quickly. If it remains despite this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in shiraj ointment or the spittle of a young bird.
Then insert her hand into the womb and search for the afterbirth; when she touches it, grasp it and draw it out little by little until it is completely removed. If it is adhered deep within the uterus, insert the hand as described until you find the afterbirth, then pull it out little by little with care.
To prevent the uterus from falling out due to excessive traction, it should rather be moved gently to the sides, right and left. Then the amount of traction can be increased; at that point, it will respond and separate from any adhesions. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing, treating the vessel, and using decoctions.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, beware of using violence in reapplying traction. Instead, tie what has come out to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh and then inject her with the quadrilateral ointment, for it will cause it to contract after several days.
It will dissolve and come out, except that if it contracts, a foul smell will rise to the stomach and head, which will distress the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate smoking treatments.
Therefore, some of the early practitioners tried smoking with charcoal and dry figs. This is an image of the apparatus used to fumigate women in cases of retained menstruation, retained placenta, and similar conditions:.
It is made of lead and resembles a funnel, or it can be made of copper. The narrow end is placed in the front, and the wider end is placed over the fire. Place the incense on the glowing embers and hold it until that incense is gone, then repeat with more.

On the Treatment of Imperforate Anus.
Many boys are born with their anuses not perforated, sealed by a thin membrane. The midwife should puncture this membrane with her finger; if that is not possible, she should cut it with a sharp instrument and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place a wool cloth soaked in the decoction and oil, then treat it with ointments until he is healed. If you fear that it may become obstructed, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
It may also be blocked due to the healing of a wound or a tumor; it is necessary to incise that adhesion and then treat it with the methods mentioned, including treatment and lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids Occurring Below.
Hemorrhoids occurring below are complications and thickening that occur near the anus externally or in the space from one side, and they can be one or more.
If this complication persists, it will open and discharge watery moisture or thin pus. Some of these hemorrhoids may penetrate to the rectum and intestine, while others do not. The penetrating ones can be identified by what is expelled with the stool and gas when the patient defecates.
It may also expel worms. Some of them can be hemorrhoids if they penetrate from the space to the bladder and urethra, or to the hip joint and the coccyx. What distinguishes a hemorrhoid penetrating to the anus from one that does not is also known.
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the hemorrhoid made of copper or iron. If there is no curvature in the hemorrhoid, use it; if there is curvature, insert a thin lead probe or a hair from horsehair into it.
Until you feel the probe or the thread in your finger; if you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole, neither excrement nor smell nor worms as we said, then know that it is not penetrating, so hurry to treat it.
If the polyp is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary passage, its sign is that urine comes out of it and it resists healing with medicines. As for if it is penetrating to the hip joint or to the lower part of the spine, its mark is the probe reaching there.
If it does not have a connection to the bone and there is pain in its vicinity, and pus comes out of it constantly, and no treatment helps and it does not heal with ointment, then none of these penetrating polyps will heal completely.
Treating it is a futile effort for those doctors who try to treat it improperly, whereas the one that is not penetrating and is not chronic can be hoped to heal with iron as I will describe and what I have experienced. This involves laying the patient down in front of you on their back.
He should lift his legs up, with his thighs tilted towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe into the polyp if it has a connection to another part until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the buttocks, then you should insert your index finger into the buttocks.
If you feel the probe has penetrated by itself clearly without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then be certain that it is penetrating. Do not waste effort on it, as it will not heal completely as we have said.
They say that it heals in some people rarely. Among the treatments hoped to be beneficial is to heat a thin iron plate according to the width of the fistula as was mentioned previously and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the rectum, then repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that it has burned all that excess decaying flesh which resembles a bird's quill tube, then treat it with a poultice soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with unguents; if it heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal without this treatment. If you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the rectum, and there is a thick layer of flesh or mesentery between them, and you see that the fistula follows just below the skin's surface, then cut open the skin from the beginning of the fistula at that time. As you proceed along the incision with the probe, which is in the fistula until the incision reaches where the tip of the probe ended, then remove the probe and let it fall out. Then clean that decaying flesh which resembles a bird's quill tube, leaving nothing of it behind.
Then treat it with unguents until it heals. If blood overpowers you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, the best thing to do and the most beneficial is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterizing with fire accomplishes two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And to stop the bleeding and dry the moistures, then treat it with a poultice soaked in fat or ground sulfur in oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out with the pus. Then treat the wound with unguents that promote the healing of solid tissue.
These are medicines that cause contraction and drying; for when they heal, it is a sign of recovery. Do not stuff the hollow tube. If the fistula reaches deep into the rectum but is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the rectum and examine it.
If you feel the probe and there is a membrane or flesh between it and you, and it is close to perforation, then treatment can only be attempted with hope and expectation. One method is to cauterize it as previously mentioned.
Another method is to incise it until you reach the bottom, so that you can insert a thread or apply treatment directly. Do not overdo the incision, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the rectum, causing involuntary defecation. Then treat it as mentioned, and it may heal as we have said.
Another method is to penetrate that membrane and perforate it after incising it close to the rectum, as mentioned, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then carefully remove all the inflamed tissue within the incision as much as possible.
Then proceed to close the entire wound, including the incision and the upper opening, while leaving the fistula open inside the rectum, which will be less burdensome for the patient. The fistula may heal in this manner.
If you insert a probe into the fistula and it is near the surface of the body, alongside the skin and the rectal ring, then take a probe with a perforated tip, like a shoemaker's needle, as shown in this illustration.
Insert a twisted thread made of five threads or so, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its base. If it penetrates along the inner edge of the buttock nearby.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the buttock and pulling out one end of the thread, gather both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two; every time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the threads separates and falls off, then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it as much as possible unless it is deep, in which case you should not do so to avoid cutting through the muscle. Then proceed as described until it heals.
The picture of the scalloped scissors used to incise fistulas shows that one side is very sharp, while the other side is not sharp so as not to cut what does not need cutting, as you can see:.
Chapter Eighty-One.
On Piercing Hemorrhoids that Bleed, Cutting Them, and Treating Fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: they may be inside the rectum, resembling small red grapes or looking like bunches of grapes, and they can be large or small, with blood always oozing from them.
They can be single or multiple, and they can also be outside the rectum at its edges. However, those that are outside the rectum are usually less moist, with yellow fluid or little blood oozing from them continuously, and they match the color of the body.
The treatment for growths inside the rectum is to order the patient to defecate and evacuate until the rectum is exposed, then quickly tie the growths with ligatures or hold them with your fingernail, then cut them at their roots. If the ligatures do not stay due to moisture and laxity,
Scrape it with a coarse cloth or a piece of salted leek, or pull it out with your fingers, then cut it. After cutting, sprinkle some sharp ashes on it to serve as cauterization, or treat it as previously described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the rectum does not respond to evacuation, administer an enema containing a small amount of irritant to cleanse what is inside and facilitate quick exit when the patient evacuates. As for external growths outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and straightforward.
You should grasp it with your fingernail or tie it with a ligature and then cut it. Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals. For those who dislike cutting with iron, you can use the following method: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the growth upwards and pierce it with the needle from the opposite side at its root. Tie the ends of the thread underneath the needle, which is crossing through, and tighten the growth firmly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all the growths, but leave one unthreaded.
To let the excess blood flow out. Then place a cloth soaked in rose ointment or cyriotic on the rectum and have the patient remain still until they fall off. Once the growths have fallen off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
And as for the treatment of fissures, it often occurs from dryness of feces and retention of the natural function. If it persists and medicines do not help, you should strip it with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer that prevents adhesion is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the stripping more vigorously than before until it bleeds and then peel it off; then treat it, for it will recover.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On the Treatment of Retained Sewage Nails and Other Non-Retained Nails, Dry Warts, and Corns.
A nail is a round knot matching the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body but especially in the soles of the feet and the fingertips. It causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail and grasp it with a probe or forceps, then pull it from its base. Then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it as previously described in its section. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, shriveled, round bump on the surface of the body.
They often occur on children's hands. The treatment is to extend the wart and cut it or pierce it with silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a sharp medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument I mentioned for treating corns. A corn is also a small, shriveled, hard bump on the surface of the body that extends deeply inward, and when it is cold, it feels like an ant bite.
It occurs throughout the body, but it is most common in the hands. Its treatment involves taking a tube made from an eagle feather or a strong bird's feather and placing it around the ant until it fits snugly around the tube. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut through what surrounds the ant.
Place it deep into the flesh and remove the ant from its root. If you prefer, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:.
The top of the tube should be smooth and twisted to make it easy for your fingers to grip and twist. If you prefer, you can cauterize the ant as described in the section on treating warts with cauterization.

On the forms of instruments used for injection in treating conditions of diarrhea and colic.
The syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, or copper, either cast or beaten. These instruments are made in different sizes, large and small, depending on their intended use. Those used for treating small children should be smaller, and for those with narrow or painful conditions of the rectum, their syringes should be very delicate. Image of a large syringe:.
The upper nozzle where the tube is attached should be wide, as shown. There is a barrier where the tube is secured, as you can see. The lower end that is inserted into the rectum should be smooth and flat, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the tube or slightly thicker. The bag in which medicines are placed should be made from an animal bladder or sheep's intestine, shaped like a small bowl, with a diameter of one inch.
Make many holes as it rotates, with the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then insert a strong thread made from ten or so strands of linen into these holes and use it to gather the bag like a small bowl. After placing the medicine inside, tightly secure the top of the syringe between the two stones, then inject with it. This is a circular illustration of the bag and the hole:.
The method of using it is to fill the membrane or bladder with medicine that is warm according to the patient's tolerance; be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. Then, the patient lies on his back and lifts his legs up.
Place a cushion or blanket under him, then lubricate the end of the syringe with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or something similar. Then gently insert it into the rectum. The attendant should then hold the bag in both hands and squeeze it vigorously until everything from the syringe is emptied into the intestines.
Then remove the syringe and have the patient raise his legs against the wall. If the medicine prompts a bowel movement, let it happen as much as possible; if he sleeps through the night, it is more beneficial for recovery. If it is used for treating diarrhea and there is a desire to hasten its exit, wait with another injection until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, then let the enema be very gentle and smooth, smoother than the enemas used for children. This is a picture of a delicate enema syringe with its skin stretched over it:.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the Treatment of Surgical injuries.
I have mentioned in the division the treatment of what is similar to cauterizations, and here I will describe their treatment by hand and with drugs in perfect detail. I say that surgical injuries differ according to the substance causing the injury and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The substances causing surgical injuries are many, such as being struck by a stone or cut by a sword or knife, or pierced by a spear, stick, arrow, and other similar objects.
As for surgical injuries according to the body parts affected, they include wounds on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and other such organs.
I will describe the treatment of some injuries to serve as a model and guideline for other injuries. I will begin with simple head wounds, particularly, because compound ones will be mentioned in the first part of Chapter Three of this book.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head without any bone fracture, I examine it. If it is from being struck by a stone or similar and only the skin is cut, but the wound is large and I fear that inflammation may occur, then immediately proceed to suture it with a fine needle. Do not delay this and let blood from him in proportion to his strength if there is no contraindication for letting blood, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is scanty. And let the blood be taken from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Warn the patient against overeating, drinking, and heavy foods. If there is a contraindication for letting blood, reduce his food intake, avoid meat and beverages, and apply cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with the decoction that has astringent properties if a hot swelling occurs on the wound.
If you are safe from a hot swelling, apply his blood if the wound is fresh and has not been altered by exposure to air, using the powder that I will describe to you shortly. If it has been altered by exposure to air, then apply one of the ointments to it.
Until the pus matures, then treat it until he is healed. If the wound is large and it is from a sword cut or something similar, and its edges do not come together with dressing, join them by suturing as I will describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and adheres only slightly to a small depression, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that will form tough flesh instead of skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods that promote firmness such as heads, tails, and similar items.
If the skin becomes gangrenous but does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the affected part and treat it. If there is an artery or vein in these wounds that bleeds and the bleeding cannot be stopped with medicines, then search for the source of the bleeding vessel.
If you succeed in treating it without amputation, do so; but if necessary, amputate it with the knife and ligature it. If dire necessity calls for it and what we have mentioned is of no avail, leave it alone until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and slight, their treatment is easy and simple, sufficient being to sprinkle them with this powder and let them be with their own blood.
Before it changes by the air, the recipe for the powder is as follows: take one part of loban, two parts of shiyan, and three parts of lime, either slaked or unslaked. Crush all ingredients together, sift them, and pack the mixture into the wound tightly so that it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it undisturbed as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not be removed until the wound heals. This can also be done with lime alone if you do not have loban and shiyan available.
This method can also be applied with urine in many large wounds if it is properly placed and tightly bound, especially when the wounds are fresh with their own blood before they change due to air exposure. However, if the wound has undergone some alteration due to air exposure, particularly during summer times.
There is no effective meaning in applying this powder, so treat it as we have described: apply some prepared ointments to it or place a paste made from barley flour mixed with water and honey on it until the pus matures. Then proceed to treat it with the rest of the methods until it heals.
If a fracture occurs in the bone along with the wound and it is slight, pull it with a splint. I have mentioned the treatment of skull fractures in what will be discussed later, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a neck wound and a head wound if they are minor.
And if it is a nerve that has been cut from the neck or an artery, then if it is a nerve there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with things that cause strong contraction such as iron rings and similar items because they harm the nerve and constrict it.
Nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all because the essence of the nerve is cold and it is connected to the brain, which is the noblest organ. What you treat it with should be soft medications like linseed washed in fresh water several times and moistened with oil or rose ointment and myrtle.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other metallic stones in this manner and moist salves. If the wound is large, use stitching or bandage its edges with dressings, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth with a pocket at the bottom where pus collects, treat it by placing a dressing in the lowest part of the wound. If an artery is cut in the wound and bleeding occurs, then ligate it or cauterize it if necessary to stop the bleeding.
If the wound has cut some of the cartilages of the throat or all of them but the veins are intact, then gather the edges of the skin with stitches around the windpipe. Do not touch the throat directly; instead, smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then secure it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a constricting and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are bone fragments in it, remove them all or as much as possible, and leave what cannot be removed until the wound dries up, heals, and becomes easier to extract.
If the wound is suppurating, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone in the wound becomes gangrenous and forms an abscess, treat it as will be mentioned in its section, concerning chest surgery and the area between the shoulders.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see that it has depth, observe if air escapes when the patient breathes; then know that it is a fatal wound. If it does not have depth and is suppurating with blood, do not apply powder immediately or bind it tightly so that the blood does not become trapped in its depths.
It may lead to the heart and kill the patient, but apply a drawing ointment to it and change it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment available, place an old piece of cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb any moisture that comes out, and allow the patient to rest with the wounded area elevated.
Let it drain what accumulates within. If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred and the patient has not experienced convulsions, poor palpitations, difficulty breathing, and you see that all other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe. Treat it with bandaging and other remedies until it heals.
If it is difficult to examine it and the discharge continues constantly, then know that it has become an abscess. Treat it as described in its section. The patient should rest on the wound to allow what accumulates within to drain. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with suturing as previously mentioned.
If it is large, treat it accordingly; if small, treat it with powder. If it has affected the bone and pieces of bone are detached, examine the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are healthy. If they are not healthy, leave them as they are.
If the wound becomes infected, it will be easier to remove [foreign bodies], and as for other wounds occurring in other organs, their treatment is like what we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On wounds of the abdomen and the protrusion of the intestines and their suturing.
A wound that affects the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may allow intestines or several sections of intestine to protrude, making their replacement and suturing more difficult and challenging.
A small wound can also be difficult in another way, making its replacement more challenging. If the intestines are not immediately returned to their proper place, they may swell and become thicker, making them harder to insert. For this reason, a medium-sized wound is considered the best because it does not make the return of the intestines as difficult as it would be with these two types [of wounds].
Know that suturing the abdomen is done in four ways. Two of these methods are general and can be used for suturing the abdomen as well as other wounds on the body. The other two methods are specific but are particularly specialized for suturing the abdomen, although they can also be applied to other types of wounds.
I will describe them one by one with explanation and clarification. So, I say that if the wound is small and part of the intestine protrudes from it, making its return difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because the wound is small as we have said, or because the intestines have swollen due to exposure to cold air.
In such a case, it is necessary to warm the area by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water, which may have been boiled with herbs like thuja, saffron, and barley, and apply it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
This can be done with a drink that has a binding effect, which is better than water alone for dissolving the gas. When you see that the gas has dissolved, moisten the intestines with water in which linseed or baker's herb has been boiled, as this will facilitate its passage with less effort.
If it is impossible to return it after this treatment, then make a small incision in the area using the instrument used for hemorrhoids. The first method is better if it succeeds, and one only resorts to making an incision out of necessity and when other methods have failed. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and limited, while the other side is unlimited. Its fine tip is not as thin as a scalpel but slightly blunt. This instrument resembles a small trocar as you can see. When the incision has widened and the intestine has entered, it should be returned to its natural shape.
If you can determine its specific location, that is best. However, if the incision is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head. If it is located in the upper abdomen, he should have his head and chest raised higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the incision is on one side of the abdomen, always keep the side with the surgery higher than the other side. This should be used for major surgeries as well as moderate ones.
As for minor surgeries, place the patient as you see fit. Then have a trusted assistant hold the incision with both hands and pull its edges apart so that the person performing the suturing can work on it bit by bit.
This is the description of a single stitch, which is that you take one needle or several needles according to the width of the wound, then leave from the edge of the incision the thickness of the little finger and pierce one needle without putting thread in it on both sides of the skin. With the inner edges of the subcutaneous tissue beneath the skin until it exits from that side, having gathered together the edges of the skin and the edges of the subcutaneous tissue, making four layers, then tie with a folded thread around the needle several times from both sides altogether until the two lips of the wound come firmly together.
Then leave the thickness of a finger again and pierce another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with however many needles are needed until the entire wound is done, and let the needles be of medium thickness between coarse and fine.
Because very fine needles quickly cut the flesh, and coarse ones are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness between fine and coarse. Also, the needle should not be inserted close to the edge of the skin.
To prevent the flesh from tearing quickly and the wound from opening before healing, nor should it be too far apart in stitching to prevent the wound from closing. Then cut the ends of the needles so they do not injure the patient during sleep, and make bandages of cotton fabric on all sides to hold the ends of the stitches.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds because they may be sufficient with one or two needles or something like that.
As for the method of suturing for the common person, it is to gather together the four edges, namely the edges of the skin and the edges of the serosa at once with a needle that has twisted but moderate thread in thinness and thickness. Then when you have passed through these four edges with the needle, return the needle from the side where you started.
Let the thread interlock from the top of the wound so that the suturing is like the bag suture used to tie up goods, and place between each stitch a space as thick as the smallest finger. This type of suturing is known by all people.
With this suturing method, a surgery was performed on a man who had been wounded in his abdomen with a knife. The surgical incision was more than an inch wide, and about two inches of the middle intestine had come out of it. The wound was located in the center of the abdomen.
He returned the intestines to their place outside the wound after twenty-four hours, and the wound healed in about fifteen days. I treated him until he recovered and lived many years thereafter, managing all aspects of his life. The doctors had previously judged that he would never recover at all.
It is remarkable that I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where there were no medicines at all. I would place old cotton on the wound twice a day and wash it with honey water until he recovered.
As for one of the two types of specialized suturing, I will mention it according to Galen's own words, which are: Begin the suturing from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When you have passed the needle through the skin and the muscle running straight along the entire length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the serous membrane on one side where the needle was inserted, and then passed the needle through its opposite edge from inside to outside on the other side of the cavity. When you have done this, pass it again in this same edge from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the serous membrane on this side and pass the needle through its opposite edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through the serous membrane, extend it to the edge of the cavity on that side until it passes through all of it.
Then begin again from this side and mark it with the edge of the serous membrane on the opposite side, then pull out the needle from the skin nearby, then insert it back into that skin and mark the edge of the serous membrane on the opposite side along with this edge of the cavity.
Then pull it out from the skin on that side, and do this again once more, repeating it time after time until you suture the entire surgery in this manner. The summary of this stitching is to sew like sewing pelts for fur.
Suture the serous membrane once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of specialized suturing mentioned by Galen as well, here is his text verbatim.
It is to suture it as some practitioners do, by gathering each part to its corresponding part that matches it naturally. They join the edge of the serous membrane to its opposite edge and the edge of the cavity to its opposite edge, which will be as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle along the edge of the pleura nearest to you from the outside and pass it inside alone, leaving the edges of the omentum untouched. Then withdraw the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside through both edges of the omentum, then withdraw it again.
Pass it from inside to outside along the edge of the pleura on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than simple, easy stitching, which was mentioned earlier. This is Galen's statement verbatim. Some have said that abdominal stitching can be done with two needles. You should thread them with a single thread and start by inserting the needle from your side to the other side, then insert the other needle from the opposite side back to your side, as in stitching the peritoneum, alike.
Know that if the wound is in the center of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than wounds in other parts of the abdomen. As for treating the wound, it follows the same rules as other wounds. When you encounter a fresh wound filled with blood before the air has changed it, return the intestines and stitch it carefully, then apply crushed hemostatic herbs to it.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some ointment that you have at hand until it becomes pus-filled and the stitches fall out and the omentum and pleura adhere. Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines available, use old cotton as soon as it begins to pus and change it twice a day as I taught you until it heals. In most cases, you will not need further treatment if the wounds are minor. If you fear that the wound may involve pain for major organs,
It is advisable to dip soft wool in moderately heated oil or rose ointment and place it around the areas between the armpits and the ribcage. If he feels pain or foulness in his intestines, this often occurs, so administer a mild black decoction enema to him.
In particular, if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a perforating wound into his abdomen. Know that what is thick in the intestines heals more easily, whereas what is thin heals with greater difficulty.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not heal at all from a surgical incision due to the abundance and size of its veins, its thinness, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. And if what protrudes from the wound is healthy flesh and you catch it fresh, then return it according to how you would return the intestine, alike.
If a period has passed and it has turned green or black, it is advisable to tie it with thread above the place that has turned black to prevent bleeding, as there are veins and arteries in the flesh. Then cut what is below this ligature.
Make the ends of the thread hang down below the incision, outside it, to make it easy for you to pull and remove it when the flesh falls off and the wound suppurates. This refers to a wound that occurs in the intestine. As for if there is a small perforation in the intestine,
It may be possible for it to heal in some people, because I have seen a person who was pierced in his abdomen by a spear, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and turned into a fistula from which feces and gas were expelled. I treated him on the basis that I did not expect him to heal. I continued to treat him gently until he recovered and the wound healed. When I saw that the wound had healed, I feared that something bad might happen internally to the patient, but nothing of the sort happened at all, and he remained in the best condition. He eats, drinks, has intercourse, and goes to the bath. He is also allowed to engage in activities that serve him. Some experienced practitioners have mentioned that if a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be sutured in this manner.
This involves taking large-headed ants, then bringing the edges of the wound together and placing one of the ants on the lips of the wound with its mouth open. When it grasps onto the wound and closes its mouth, it will bite off its head, thus sealing the area without loosening, and then another ant is placed near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then return it and suture the wound. Those heads will remain attached in the intestines until they heal and recover without causing any harm to the patient at all. It is also possible to sew the intestines with fine thread.
To take the thread from the spool of the adhesive animal material after it has been placed on a needle, take one end of this thread from the spool and tie it to a fine twisted linen thread, then insert that thread into the needle. He uses the thread from the spool to suture the intestines and then returns it to the interior. This type of suturing with ants and thread is done out of hope and expectation.
And if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it, and it will not heal at all.

On the Treatment of Common Cold and Fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it persists and becomes chronic, turns into an ulcer that does not heal and continuously discharges pus without stopping; this is generally called a fistula, but we call it a zakhama, and this is the fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, whitish, painless complication with a cavity like the hollow of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather. It may be moist at times, continuously discharging pus, and the moisture may sometimes cease. This moisture can be abundant, scarce, thick, or thin.
And I mentioned in the classification when discussing wounds that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not regenerate is due to one of nine reasons, the first being either a lack of blood in the body, or poor quality blood, or hard flesh inside it and on its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. Or it may be due to excessive foulness and dirt, or the ulcer itself may be putrid and supplied by poor-quality substance, or the treatment may not be appropriate, or there may be corruption in the town similar to an epidemic, or there may be a particular issue with the town.
Or it may be due to excessive foulness and dirt, or the ulcer itself may be putrid and supplied by poor-quality substance, or the treatment may not be appropriate, or there may be corruption in the town similar to an epidemic, or there may be a particular issue with the town. As presented in the city of Zaragoza, where it is difficult for diseases to mature and tumors heal slowly by nature. This may be due to a single bone or several bones, and I have explained all these causes, their signs, and treatments with medications in the division.
Here, I should inform you about the treatment of hemorrhoids and nasal congestion that occurs through manual methods. Know that hemorrhoids can occur in all parts of the body; some extend to major veins and arteries or to nerves.
or to a membrane, or to an intestine, or to a bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a complex joint such as the hand and foot, and there are those that lead to nearness to a major organ and similar cases.
Those hemorrhoids that have this characteristic are among the difficult and incurable diseases, whose treatment is laborious and indicative of ignorance. However, there are some hemorrhoids that do not reach the places mentioned and for which one may hope and desire to treat them.
And if you wish to determine this, take a probe made of copper or iron if the hemorrhoid runs straight and examine it with it. If there is a curve in the hemorrhoid, use a thin lead probe because lead can conform to its shape.
It will slide upon entry and bend toward the curve. If the hemorrhoid has many mouths that you cannot identify with a probe, then inject one of its mouths with fluid; the moisture you inject will travel towards the other mouths and drain them.
Then thoroughly examine it in any way you can to determine if there is a bone or nerve involved, whether the fistula’s depth is far or near, and whether it is a single fistula with many openings. Note all of this as much as your investigation allows, by observing the patient's illness and the presence of pain when you press on the affected area.
And similarly, consider the signs and causes that lead to the formation of a tumor. Once you have firmly established all these factors, then proceed with confidence to treatment by observing whether it is.
If the fistula appears to be superficial and in a place far from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of the locations mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as described and remove what is inside, including any pus, rotten flesh, and excess tissue.
And if any flesh or polypus grows in his mouth, treat it until he is cured. If the fistula is deep but straight, then incise it as deeply as you can and clean it of all rotten flesh.
Then use lint soaked in sharp medications and insert it into the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with an instrument. Repeat this several times until the sharp medicine consumes all remaining decay at the bottom of the fistula.
Then dress it with ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until he is cured. If this does not cure him, then excise it as described earlier. If the cause of the fistula is a bone and you confirm this, then explore and incise it as I have instructed, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If a vein or nerve or main organ, as we said, is exposed to you and the bone is diseased and blackened, then strip it until its corruption is removed, then treat it with what will heal it until it is cured. If it does not cure and pus continues to form as it did before.
Know that you have not reached the complete removal of all corruption, so reopen it completely and examine its stripping and purification with your utmost effort, then treat it. If it heals, otherwise know that this corruption is in a deep recess of decay, so reopen it completely again.
Examine its stripping and purification with your utmost effort; if the diseased bone is a small bone and it is possible to pull it out, then pull it out with delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, then thoroughly pull out all of them without leaving any behind, to the best of your ability. If ligaments or muscles hinder you and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and muscles if they are present and free the bones.
If it is not possible for you to remove the bones at that time, then apply something to the wound that will cause putrefaction and leave it for days until what surrounds those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. Preserve the wound so that the incision you made does not heal during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place a bandage soaked in ground sulfur with oil or a bandage soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments on it. Once those ligaments putrefy and the bones soften, it will be easy to remove and pull them out.
If it is a large bone like the bone of the thigh or similar, and only its surface has rotted, then strip it thoroughly until the blackness and corruption are removed, then suture the wound. If, however, a large part has rotted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then it must be excised.
Cut it all where the corruption ends; then treat it until it heals. I will tell you about a condition that occurred in the leg of a young man so that you may use it as an example and aid in your treatment. This young man was of tender age.
About thirty years old, he suffered pain in his leg due to a movement within his body that connected materials to the leg, causing it to swell into a large tumor. There was no external cause for this, and over time, with mistakes made by physicians, the tumor eventually burst.
A large amount of material flowed from it, and he was improperly treated until the leg became ulcerated with many openings that all discharged pus and bodily fluids. He was treated by a group of physicians for about two years, but none of them were skilled in surgical techniques.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with material flowing from those openings in great quantity. The man had become emaciated and his complexion yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings; the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found them connected to each other from all sides of the leg. So I acted promptly and made an incision at one of those openings until some bone was exposed. I found it rotten, having decayed, turned black, and become putrefied with perforations that had reached the bone marrow. I excised what was visible to me.
Remove the bone that is diseased, and I think there is no other corruption in the bone than what you have cut out and exposed; then I have excised it. Then I bandaged the wound with healing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. So I returned to examine the bone again, above the previous examination.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I exposed what appeared to be that corruption as well. Then I tried to heal it, but it did not heal or unite. So I examined it again and continued to cut the bone piece by piece, attempting to heal each part, but it would not heal until I had removed about an inch of the bone.
I removed it along with the marrow, then I healed it with medicines and it united quickly and he recovered. This repetition in his treatment was necessary due to the patient's weakness, his low tolerance for interventions, and my fear of him dying because severe fainting spells would occur at any time from excessive vomiting. He ultimately made a complete recovery.
Flesh grew in the place of the bone, it became solid, and his condition improved in his body; his strength returned, and he resumed his normal activities without any affliction that would harm him while walking. If a prominent bone in a part of the body breaks,
It is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and fasten it at the end of the prominent bone, then have someone pull it upwards. Take another bandage made of coarser wool than the first one.
Then fasten it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end upwards so that the flesh is drawn downward. As you expose the flesh in the area you wish to expose, ensure that the saw does not injure the flesh, and place a piece of wood or a board securely under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the diseased bone, and it should be sawn slightly above the site of the disease so that there is no decay inside the bone, which would not be apparent to the senses on its surface, so you would be forced to saw it again.
If the bone is diseased but not protruding, and it connects to each other with the decay in its middle or in part of it, then expose the flesh from all sides completely, then place the wood below, and saw it from the first side where the decay is.
When you finish sawing it from one side, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be slightly away from the decay as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut out the diseased joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no solution other than excision. If the decay is in the wrist or ankle, its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the decay as it appears to you, excise it, and clean it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever means you find convenient when an artery or nerve does not obstruct you, and know that the saws and cutting tools for cutting these bones are many according to the position of the bones, their height, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suitable for each type of work.
And know that the tasks themselves may guide you to the type of tool you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because skill in the profession and experience with various diseases will show you the way. He may deduce for himself what corresponds to it from the instruments for every disease, and I will depict for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.

Chapter Eighty-Seven.
On amputating limbs and exposing bones.
Limbs may become gangrenous either due to external causes or internal reasons. If you treat this corruption with medication and the treatment is ineffective, and you see that the corruption is spreading in the limb and nothing can stop it.
You should amputate that limb up to where the corruption has spread, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a greater affliction than the loss of the limb. A sign that this situation has occurred is when the limb turns black as if it were burnt by fire.
Or it may become gangrenous after turning black, and the corruption spreads to adjacent parts and throughout the body; therefore, you should promptly amputate it. The same applies if the cause of the corruption is due to the bite of certain venomous creatures such as a sea scorpion or snake or spider and the like.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not wait for the corruption to spread to the hand. Similarly, if the corruption has reached the hand, amputate it at the wrist joint and do not wait for the corruption to spread further into the forearm.
And if it takes in the arm, cut the arm at the elbow joint itself; if corruption is permissible and you see that it has reached near the shoulder, do not cut the shoulder at all, for this would cause the patient's death, and use other treatments as much as possible.
And do the same with the leg if corruption takes hold in one of the toes, cut off the toe at one of the joints; if it spreads to the foot, amputate the entire foot; if it reaches the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and resign the patient to death. The method of amputating a limb or its part is to tie a ligature below the place where you intend to cut and another ligature above the place.
Tie one attendant to the lower ligature and another to the upper ligature. You should then expose the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad knife until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or spread it. It is advisable to place bandages of linen cloth on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient excessive pain and inflammation. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly press on the wound or apply some cautery to stop the blood, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligature and treat it until it heals. I will tell you about an example of a case that occurred to a man in his leg, exactly as I have described to you. It happened that there was blackening with burning pain resembling fire in his leg.
This decay was the first to occur in his finger, so he took the entire part. When the man saw the decay spreading through the member along with the severe pain and burning sensation, he amputated it at the joint and healed.
After a long time, that same decay appeared in his thumb. He came to me, and I tried to prevent the spread of the infection by applying medicines to the hand after cleaning his body, but it did not stop, and it began to spread to the other finger.
The decay spread to his hand, so he asked me to amputate it. I refused, hoping to prevent the infection from spreading further, and also because I feared for his life if I were to cut off his hand, as his strength was weak. When he lost hope in me, he returned to his own country.
I heard that he decided to amputate his entire hand, and as a result, he recovered. I have related this story to be of assistance in dealing with cases of this kind of disease and to serve as an example for reference and action.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the Treatment of Abscesses and How to Inject Medicines into Them.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy organs and persists for some time, gathering fluid until it bursts or drains out all that was inside, leaving the area empty as if it were a container.
The skin in that area becomes thin like a patch, but it does not deteriorate to the point of affecting the bone, nerve, or ligament. This is why it is called an abscess rather than an ulcer, unless the fluid remains for a long time and affects any of these parts.
Then it is called nasor or zakkam, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin as it turns [circular] and especially if it has become thin and resembles a piece of cloth, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
If you hope that the skin will adhere and it has not yet reached that degree of corruption, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with injection. This means look at the abscess; if it is large and the pus emanating from it has a foul smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
It is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and resin in equal parts that are combined in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine curdles and becomes as thick as honey. Then take what you need from it, dilute it with water and honey, inject it into the abscess, seal its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by squeezing; do this for days until the abscess is cleansed and the foulness is gone. It may also be injected with water of ashes if this medicine is not available to you, which means take the ashes of vine wood or oak wood and pour water over them.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or water of ashes, then inject it with water mixed with honey and a little powdered resin.
Or inject it with a mixture of honey and syrup, as honey cleanses and washes while syrup adheres to the abscess, especially if the syrup is thick and dry. Once you have done this repeatedly and are certain that the corruption in the abscess has subsided, then inject it with something that promotes flesh growth.
Like taking some of the rose ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent drink, or fill it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the container is narrow and does not accommodate the nozzle of the syringe.
Expand it with iron slightly, or place a thread dipped in Egyptian ointment or squill ointment inside until it fits. Similarly, if the mouth is also wide, sew together its edges so that it accommodates the syringe without excess.
And if the mouth from which pus flows is raised upwards, cut it at its lowest point so that the pus can flow downwards. This is because when pus accumulates in the depths of the cavity, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot cut the cavity downward as desired, then position the organ in such a way that the pus can flow out easily as seems appropriate to you. Alternatively, ensure that no pus is retained within it at all.
As for the healing medicines that are applied to the cavity from the outside and how they are placed on it, take one of the suitable ointments and apply it to a piece of linen. The piece of linen should be large enough to cover the entire cavity. Then cut with scissors a hole opposite the mouth of the cavity, slightly wider than the mouth of the cavity. Apply some of the soft ointment to another piece of cloth large enough to cover the hole and place it over it, leaving it somewhat apart from the mouth of the cavity to facilitate the easy flow of pus out of it. Do not remove the larger cloth until after.
For a number of days, and as for that which is on the mouth of the cavity, it should be removed at every opportunity so that what has collected within can come out, to know what flows from it whether much or little, ripe or unripe.
And also, check the place of the cavity itself to see if its owner feels pain there or not, and whether there is swelling or no swelling. If your treatment continues like this and you see that the matter coming out from the mouth of the cavity is minimal.
Then know that the cavity has adhered or is about to adhere. Therefore, remove it tomorrow or on the third day. When you remove the dressing, replace it with a new one and renew the ointment. If thin pus comes out from the cavity after a long period of time, do not despair of its adherence.
He will recover soon because among people, there are those whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds and others for whom it is the opposite. If thin pus comes out from the cavity after many days, then know that the cavity has not adhered, as the adherence of the cavity may be slow.
And if the matter is prolonged, increase the drying of the medicines. Let there be medications that are moist in consistency but dry in strength, such as the palm ointment when more of the calquat has been added to it. The most effective treatment may involve using the palm ointment.
It should be removed with rose oil, and then sprinkle the moderate aged liquid on it. Then knead it with that and use it. You can do something similar if the palm ointment is not available. If you cook honey until it thickens and use it, or take myrrh, fenugreek, and spikenard, grind them all together, and sprinkle them over the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it to a piece of cloth and secure it over the dressing or paint it with honey that you have cooked until it thickens, sprinkle the medicines on it, place the bandage over it, and secure it.
And in such cases, long mastic resin, the root of the asphodel, carob flour, and individual or combined squills that are crushed and sifted can be sprinkled on the honey described and used. If the wound does not heal after prolonged use of this treatment, know that there is corruption deep within it.
And if it has affected the bones or any other solid nerves or ligaments, treat it as you would a nasal polyp, as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Ingrown Toenails, Bruised Nails, Removal of Supernumerary Fingers, and Separation of Joined Fingers.
An ingrown toenail is excess flesh that grows under the big toe's nail or sometimes under other fingers and toes. If it is neglected and left untreated for a long time, it becomes inflamed and forms a hot abscess.
Or it may腐烂到如此程度，以至吃掉指甲的根部，甚至可能完全毁坏它，并且腐败可能蔓延到骨头，导致发出恶臭，使指尖变得肿胀并且呈灰暗色。如果你按照我们之前所述的方法治疗而没有见效，那么：
You should then cut with iron all the excess growth from the nail, and afterwards cauterize the wound, as cauterization is very beneficial in this case. However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,
The corner containing the nail had been wrapped so that the flesh was drawn inward and was being irritated and damaged; therefore, you should place a thin layer under the corner of the nail that irritates the flesh and lift it up, then cut away that flesh gently.
Apply caustic and consuming medicines to the remaining flesh until it is completely removed, then treat it with ointments until it heals. However, if the corruption has affected the bone, you should cut out that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is a corrupt bone present at all.
If you see the decay and corruption spreading in the finger, then cut it at one of the joints as previously described and treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and severe pain occurs, you should first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp scalpel in a slanted incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh underneath the nail, as this will cause severe pain to the patient and may lead to excessive tissue growth in the area. Then treat the area with something that alleviates pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes develops in some people, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones in parts of it, and it may also have a nail. Its growth often occurs at the base of one of the joints of the fingers.
Or its growth may occur in some joints of the finger. Those that grow at a joint do not move, while those that grow near the finger joint sometimes can move. Cutting flesh alone is easier to manage; you should cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.
As for the one that grows at the base of a joint, its treatment is difficult, so you should avoid cutting it. As for the one that grows in a finger near one of the knuckles, it should be cut first by removing the flesh in a circular manner to the bone, then the bone should be exposed with one of those files suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the fusion that occurs between fingers with each other, this often happens and can be something a person is born with or may occur after a wound has healed or from a burn or similar cause; in such cases, it should be split apart.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a piece of felt or a pad soaked in rose oil so that they do not fuse too quickly. Keep them separated or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the area properly heals.
If fusion occurs between some of the fingers on the hand, then split that fusion as is appropriate to restore the proper shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the Cutting of Warts.
Warts are tortuous, thick veins filled with dark superfluous matter and they occur in most parts of the body, but most commonly in the legs, especially on the shins, ankles, and thighs. First, one should use black hellebore to purify the body vigorously several times.
Then let blood from the patient using basilik (a type of lancet). As for treating them with iron, it is done in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood, and the other is to slit the vein and extract it entirely. For cutting, do this first by warming the leg with hot water.
Until the thick, turbid blood dissolves, then bind the patient's leg above the thigh to just below the knee with a turban, then cut the vein in one place or two places or three places widely.
Then remove the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg to the top and from the top to the bottom until you release as much as you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength can tolerate, then bind it and order him to avoid foods that produce black bile. Repeat the evacuation and bloodletting.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient, then removing it should be done in this manner: If there is a lot of hair on the patient's leg, shave it off. Then take him to the bathhouse and pour hot water over his leg until it turns red and starts sweating or until he exercises vigorously.
If a bathhouse is not available to warm the limb, then make an incision along the vein either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and remove the vein from all sides until it appears clearly to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it as a bright red color; once it is free from the skin, you will also see that it resembles a tendon. Then insert under it a probe until it rises and comes out of the skin, then suspend it with a blunt, smooth forceps. Then make another incision near that incision, about three finger breadths away.
Then remove the skin from the vein until it appears, then raise it with a probe as you did before and suspend it with another forceps as you did initially. Then make another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then pull it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it out through the second incision; then pull it up to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third highest incision of all, and when it is completely pulled out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a strong threaded needle doubled over and tie it; then pull it out, and insert the probe underneath it and twist your hand in all directions until it comes out; be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
It may cause harm to the patient when entering, so when you have extracted it completely, place wool soaked in syrup and rose oil or oil on the site of the incisions and treat it until it heals. If the object is twisted with wrinkles and twists in various directions,
and it is not straight as we said, then you should make an incision at every wrinkle and twist. Then attach hooks to pull it out completely. Be cautious when making these cuts so that you do not cut or injure the vein, for if you do, it will be difficult for you to extract it, so exercise caution.
An image of the method used to incise and extract the object:.
Image of the blind hook:.
It should not be curved like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp to avoid injuring the vein. It should have a thick bend and be smooth, as if it were too thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness; rather, it should have an extra thickness as we said,.
Chapter Ninety-One.
In Slitting the Median Vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and other Arab lands, and in hot, dry, and somewhat fertile regions. It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs due to a corruption that occurs beneath the skin.
It also occurs internally as snakes, worms, and gourds, and worms that develop between the skin and flesh. The sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by swelling in that area, and then the vein begins to emerge from where it has swelled.
It appears as if it were the root of a plant or animal. When one end of it becomes visible, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from a quarter to half a dirham, and then tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something comes out externally, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it but do not cut it from its root before it has all come out, for if you cut it prematurely, it will retract into the flesh, causing a tumor, corruption, and a poor ulceration in that area.
Therefore, it is necessary to handle it carefully and draw it out little by little until it is completely removed from the body, leaving nothing of it inside. In some people, this vein may extend five fingers' breadths or more in length.
I have heard that in one case, it extended up to twenty fingers' lengths for a man. If it breaks during your treatment, insert a probe into its opening and pack it tightly with padding along the body until all of its contents are expelled, and then attempt to cleanse the area with medications for several days.
Then treat it as you would a tumor, and if this vein has many branches, especially if it appears in a joint or on the leg itself, it will have many openings from which branches emerge; treat it as described in the division and according to what was mentioned previously.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Regarding the incision for the worm that develops under the hide and is called the disease of cattle.
This disease is called in some of our countries "the disease of cattle" because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and spreads throughout the body, moving up and down.
It can be detected by sensation as it moves from one part of the body to another until it breaks through the skin where it emerges. It is formed from the putrefaction of some mixtures, as occurs with worms, snakes, and cucumber seeds in the abdomen.
The harm it causes is anticipated when it moves through the body, rises to the head, and reaches the eye, where it may emerge and destroy the eye; this often happens. If you wish to treat it and remove it, it must be done when it is moving and can be felt.
You should secure the area above and below it tightly with a bandage, then make an incision and remove it. If it sinks deep into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cauterization to the spot with fire until it is burned. The greatest concern is its potential to destroy the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has become near the eye in the head, then tie under it on the forehead tightly, then incise upon it and extract it. It is advisable to treat the patient by purifying his body with medicines that facilitate the expulsion of putrid and bad humors and to avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Regarding the incision for the disease known as naffur.
This disease, which is called naffur in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then transfers from one organ to another. I have seen it as I will describe to you.
I was called to see a sick woman in one of the villages. When I examined her arm, I noticed a slight swelling in the tendon of the biceps muscle. After waiting for a short while, I saw this swelling moving along with the tendon like a worm, ascending towards her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain subsides in that place and settles in the shoulder. Then, after sitting for a while, it spreads throughout the body until it reaches the other arm. She then told me that it circulates through her entire body as I had observed.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one organ to another. I had not before seen this disease in such a manner, although I have heard of cases where others felt pain moving from one organ to another; I have never observed it as clearly as I did in this woman.
I did not consider this except that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins; hence, it appeared to the senses as such vapor. It must not be apparent by this measure in those of luxury, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, then if it appears to you as described, bind it tightly above and below with bandages and incise it until that congested vapor is released, and then cauterize the area.
If you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by purging the body and using remedies that expel gases and disperse them, such as bad-smelling seeds, scammony seeds, and similar medicines.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On Removing Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and according to the places where they lodge in the body. As for their difference according to types, there are large and small arrows; some are hollow glass (shafted) and others are solid glass; and there are those with three angles and four angles.
And there are those with blades and others with splinters. As for those that differ according to the parts of the body where they lodge, they are of two types: either in principal organs that are hollow, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar organs. When an arrow lodges in any of these organs and signs of death, which I will describe to you later, become apparent, it is advisable to avoid removing that arrow, as death often ensues. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow does not retreat into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs if an arrow hits the brain and pierces the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain, then a severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo will occur from that.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow does not retreat into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs if an arrow hits the brain and pierces the bone and injures the membrane covering the brain, then a severe headache, dizziness, and vertigo will occur from that. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, contraction, confusion of mind, vomiting, and it may happen that blood comes out of the nostrils or ears. Speech may stop, the voice may disappear, and a white moisture like porridge may come out from the wound site, running like watery flesh.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not been removed. As for the signs of the arrow when it strikes the heart and is near the left breast and feels as though it has embedded in something solid rather than empty.
It may also happen that the arrow has a movement similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting. Know for certain that death is inevitable. And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the release of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck become swollen, the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily, asking for cold air to inhale. If the arrow hits the membrane in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs, and breathing will be severe with intense pain.
He sighs, and all the shoulder organs move. If the arrow hits the liver, it will be followed by severe pain, and blood like the color of the liver will come out from the wound. If the arrow hits the stomach, something undigested may come out from the wound.
It is obvious [what to do], and if the arrow hits the abdomen and lodges there, and something comes out of the wound from the feces or the corrupted flesh or an intestine that has been perforated, then there is no hope for treatment or removing the arrow. If the arrow penetrates the bladder and urine comes out.
And if something protrudes out and the pain becomes severe for the patient, know that he is doomed. As for other parts such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, vertebrae of the back, elbow joint, thigh, leg, and similar parts, they usually fare better under similar circumstances.
If the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I will inform you about what I have observed regarding such arrows so that you may use it to guide your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the root of his nose at the base of his eye.
He removed it for him from the other side, underneath the ear lobe, and he recovered with no harm to his eye. I also extracted an arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the fleshy part of his eyelid below the lower eyelid; the arrow had become hidden inside, and all that was visible was its small tip attached to the shaft.
It was a large arrow from the arrows made of steel, smooth with no notches. The Jew recovered with no adverse event to his eye. I also extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian; the arrow was Arabian.
It had two notches. I made an incision between the windpipe for him, as it had sunk into his throat. I handled it gently and extracted the arrow; the Christian recovered and healed. I also removed another arrow from a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it.
After thirty days or so had passed and there was no change in his condition, I cut along the arrow and maneuvered it out of him, and he recovered without any adverse incident. I also saw a man who was struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound became inflamed around it.
After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh. I also saw a woman who was struck by an arrow in her abdomen; the wound became inflamed around it, but the arrow remained and there was no change in her condition, nor did she find any harm from it in performing any natural functions.
I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face; the wound became inflamed around it, but he did not feel much pain. There are many similar cases. I removed an arrow from a commander of the Sultan who had been struck in the center of his nose, which had slightly shifted to the right side.
The arrow had completely penetrated, and I was called to treat him three days after the incident. I found that the wound from the arrow was very narrow. I probed it with a thin probe but could not feel the arrow. He felt a pricking pain and discomfort under his right ear due to the wound.
I suspected that the pricking sensation might be from the tip of the arrow, so I bandaged the area with a dressing that had some traction, hoping that it would swell and reveal a sign of the arrow. When I reopened the area, there was no indication that the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued to keep the dressing on for many days, but no event occurred. During this time, I sealed up the wound. The patient became despondent about removing the arrow until one day he felt it inside his nose and informed me of this sensation. I then applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it, feeling the thin tip of the arrow that was embedded in the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with this sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and it took me about four months for it to progress to this point.
Then, when the wound had widened and it became possible for me to insert pincettes into it, I pulled on it and moved it, but it did not respond to coming out. So I continued to handle it gently and devise various tools until one day I managed to grasp it with firmly placed pincettes, as depicted in the illustration at the end of this section.
And the physicians had ruled that his nasal cartilage could not be set, but I did set it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely without any harm at all. I am telling you about the method of extracting some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and an example for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be comprehended by description alone, nor can a book fully encompass it. Rather, the skilled craftsman measures the little against the much, and what is present against what is absent, and when faced with unusual circumstances, he deduces new work and invents new tools.
If I were to speak about this craft, I would say that arrows are extracted from the parts in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling them out from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side, and those that are removed from where they entered.
If the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, it should be pulled out. If it does not come out easily at the time of its insertion, you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it decomposes, making it easier to pull and remove. The same applies if it has lodged in bone.
If it does not come out even after a few days, leave it and try to pull and move it every day, as it will eventually come out. If it still does not come out after several more days, you should drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a small awl until there is enough space for the arrow, then pull it out and remove it.
If the arrow lodged in the bone of the head has penetrated one of the cavities of the brain and some of the symptoms mentioned to you have appeared in the patient, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until after several days when you can assess his condition.
Then proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is lodged deeply and does not come out when pulled, use drills around the arrow as described to you, then treat the area until it heals. As for if the arrow has become concealed in a part of the body. And if it is hidden from perception, search for it with a probe. If you locate it, pull it out using some tools suitable for the task. If you are unable to do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is lodged, and there is no bone, nerve, or artery nearby.
Cut it open until the wound is enlarged and you can reach the arrow to remove it. If the arrow has two barbs, grasp them and carefully separate the flesh entangled with each barb from every direction by any means possible. Crush the barbs if you cannot free the flesh, then bend or break them to extract the arrow.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow from any part, use your fingers with forceps in all directions until you free it, and be as gentle as possible so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you cannot manage it within the time available.
Leave it for days until the surrounding flesh begins to decay, then return to remove it, as it will be easier at that time. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in its section. Be cautious not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon, and employ skillful techniques.
Use any method you can to safely remove the arrow, doing so with gentleness, patience, and caution as described. When pulling out the arrow, it is best to position the patient as he was when the injury occurred, which is more favorable.
If you cannot do so, use whatever position is possible. As for the arrow that exits from the opposite side, either part of it will protrude outward, or you can feel its tip by touch near the surface of the skin, appearing to be coming out.
Cut it open, and let the incision be just large enough for the forceps. Then pull it out, as it will come more easily. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your fingers around its circumference until the arrow affects the bone, widening its path, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for days until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in it, push it out with that. If the shaft has fallen out and you wish to use pushing, then insert a hollow instrument into it so that its hollow part enters the arrow's base, then push it out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that can enter its hollow part; thus, the arrow will come out easily. If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that has been affected by the poison if possible, then treat it as appropriate.
If the arrow is embedded in the chest or abdomen or bladder or flank and it is near an area that can be probed with a probe, and if you can make an incision on it, then do so while being careful not to cut any vein or nerve, and remove the arrow.
Then outline the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals. Image of the clamps used to extract arrows:.
Its ends should be like a bird's beak, designed to grip the arrow or any object tightly without letting go. Various sizes are made from it—large, small, and medium—all according to the size of the arrow, its thickness, and the width of the wound.

Image of the solid gun:.
This is solid at the tip like a rod to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out,.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
On Venesection.
There are thirty veins in the body that are typically subjected to venesection, sixteen of which are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the temporal veins, the two veins visible on the temples, and the two veins at the inner corner of the eyes known as the nasal veins.
The upright vein in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins on the sides of the neck, the two veins on the upper lip, and the two veins on the lower lip, which are known as the labial veins, and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins that are venesectioned in the arm and hand, there are five veins. The first is the cephalic vein, which is on the lateral side, and it is commonly known as the head vein. The aeculus, which is the middle vein, composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, and it is commonly known as the body vein.
The basilic vein, which is on the medial side, and it is also called the axillary vein; it is commonly known as the abdominal vein. The brachial artery, which is located on the forearm and is visible prominently above the thumb. The median antebrachial vein.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins: the first is beneath the kneecap on the lateral side, the second is the medial malleolar vein located on the inner side of the heel, and the third is the peroneal vein, located on the lateral side of the Achilles tendon.
In the other leg, there are also three veins like them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in diverting chronic catarrhs, pleurisy, carbuncles, and chronic ulcers of the head that are poor and difficult to heal, and how to ligate them as I describe.
It is done by shaving the patient's head and vigorously rubbing the back of the neck with a coarse cloth at the location of the veins. Then, the patient's neck is tightly wrapped with a turban until the two veins become visible behind the ears in the lowest parts of the head. You should then press on them with your finger; where you feel their pulse under your finger, that is where you mark it with ink.
Then take a scalpel, which is known as a lancet, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein along with the skin in one clean cut. The length of the incision should be about two clenched fingers.
Or something similar, let out the amount of blood you desire, then tie them with bandages and leave them until they heal. It was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book how to cut and cauterize them. As for the two arteries in the temples, their benefit is in diverting chronic pleurisy, severe headaches, persistent conjunctivitis, and acute profuse discharges towards the eyes.
And the way to ligate them as I describe to you is for the patient to tightly wrap his neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible to your touch and their pulse becomes apparent under your finger. At that moment, mark it with ink, then lift the skin above the vein by pressing upwards from above the vein with your index finger.
The scalpel is inserted and the vein is raised from below, then it is cut as was done with the other two veins. Let blood according to your need, then loosen the patient's tourniquet and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a cotton pad and dressing on it, and secure it tightly from above. Leave it until he recovers; I have previously mentioned its description, cutting, and removal at the beginning of the book. As for bleeding the forehead vein, its benefit comes after bleeding the temporal vein for chronic facial ailments such as sapphire (a type of skin condition), ulcers, and persistent redness.
And the method of bleeding it is as I will describe to you. The patient should tighten his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then take the instrument called the faes, and this is its appearance:
Place the prong at the head of the faes on the same vein and strike it from above with a comb or something similar. Allow the blood to flow as much as you desire, then loosen the patient's tourniquet and secure it until he recovers.
It may also be opened with a broad scalpel, but the scalpel should not have sharp tips like other scalpels; instead, it should have slightly wide tips. Bleed it obliquely because the bone is close, and the scalpel might break if it were thin.
As for the two veins at the inner corner of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and ocular discharges, as well as facial diseases. As for how to bleed them, the patient should tighten his neck with a turban, then you should bleed both veins while standing behind the patient's head. The bleeding should be slightly oblique along the length with a small, slightly broad scalpel.
If the area has no flesh, then if the blade is thin at the tip, it may break. Then send for as much blood as you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then release them. As for bleeding the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fever.
Severe headache and diseases of the face, such as red swellings that appear in the nose, especially if they are chronic. The method of bleeding it is to have the patient pull his neck taut, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin long blade.
Insert it in the middle of the nasal tip itself, between the nasal bones in a straight line because the vein does not appear to the touch there; blood will immediately emerge. You should press with your hand on the blade slightly and let out as much blood as you need, then bind it for one night because it quickly regenerates.
As for the jugular veins, bleeding them is beneficial for difficulty in breathing, the onset of leprosy, and skin diseases such as black vitiligo, carbuncles, poor ulcers, and those that consume tissue. The method of bleeding them is to have the patient tighten a ligature under them at his neck, and the surgeon stands behind the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then you bleed the vein to its length with a slightly wide incision, and let out a moderate amount of blood or as much as you see fit based on the need, then do the same for the other vein, and finally release the ligature.
Tighten the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and leave him until tomorrow because the wound will heal. As for the veins of the cheekbones, bleeding them after bleeding the temporal veins is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, poor ulcers, splits in the lips, and poor ulcers.
which are in the nose and around it, and how to extract them: Have the patient sit before you and pull his neck with a turban, then spread his lips and look at the two veins that you see one on the right side of the lip and the other on its left, and distinguish them by their blackness.
This is also because around them are thin black veins, so you should cut them off cleanly. If you are unsure and do not know what they are, aim to cut the larger and more apparent ones. Do the same with the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, their extraction is beneficial after extracting the uvula for treating abscesses in the throat caused by laryngitis and diseases of the mouth. The method of extracting them is to have the patient sit in front of you facing the sun, raise his tongue, and look underneath it on one side for a vein and on the other side for another vein, both of which are dark in color.
Extract them carefully without overcutting, as there are arteries beneath them, and excessive cutting may cause bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that are extracted in the elbow, it is a common practice to extract them universally, and their extraction has two methods.
Either by puncturing with a broad rhizome scalpel or an olive-shaped one to the thin skin, or by cutting with a knife-like scalpel, which is called incision [and this is its image]. This is the image of the broad rhizome scalpel:
It is broad as you can see, suitable for opening hollow veins that are full, prominent, and visible, which contain thick, turbid blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped scalpel:
This lancet is narrower and thinner at the tip, suitable for cutting thin veins containing watery yellow blood. This is a picture of the lancet called nashl: .
This lancet is suitable for incisions and comes in various widths and thinnesses, depending on the width and narrowness of the veins. It can also be used as a guide for others, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of cutting it is that it draws blood from ailments located under the neck and throat, near the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist should be cautious when cutting it and have a measure of fear, as there is an artery beneath it; if he errs and goes too deep with the lancet, he may cut this artery.
This will cause a profuse bleeding, so it should not be cut with a lancet for puncture but rather by incision with a scalpel. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it is advisable to avoid it and opt for another vein or seek one of its branches.
Or you can bleed from the arm vein, which is clear, and incise it with a scalpel as we have said. If you wish to cut it specifically, before tightening the arm, you should palpate the area until you identify the pulse location, then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and make an oblique incision on the vein with a scalpel as we have said, being careful to place the cut away from the artery location. When you pull the tourniquet tight and see a swelling in the area where you marked with ink, that swelling is the bulge of the artery; avoid it.
If you see the blood during phlebotomy spurt like the urine of a young boy and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from an artery. At this point, quickly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often stops. Secure the arm.
Leave it as it is and warn the patient not to neglect it. Let it be on his neck and do not move it for days until he recovers. If the bleeding does not stop and overwhelms you, and no treatment is available at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take the peel of a pistachio and split it, then take one half and firmly bind it to the site of the bleeding with a ligature and bandage for another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise treat it as previously mentioned using compresses that stop bleeding. Cutting off the bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the wound and the firmness of the ligature on the arm, be aware of this. As for the black vein, its benefit in phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the top of the head to the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic vein, as we have said.
It is advisable for the phlebotomist to place the incision on the neck of the patient because there is a nerve underneath it. If he increases the depth of the scalpel and injures the nerve, numbness will occur that is difficult to detect, and it may never heal properly. This nerve is often noticeable by touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision for it with a needle and avoid bandaging as much as possible. If the vein is between two bandages, cut the vein lengthwise. As for the jugular vein, the benefit of cutting it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and if you wish to cut this vein in particular; it is better to do so with a needle or a wide scalpel like the rose scalpel because it is safer than all veins since there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, when making an incision, you should avoid cutting only the muscle's head with the scalpel and seek a softer spot. It does no harm if it is not hit on the first attempt and requires multiple incisions, except that in some people it may swell if not cut on the first attempt.
However, this swelling does him no harm. As for the method of bloodletting and its consequences, and what should be done to correct it: first, you should know that bloodletting is used only to maintain health.
Or it is used for treating diseases. The bloodletting that is used to maintain health and prevent the occurrence of diseases should be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the jugular vein, the cephalic vein, and the basilic vein. It should also be performed at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear.
It should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since sunrise. As for bloodletting used to treat diseases, it has no fixed time but is performed whenever necessary, whether day or night.
In every hour and in every time, and it should not be that children are bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor the elderly who have surpassed sixty years. If anyone intends to bleed for any reason.
It is advisable to clean his intestines before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained fecal matter, so that during bleeding, putrid excesses do not draw into the veins from the intestines and harm the principal organs. Do not bleed a person who is nauseous, intoxicated, or drunk until those conditions have passed.
He should also be cautious about bleeding immediately after vomiting, diarrhea, defecation, excessive sexual activity, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything else that weakens the body physically or mentally. Then check to see if the humors need to be thinned before bleeding if the blood is thick.
By foods, drinks, and medicines if possible, then he should take a bath if nothing prevents him or engage in some exercise to thin the blood. He should aim to bleed during the morning as we said, and strive to keep his mind free of all bad mental distractions on that day.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical burdens like excessive fatigue, overexertion, sexual activity, and the like. And prepare for him things that people usually use, such as varieties of perfume, flowers, amusements, and the like, each person according to what is possible for them.
Then the bloodletter should sit on a cushion that is higher than the one the patient sits on. Then he extends his arm, and the bloodletter rubs it twice or three times with his hand. He then ties the tourniquet tightly and twists it two or three times, but the pressure should be moderate.
Because when the tension is not moderate, either by excess in tension it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is too relaxed it also prevents the flow of blood; then after the tension, it should be rubbed with his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become visible to the senses; then the surgeon should wipe the scalpel with a little old oil, especially, and then he places his index finger of the left hand on the same vein below the intended site slightly so that the vein does not escape, thereby avoiding the blow. Because there are veins that you find like a tendon, which escapes when punctured, and there are those filled with air; whenever the scalpel is placed on them, they collapse under the scalpel and deceive the surgeon, and he does not open the vein. Even if he opens it, it will be only slightly.
Therefore, the surgeon should be cautious and deliberate in all these matters, then place the scalpel to open the vein. If the vein opens on that attempt, otherwise he should repeat it once again below or above that site quickly if the area does not swell.
If it swells or the patient becomes anxious, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, as it may cause inflammation. Do not enter the bathhouse either. Then proceed with bloodletting if desired, if the scalpel has penetrated but the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin.
And if I fear that the amount of blood you want will not be drawn, reinsert the scalpel into the same hole gently and slightly enlarge the opening. Do this quickly before the area swells, as in many people the site may swell even with a small incision.
If you see that it has swollen, do not repeat [the procedure] at all, for it will be of no assistance to you. Place something on it from oak oil, for it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this place than the oil itself and other fats as well.
Use oak oil in all your phlebotomy procedures when the flow of blood is difficult. The theriac Farag and Shakhzunaya can also be used if one of them is applied to the area, as it thins and dissolves thick blood.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of bleeding, it often happens, especially for those who have been bled only that once or whose vein was opened slightly. Act quickly and place an sponge soaked in warm water and salt on the swelling and hold it there for an hour; it will dissipate.
You should do this after the blood has completely exited from the vein itself or from another vein. If after days there remains some blackness or greenness in the area, it does no harm; if you wish, apply something from dissolved rue and wormwood to it.
Or apply something from the juice of fumitory or similar. Often a swelling and bad knot occurs when bleeding basilic veins; place your hand on it, and if you find that it softens when you press it, then that is a bad knot; be cautious not to put anything on it from what was mentioned.
It may cause an artery to bleed, but bind it with something that causes constriction to harden the area, then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. It is advisable to remove from each person’s blood according to their strength and the predominant color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red. Similarly, if you see it thick, allow it to flow until it becomes thin. Likewise, if it is sharp [in quality], wait until its sharpness subsides. It is appropriate for a person who is full and strong and needs to have bloodletting done all at once.
Expand the incision for bloodletting, and let the scalpel be wide. For a weak person, do the opposite of this. It is best to draw blood in several sessions, and the puncture should be narrow. The most suitable method for bloodletting is to make it oblique and as a cut, not a stitch.
This type of bloodletting is free from excessive bleeding and cutting nerves, and it is safer and better than bloodletting by width or length. For those who often experience fainting during bloodletting, it is advisable to feed them something made of soaked bread in pomegranate water, vinegar, or tarragon before the procedure.
If he is bloodlet over three or four sessions, and if his temperament is cold, he should take soaked bread in syrup of rue or in sweetened honey scented with spices or in fragrant herbal syrup before the bloodletting.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is the excessive loss of blood, he should be given meat water and light fragrant syrup to drink. The use of perfumed oils should be applied, and his chest should be massaged with it. He should also be treated with all that we have mentioned for the treatment of fainting as described in the section on fainting.
For those who wish to relieve arm tension and release blood again, it is appropriate for someone whose bloodletting was for the expulsion of a large amount and whose strength is weak to gradually release the blood in small amounts according to their strength over consecutive days.
And as for him who wishes to relieve his arm and let blood again, and whose body is strong, let him do so seven or nine hours after his first letting. As for him who wants to draw blood from his body toward the opposite side to which it inclined, he should be bled on the second or third day.
And as for him in whose body there is much blood that has become heated and intense, causing fever, it should be drawn out all at once, and a large quantity should be taken out, widening the incision until fainting occurs after ensuring compliance with all conditions of bleeding. And place your hand on his pulse as the blood flows to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often occurs if the leecher is ignorant and neglectful. And it should not be done if you wish to relieve the arm and let blood again.
And if the mouth of the vein has closed and the blood is hard to draw, do not pinch it forcefully or twist it with great strength, for that is very bad. Instead, either leave it until you bleed it again or remove with a scalpel any coagulated blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply a little salt dissolved in water to it, or apply a little of the sovereign antidote or zennaia and pinch it gently until the blood flows. If the vein has become swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If there is a necessity to let blood again, then either bleed above that place or bleed in the other arm or in another vein.
And as for cutting the tendon of the arm, it should be cut instead with colocynth and balsam if they are not available or are scarce, because it is composed of them. The method of its cutting is that the patient should put his hand in hot water until the joint reddens and sweat appears clearly, then bind above it slightly with moderate pressure.
Then cut the tendon slightly off-center, neither wide nor long, and make the incision wide. Your cutting should be just above the wrist joint. If blood does not flow out, put the hand back in the hot water container and let the blood run into the water.
Until it meets your need. If you are in the days of summer, you may be able to do without putting the hand back in hot water. The flow of blood into hot water is more common in winter. Cutting this tendon is safer than cutting any other tendons. Because there is no harmful tendon or nerve under it. As for cutting the asilim from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of its cutting is that you should bind the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the tendon swells.
Because there is no harmful tendon or nerve under it. As for cutting the asilim from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of its cutting is that you should bind the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after immersing it in hot water until the tendon swells. It becomes very clear to the senses. Then cut it slightly off-center, and even if you completely amputate it, it will not harm it. Be careful not to penetrate deeply with the scalpel as there is a nerve under it, and the area is bare of flesh. Then put the hand back in hot water.
Let the blood flow out. If you do not put it back in hot water, the blood will freeze at the opening of the tendon and stop flowing. Once you have extracted enough blood as needed, apply oil and salt to the tendon so that it does not heal too quickly.
And similarly, you should do this for every narrow branch. And the benefit of its removal from the left hand is beneficial for diseases of the spleen, and likewise you should do as with the second one equally. As for the removal of the safin (a vein), it is useful for diseases in the lower part of the body such as diseases of the uterus.
And the retention of menstruation, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers on the thighs and legs, and similar diseases. The method of its removal is that he puts his foot in hot water and applies massage until the veins dilate, then it should be ligated above the joint by the company vein, which is located at the instep toward the thumb.
And it branches out in many places on the leg, so ligate it in its widest branch or at the instep where it comes together; this is better and safer. If you ligate it on the face of the leg, be careful of the nerves beneath the surface of the leg.
And make your ligation for it by twisting, as if you want to amputate it, and let the scalpel be a corkscrew. If the blood does not come out, then immerse his foot in hot water and let the blood flow freely until it is emptied. If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt with the ligation.
Let him attempt the ligation slightly higher up, for this place is safe and no danger need be feared if you are cautious of the nerve as we said. And do the same with the safin vein on the other leg equally. As for the sciatic vein, its location is as we said behind the heel on the inner side.
And the benefit of ligating it is for pain in the hip if it is due to hot blood. The method of its ligation is that you take the patient to the bathhouse and quickly bind his leg from the hip down to four fingers above the heel with a long, thin scarf; otherwise, it will not be apparent.
When it appears, treat it according to how long you will stay in that condition, either by turning it, which is better, or by amputating it completely or cutting it partially if the place is safe. In most people, this is very slight, and if you do not find it.
If it does not appear at all to the senses, treat some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the little toe and the ring finger, be careful of the nerves, and let out as much blood as you desire.
Then release the tension and place a bandage on the site of the bloodletting, and bind the area, for it will heal quickly.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
On Cupping and How to Use It.
Cupping instruments can be made of horns, wood, brass, or glass. Cupping is done in two ways: one with a lancet to draw blood and the other without a lancet.
This cupping without a lancet is done in two ways.
And the cupping sites for the temporal areas, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, the cupping site for the chin, which is under the lower jaw, the cupping sites for the shoulders, the cupping sites for the coccyx at the base of the spine, the cupping sites for the thighs, and the cupping sites for the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and it does not weaken the body as much as phlebotomy does. It should not be used with heat or without heat in any disease caused by excess until the entire body has been purged.
If there is a need for cupping due to a disease or as a preventive measure, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at its end, in the middle, and at any season.
This is because there are people who, when they have an excess of blood that requires removal through cupping, feel heaviness and headaches in their head. Some see swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck. Others experience itching on their face and sides, as well as darkening and inflammation in their eyes. There are also those who itch where the cupping was applied.
Some people become more cheerful, some taste blood in their mouth and their gums swell, and they spit out blood. Others sleep excessively, and see blood, redness, corpses, wounds, and similar things in their dreams. Whenever we observe any of these signs.
In particular, if there is something in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed since noon. As for the benefit of puncture cupping, it is beneficial for heaviness in the head and fluid that drains into the eyes.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the entire body has been purged. This type of cupping can serve as an alternative to phlebotomy at the temporal vein. It is important to avoid using it on those with a cold brain or who have a respiratory ailment, as it may cause them severe harm.
Therefore, they should not be used by the elderly, those who have cold diseases in their heads, or those who are addicted to them, as they can cause forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the phlebotomist to lower his hand slightly downward with the fleam to avoid causing forgetfulness, and as for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for bleeding from the eye socket and the parietal region.
It is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, constriction of the respiratory organs, coughing, and bloating. Cupping the shoulder should be raised slightly because if it is directed downward, it can cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for sudden headaches, conjunctivitis, migraines, throat constriction, and pain at the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for bleeding from the parietal region. You should instruct the phlebotomist not to go deep with the incision so as not to cut an artery and cause excessive bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, and other diseases in the mouth. It can substitute for bleeding from the glands located on the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by bloating and heat.
As for cupping the inner thighs, it is beneficial for what would be treated by bleeding from the three parietal veins (the basiliq, the occipital, and the frontal). This is because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and attracts those thin veins from thicker ones until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
It is necessary to order the leecher not to be excessive in suction because the area is bare of flesh and has nerves and arteries beneath it. As for a single cupping at the coccyx, it is beneficial for piles and sores of the anus.
It is necessary to order the leecher to use a large cup and for it to be made of copper because the area requires strong suction and a glass cup might break, and it should have considerable suction. As for the cupping on the legs, it noticeably reduces swelling.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it induces menstruation and helps with boils and varicose veins. It serves as an alternative to bleeding the ankles and knees, although it greatly weakens the body and often causes fainting. The benefit of cupping the popliteal areas is similar to that of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is as follows: Place the cup first, empty and suction moderately. Do not keep the cups in place for too long but put them on quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area. Continue this process repeatedly until you see the area has reddened and opened up.
When the redness of the blood appears, then apply suction gradually and slowly. Then observe the condition of the body; for those who have thin flesh with loose pores, it is necessary to suction once only so that the area does not become ulcerated.
Order the leecher to widen the incision, deepen it slightly, and adjust the suction gently with slight movement. If the blood is thick, it should be bled twice: in the first time, let him open a path for the thin blood and its watery part, and in the second time, for extracting the thicker blood completely.
If the blood is very thick, the procedure should be repeated a third time to reach the desired effect. In general, if we wish to extract a small amount of blood, one incision suffices; if more blood is needed, additional incisions are made. If the blood is considered viscous.
We should make a deep incision, and the moderate limit in cutting is only as deep as the skin. What should be used of ointments when applying cupping, and what waters to use, and what one who undergoes cupping should avoid. As for those whose skin is thick, hard, black, and with narrow pores.
The areas for cupping should be oiled with substances that are clarifying, softening, and dissolving. If it is summer time, oil such as Khiri oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil may be used.
If it is winter, then oils like narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or hyacinth oil may be used. If the residue is thick and cold, then use oils such as Marzunjush oil, loquat oil, honey oil, or clove oil, and similar ones.
If the person undergoing cupping has wide pores and tender flesh, oil should be avoided. These individuals should wash their cupped areas after the procedure with rose water or cold water, or with fox grape water, gourd water, plantain water, and similar liquids. As for those whose blood is very moist,
They should wash their cupped areas with vinegar or water made from wormwood and sumac, and similar substances. As for those whose residues are thick, they should wash their cupped areas with aged drink or gourd seed water, or by boiling clove or chamomile, and similar ones. It is advisable to avoid cupping in a bathhouse or immediately after bathing.
It is necessary to perform cupping one hour or two hours after leaving the bath, and it is not advisable for anyone to sleep after cupping. It is important to prepare the person who will undergo cupping and the one who will perform it before and after the procedure.
First, you should check if the person who will undergo cupping or the one performing it has jaundice and if their blood is sharp and inflamed. In such a case, they should take cooling agents like pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, scallions, celery, and similar items. Their food should consist of rice dishes, mutton kebabs, stuffed eggs, and similar foods.
And if a person's temperament is cold, they should be given honey syrup, mubyah syrup or celery seed syrup, and aromatic wine that is between old and new. They should be advised to eat less and their food should consist of rice dishes, quinces, birds, and young pigeons roasted. It is necessary for the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting to be more than the food.
It may be necessary to give some people the Feruchemical Triage Elixir or musk medicine or siltha before cupping and bloodletting, or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood. It should not be given by unqualified persons.
As for cupping without conditions, it is the type of cupping placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, and the area of the kidneys and buttocks. These organs cannot tolerate being conditioned upon, and what is intended with them is either to draw blood from one part to another.
As we place the cupping vessel on the breasts in the case of epistaxis or to cool a part that has become hot, so do we use it on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the part and warms it, removing pain by releasing that air.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone, for its strength of suction may open the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place. It does the same when applied to the liver and spleen in case of air that has become entangled in them. These cupping vessels may also be used empty by sucking alone.
It may be used with fire, and it may also be used filled with warm water for ailments of the sciatic nerve. Fill the cupping vessel, let it be large, with hot water alone or with water that has been boiled with some herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then place it filled on the affected area and keep it in position, then remove and replace it as needed. This is an image of the cupping vessel that is used with fire:.
Its mouth should be two open fingers wide, as depicted, and its depth should be half a finger. There should be a small hole on one side, about halfway along it, the size of which an ordinary needle can fit. It is made of Chinese brass or yellow brass with a thick rim.
Smooth and even, polished so as not to harm the part when applied to it. In the center, there should be a small protrusion of brass or iron where the candle with fire is placed. These cupping vessels can also be made larger than described or smaller according to the diseases.
Prepare it as it is used, for the bloodletting cups of children and thin people are not the same as those of men with robust bodies. As for how to place this cup over the part on fire, take a wick made of flax or a small candle made of bitumen, light it with fire, and place it in the middle of the stretched-out tube inside the cup.
Let the fire rise upwards towards the bottom of the cup so that the patient's body does not get burned. Then place it on the part, and your finger over the hole we mentioned until when you have held the cup as needed, remove your finger.
Steam will come out of that hole, and the cup will adhere to its position. Then light the wick as described and repeat if necessary. As for the cup used for treating thrush with water, it has no stretched-out tube or hole in it.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the part only, and this is its image:.
The larger this cup is, the more water it can hold, and thus it is better.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
On the Application of Leeches.
Leeches are used in most cases on parts where bloodletting cups cannot be applied, either because of their small size, such as the lip and gum, or because the part is without flesh, such as a finger or nose.
The method of using them is to select leeches from fresh, clean water, then leave them in fresh water for a day and night until they are hungry and empty inside. Then the body is first evacuated by bleeding or cupping, then the affected part is wiped.
Until it becomes red, then place it on the area. If it fills up and falls off, if possible, sucking the area with a leech is more effective; otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water, massage and squeeze it. If it persists, blood will flow after the leech drops off, which is considered beneficial. Apply a cloth soaked in cold water to the area.
Place it above until the bleeding stops. If there is excessive blood, sprinkle powdered saffron, rose petals, or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place halves of peeled onions on the affected area.
Leave it until the onion halves stick to the area, as this will stop the bleeding. If leeches need to be reapplied, do not reuse the same leech if possible; instead, wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the area to draw out some blood and then place it. If it senses any blood, it will stick in place. If you want to remove it, sprinkle some purslane, salt, or ashes on it; it will fall from its place.
The Third Chapter.
On Fractures and Dislocations.
This chapter is also part of the craft required in the practice of medicine, involving the setting of fractures and the reduction of dislocations in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by ignorant physicians and the common people who have not read any book or studied a single word of the ancients on this subject.
For this reason, this art has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never found it improved at all. And I only acquired what I have through the long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted that knowledge from them, then I adhered to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you from that, in this chapter, all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has been applied to it after I have brought it close to you, freed it from the clutter of verbosity, and summarized it to the extreme while explaining it as clearly as possible, and I have presented many illustrations of the instruments used in it.
For it is an addition to the clarification as I did in the preceding chapters, and there is no strength except with God, the Almighty.
The First Chapter.
It is best to present general points and summaries regarding the treatment of broken bones before we begin to describe individually each fractured or dislocated part. It is appropriate to mention some statements and sections at the beginning of this chapter. It first compels you to understand it and grasp its truth, as well as for those who are eager to learn this noble craft besides yourselves.
So I say that when anyone suffers a fracture, dislocation, swelling, or fall, it is necessary to first proceed with reducing it or purging it, or both. If there is no impediment such as weakness of strength, or if the one affected by it is a child or an old man in his dotage, or if the time is extremely hot or cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold legumes, the meat of birds, and soups. He should avoid drinks, tough meats, overeating, and any food that fills the veins with blood until there is no longer fear of swelling or fluid accumulation at the site.
At that time, the patient should return to his usual regimen. When the broken bone begins to heal, it is advisable for the patient to eat foods that are nutritious and substantial, such as foods with viscosity like broth, rice, heads of animals, feet of animals, and cow stomachs. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods are also beneficial. With this regimen, the union of the fracture will be faster and better. Note that bones fractured in strong men and old people never reconnect as they originally did by nature.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, they do not reconnect as before. However, extremely soft bones, like those of very young children, may connect and unite somewhat. The body generates new tissue around the broken bone that acts like glue, binding it together until the pieces adhere to each other.
It binds the pieces together until it becomes as strong and secure as it was originally, so that nothing impedes its function.
For this reason, it is necessary to make the patient's diet consist of foods that are nutritious, viscous, and substantial, as we have said. And know that fractures vary according to the difference in body parts because a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the skull bone, and a fracture of the chest bone differs from a fracture of the back bone.
And similarly, all other body parts differ from one another. We will come to describe each type of fracture in detail within its own section, separate from others. Also, the nature of a bone fracture may vary itself.
Because it may be a transverse fracture without any splinters, or it may be along the length of the bone with splinters, some clean and others not. The fracture may also occur with a wound or tear in the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
And each type has a specific method for setting it, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. What identifies a bone fracture is its crookedness, irregularity, appearance to the senses, and cracking when you press it with your hand.
When there is no obvious crookedness, or cracking, and you do not feel disturbance when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience much pain, then there is no fracture. It may be a sprain or a slight fracture or a minor crack. Therefore, it should not be moved by stretching or pressing at all.
Rather, apply the medicines that will be mentioned later which are suitable for the condition, then bind it gently. Know that if a bone breaks and splits into two without any splinters, each part may move away from its companion.
You should proceed to correct and straighten it as soon as possible before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then adjust it gently and with skill.
Know that correcting and straightening it is easier when there are no fragments in the bone. Then, secure it as will be mentioned later. If there are fragments in the bone, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
Use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, or combine a rope with your hands. Place the limb in a straight position according to its natural shape so that when the parts of the broken bone extend, then carefully and gently return those protrusions to their proper places using whatever means you can.
Strive to avoid causing pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions. Strive to join one bone to its partner in the best possible manner, and at this time you should feel and examine them with your hand. If you notice anything out of place, correct and adjust it as much as you can.
Be cautious of excessive stretching and strong manipulation, as many unskilled people often do this. They frequently cause a hot swelling or delay in the healing of the limb due to their actions, as I have observed repeatedly.
Then, after correcting and securing the limb, ensure that it remains still and at ease. Advise the patient to avoid moving the limb at any time, whether awake or asleep, during transitions, disturbances, while defecating, and in all movements, to the extent possible. Ensure that the position of the limb is such that it avoids pain.
This is because when he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to a different position where he does not feel any pain, and he must ensure that this new position is level and straight.
To prevent the limb from becoming misshapen when it is set. As for how to bind a broken limb, I will describe that to you. Know that broken limbs vary in size, such as small ones like the arm, finger, and shinbone, among others.
For smaller limbs, such as the arm, finger, and shinbone, the bandages should be soft and gentle. For larger and tougher areas like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be wide and firm because a broad ligament is necessary for large limbs, evenly supporting them from all sides without any unevenness or disturbance.
Then after you have finished adjusting, you should apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a soft but firm bandage to the site of the fracture, then start wrapping the bandage around the site of the fracture itself for three or four layers as needed by the limb. Tighten the bandage slightly with your hand and then move it to the upper part of the fracture site.
Apply less tension than you applied to the site of the fracture, then move away from the fracture site slightly while wrapping and gradually loosen the tension a little. Take a suitable piece from the correct position, then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured site as well.
Wrap for several layers, then move the wrapping to the lower part of the fracture. The tension and looseness of the wrapping should be as described for the initial upper wrapping. Then place soft, flexible padding or cloth between the bandages to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is any deviation, do not insert anything; then wrap it with another bandage, and apply firm splints to this wrapping from your supplies if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and dispel the puffiness, and leave it for several days; then at that time, secure the splints. The splints should be made of half sections of broad reeds prepared with care, or they can be made of sieve wood.
Which are made from pine, palm leaves, rush matting, straw, or similar materials that are available, and the width of each splint should be as in this description and image.
Except for the splint placed directly on the fracture, which should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it should be made according to the size of the broken limb, whether large or small. The appearance of the splint:
Then secure the splints with another bandage as you did initially, and then bind it above with strong threads as we mentioned for securing, which should be tighter around the site of the fracture. The tighter the binding, the closer it is to the fracture; the further from the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, preferably made from wet linen, because if the threads are too thick, as ignorant people often do by making them from twisted strips of linen, it is a great mistake.
Because it causes tension to exceed what is proper, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. It should not be less than a finger’s width between one bandage and another.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the bandages after proper tensioning, place a layer of soft linen or fluffed wool underneath to prevent any injury. As for when there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and the skin is breached, we will discuss this separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be bandaged on the first day. If the limb is large, it should not be bandaged until after five or seven days, or longer, depending on your certainty of preventing the occurrence of a hot swelling.
This is the description of bandages used by earlier times to treat fractures, dislocations, and jaw injuries. It is a general, brief bandage that can stabilize a fracture and is suitable for most constitutions, especially for children and women because it neither causes heat nor cold.
Take dust from the mill, which is the bran that sticks to the walls of the mill during grinding. Mix it as it is without sifting, using egg whites. Make the mixture neither too thick nor too thin and then apply it.
The description of another bandage for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take mastic gum, ladanum, aqakiya (a type of herb), raisin, mugwort, and sugar of each ten dirhams. Take rue and sage from each five dirhams, and Armenian or Roman clay twenty dirhams each. Pound everything and mix it with water of athl or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot. Then use this dressing, for it is well composed; it quickly sets broken bones and suits most people due to its moderation.
The description of another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and wounds: Take ten dirhams each of mastic, frankincense, and white linseed; five dirhams each of rue and horehound; six dirhams of Armenian clay; twenty dirhams. Pound everything finely and sift it, then mix with water or egg whites and use it.
A dressing for joints and displaced bones to relieve pain associated with them, and for bone splitting and fractures: Take linen strips and dip them in vinegar and cooked oil, then apply it to the affected area. This dressing does not have bone-setting properties.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and preventing pain especially. The description of another dressing that sets a broken bone: Take the leaves of the black fig tree and wild opium poppy leaves, pound them together, and apply them moist. Description of another brief dressing used when a bone has healed from a fracture.
And when you want to resolve the remaining swelling, take from the root of linseed and chamomile and woad and flour of cornmeal in equal parts; pound them together and knead with egg white if the part is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, then knead with parsley water or with water and use it.
The description of another stronger dressing for resolving hard swelling that occurs when a bone has healed: Take from the root of linseed, flax seeds, fenugreek, rosemary, wormwood, woad, and chamomile in equal parts.
All should be pounded and mixed with water of khala' or fresh water or clay, whichever is appropriate according to the heat of the limb and its calmness. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that something should be placed on the broken limb when setting it.
Except for the Qirwatyi made of wax and oil, nothing else. He described it as being medium between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he thought that when setting a broken limb, substances that are drying should be applied along with some heat, such as aloeswood, hellebore, frankincense, and similar items mentioned.
A dressing for weakness and pain: take mastic, fenugreek, human cut hair or bird feathers, linseed, and equal parts of salt, all pounded, sifted, mixed, and applied as a dressing. As for the amount that the bandage should allow to remain.
Then do not loosen it; this means that you should observe. If the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place, do not loosen it for many days. If severe itching occurs in the area, painful anxiety, or swelling appears.
Then act promptly and loosen it at the right time without delay, and remove the dressing from it. Then take a soft cloth or sponge freely moistened with warm water, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching subsides and the pain is alleviated. Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Then apply wool that has been soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, and bind it to the limb overnight until you are safe from heat swelling and the swelling subsides, and his pain goes away. Then return to gentle binding and a light dressing, but do not tighten it as you did initially.
Be gentle with him until he recovers. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have disappeared completely and you need to apply a bandage or compression, prepare it as you did initially, either way. If nothing happens to the part as we mentioned.
Do not remove it except after three, four, five, or seven days, or even leave it for twenty days, depending on what you observe about the condition of the part as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh begins to unite.
At that time, increase the compression more than your initial one and also increase the thickness of the patient's diet as previously mentioned. If you see that the site of the fracture has dried up and wasted more than it should, then know that nourishment is unable to reach it.
So soak it in warm water each time you remove the dressing, and do this every three days. Also slightly loosen the compression, as this action facilitates the circulation of nourishment to the part and hastens recovery. As for what ignorant splint-makers do, which is causing the limb to break again.
For if it does not set properly at first and sets crookedly, it is an error in their doing and a great deceit. Even if it were correct, the early scholars would have mentioned it in their books and followed it, but I have seen no trace of this from any of them whatsoever. The correct approach is not to act upon it.
The Second Section.
On Contingent Fractures in the Head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, and their shapes differ; their causes are varied. Some fractures result from a sword blow and may completely scrape the bone down to the subcutaneous tissue beneath the bone. As when cutting wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a coup-like fracture. It may also be that the sword cuts part of the bone but only scrapes its surface without penetrating through it; this type of fracture is called an avulsion fracture absolutely. The wound from these fractures may be either large or small.
There are fractures that are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow from a stone or falling onto a stone or something similar. This type of fracture may either penetrate nearly to the subperiosteal layer beneath the bone or remain on the surface of the bone.
The wound from these fractures may also be either large or small. There are also hidden fractures in the bone, as fine as a hairline crack, which is a minor concussion.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture. There is also a type of fracture that occurs from a fall or impact with a stone or similar object, where the bone surface indents inward, much like how a piece of metalware dents inward when struck.
This most commonly occurs in the heads of young children with soft bones. There may be loose or non-loose fragments associated with all these types of fractures, and we will discuss the treatment for each type in its proper place. We will identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Examine it with probes and remove the rotten flesh from it. As for the type that involves hair, uncover the bone and wipe and smear it with ink; then the fracture will appear black. As for treating fractures, first observe the symptoms of the patient.
If you notice clear signs of fear such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, severe fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient, for death is certain in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for the patient's safety, then proceed with treatment. This is especially so when a wounded person comes to you at the beginning of their injury, particularly if it occurs during winter days.
It is necessary to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day at all times, and if it is during summer days, it is essential to hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day so that what is under the bone, such as the membrane, does not rot, thus avoiding the appearance of the symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is also bruising and injury, it is necessary to cut the fractured and injured part as I will describe to you. This involves shaving the head of the wounded patient.
Expose the bone from whichever side is most convenient for you and according to the shape of the wound, whatever is easiest on the patient. If bleeding or a hot swelling appears when exposing the bone, deal with it appropriately.
This involves stuffing the area with linen soaked in syrup, oil, and rose water; cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is controlled, then proceed to shape and extract the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for one method, it involves cutting the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw, and this is its illustration:.
Then use another saw that is slightly wider than the first one, and this is its illustration:.
Then use yet another saw that is wider than the second one. It is essential to have several different saws, some broader than others and some shorter, with their edges being extremely sharp. They should be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use gentle blows on the saw to avoid shaking the head and harming it. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill holes around it before using the saws, with drills that are not deep, which they called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the thickness of the skull bone. These drills have a circular flange below their sharp head, resembling a ring or small circle, which prevents them from penetrating deeper than the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone. Ensure that you have a drill with an appropriate tip length and width for the thickness of each skull, and here are illustrations of three types. Of perforations, large, medium, and small:.
As for the method of drilling around a broken bone, it is done by placing the drill on the bone and turning it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another place, and after each hole, leave a distance equal to the thickness of a date palm or something similar.
Then, cut between each two holes using a saw as gently as possible, as we have said, until the bone is removed either by hand or with another tool from among those you have prepared for this purpose.
Use gentle instruments such as fine pitchforks and clamps, and be extremely cautious that the drill or cutter does not touch any surrounding tissues. Once you have carefully removed the bone and separated it from adhered membranes if they are attached to it, you should proceed with care to clean it thoroughly.
Smooth out the roughness remaining in the bone with another tool that resembles a saw but should be finer and more delicate than other saws. If any small pieces or fragments of bone remain, remove them gently using the instruments you have at hand.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other aspect of the work, it is extremely simple and free from risks; Galen mentioned it and praised it highly, as he said. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place one end of this cylindrical cutter underneath it. This is its shape:.
It should be smooth on the concave part so that it does not cut anything, and sharp on its sides extending in length as you see, so that the concave part rests against the abdominal wall and the cutting edge faces the bone; then strike the cutting part from one side.
Using a small hammer until all the bone is cut gently as it rotates, without any fear of damaging the membrane at all, even if the surgeon is the least knowledgeable and most cowardly person, yes, even if he is asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in certain areas, scrape it off with the rounded end of the cutting tool itself and gently remove it without causing harm or fear.
As for a bone fracture that has not penetrated the membrane, where only the surface of the bone is broken and there are rough edges and small fragments remaining, you should remove those rough areas and extract those fragments using delicate probes in various sizes so that you can use the most appropriate one for each situation as guided by your work.
And pay attention to the bone that is broken and its shape; you should use the widest of the probes first for scraping, then use one that is finer than the previous one. Continue this process progressively until you reach the finest and most delicate probe.
As for smaller hairline cracks and minor fractures, treatment should be tailored to what leads to their healing, which is something that is not hidden from those who have the least experience in this craft and have studied what we have written and explained about larger fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take a piece of linen cloth the size of the wound, dip it in rose oil, and place it over the mouth of the wound; then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil, then place it on the first cloth; do this as lightly as possible so as not to burden the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage from above but do not tighten it more than necessary to hold the wound in place only.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from inflammation. Then loosen it and use medicines that have a drying effect, such as the roots of saffron, cornmeal, fenugreek powder, zedoary, and similar substances. You should make these into a poultice.
Apply it to the wound as a dry poultice. In general, use a treatment that cleanses without irritating. Strive to ensure that your treatment of the wound is clean and free from any grease or dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it will damage and corrupt it, causing great harm to the patient. This may happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if proper treatment is neglected.
If there is blackness on its surface, observe if the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned; then know that he is surely doomed. Even if the blackness resulted from a medicine applied to it and this medicine has the power to cause such blackness.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, apply it to a cloth, then place the cloth on the affected area. Then treat it with various treatments as needed until it heals.
Chapter III.
On the repair of the nose if it is broken.
Know that only the upper part of the nose breaks, either entirely or partially, because it consists of two bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; however, it may be bruised, misshapen, or split.
If one side of the nose breaks, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and adjust the break from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and be careful not to cause pain to the patient by your actions.
If the break is at the top of the nose and cannot be reached with a finger, it should be adjusted with a bent instrument that is slightly thick. If the break occurs on both sides, do the same. It is best to set the nose on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, do this after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided. Then insert a thread made of cotton cloth into the nostril if the break is on one side, or insert two threads if the break is on both sides.
The thread should be as thick as it fills the nostril. Some early surgeons mentioned soaking the thread in fat and replacing it daily, but I do not see this as necessary. Instead, it is advisable to soak the thread in beaten egg whites mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the bandages until the bone is set and the cartilage stiffens, and you may insert into the nose for the bandaging goose quills after wrapping them in soft cloth to make it more constricting for a broken nose and so that the patient does not refrain from breathing.
This is not essential; if you wish, you may do it, or you can use bandages. If a hot swelling appears in the nose during your work, dress the nose with kerchief or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some ointment like diachylon.
If no hot swelling appears, it is advisable to dress it externally with semolina and fenugreek flour mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage on it, and do not bind the nose at all. If the bones of the nose are fractured slightly.
Or if they are crushed, it is necessary to incise them and remove them with the appropriate tool, then suture the incision and treat it with ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, it should be treated with bandages and lead tubes should be used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the reduction of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured but there is no accompanying wound, observe it. If the fracture is only on the outside and does not involve two parts and has not sunken inward, then identifying it will be easy.
It is appropriate, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and raise the hump of the fracture gently from inside to outside.
Use your other hand from outside the bone to control and straighten it. If the jaw fracture has split into two parts, it is necessary to use traction from both sides until it can be properly aligned. If there is a protrusion that has occurred in the teeth,
or if they become separated, tightly secure them with gold or silver thread or a wire until you expect them to remain stable. Then place a plaster cast on the broken jaw, and put a folded cloth over it. Place a large, firm splint or a piece of leather sole equal in length to the jaw over the cloth. Then secure it from above as you see fit, ensuring it is tight enough to prevent movement. Instruct the patient to remain calm and still, and provide soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day.
Then secure it from above as you see fit, ensuring it is tight enough to prevent movement. Instruct the patient to remain calm and still, and provide soft, easily digestible food. If you suspect any change in appearance, address it on the third day. Then clean the dressing with flour dust from a millstone mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the plaster cast. Place a soft bandage over the dressing. As long as this bandage adheres to it and there is no change in the condition of the bone, leave it as is.
Do not remove it until the fracture is healed and has become strong, as this often takes about three weeks. If heat or swelling appears during this period, use the methods mentioned repeatedly to relieve it until the swelling subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it; if a piece or pieces of bone have become detached, remove them gently with whatever instrument suits their removal. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel as needed.
Then, after removing those fragments and if nothing remains of them, outline the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for this purpose. And close the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of the broken shoulder blade.
The clavicle most often breaks from the front at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splits into two parts without creating fragments, which is the easiest to treat.
Or it may produce fragments, which is more difficult to treat. Or the fracture may accompany a wound. If the fracture occurs without a wound, have two assistants prepare: one to hold the arm adjacent to the broken clavicle steady, and the other to extend the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is proper and there are no protrusions or misalignments. If more extension is needed, place a ball of cloth or wool under the armpit of the injured person.
Adjust the ball under the armpit to the extent needed, extend and elevate the clavicle, and press on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward because it has moved inward, the patient should lie face down.
A pillow of medium height should be placed under his shoulder, and the servant should press his shoulder downward so that the clavicle in the depth rises upward. Then the fracture is set and smoothed with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should cut it open and gently remove that fragment. If the fragment is stuck in the bone, use one of the cutting tools you have prepared for such purposes. After placing the instrument that protects the intestines under the clavicle, which is made of wood or iron, this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon without a handle, and its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it should be according to what is convenient for the work. It should have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you can see.
If the incision made to remove a bone fragment is wide and you are not concerned about inflammation, then suture the edges of the wound. If the incision is small or you fear inflammation, dress the wound with bandages according to the size of the incision.
If there is inflammation, apply the incision with rose oil and vinegar or drink. If the bone fracture is without a wound or incision, then apply a bandage made from flour dust mixed with egg white to it. Place a soft padding on it, then place a ball under his armpit if necessary. Take a long bandage, about an inch wide, and wrap it around the padding and bandage. Then take a splint made of thin wood. Its width should be three fingers, and in length it should be the same. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth along with the splint in the part of the turban that covers the site of the fracture, then tighten the turban around the fracture as it turns. Support it around his neck and under the healthy armpit and under the affected armpit, and fold it several times on each side. And you know well how tightening it properly controls the fracture firmly, which is evident to you.
The main goal is that the splint should not shift from the broken bone. For this reason, you should check on the patient every day. Whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then make sure the patient sleeps on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
To raise his shoulder off his side so that the fracture of the collarbone rises with the elevation of the shoulder, or bind his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless an incident such as itching or swelling occurs in the area after twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a need for it. Tighten it and leave it until the fracture is set and becomes complicated. It becomes stronger and more solid in twenty-eight days. It may also occur in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a dislocated shoulder. The collarbone rarely breaks in its broad part; rather, it fractures at its edges. When any part is fractured or broken in the middle, this can only be determined by palpation. Treatment should be adapted according to the shape of the fracture.
Smooth and return it to its natural shape by whatever means you can, then apply flour dust mixed with egg white and soft adhesive on the area. Cover it with folded cloth bandages and place a wide splint made of wood over it.
Make the splint as wide as the shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, smooth out this depression with a soft adhesive so that the splint lies flat. Then secure it from above with a long headcloth.
Apply a firm bandage and ensure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandaging every day; whenever it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved out of position. The patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in twenty days.
In one day or twenty-five days, once this period is complete, remove the bandage with confidence, for it is among bones that are not feared to be crushed or fractured. If a bone shard protrudes and irritates beneath the skin, cut into it and extract the shard. And follow what was mentioned regarding the fracture of the collarbone to soothe any hot swelling that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
On the Healing of a Fractured Chest.
The chest may break in the middle, but this is rare. Its sides are more likely to break and splinter. If the middle breaks, it will tilt downward, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
It may also cause bleeding, and the deformation in the broken bone is evident to the senses. To set it, the patient lies on their back, a pillow is placed between their shoulders, their armpits are compressed, and the ribs are brought together with the hands from both sides, carefully aligning them as much as possible.
Continue until the shape of the bone returns to its proper form. Then, apply bandages and bindings, and place a splint made from a smooth piece of wood such as ash or lime tree, wrapped in cloth, on top of it. Then carefully secure it to the broken bone so that it does not move, passing the bandage around the circumference to the back several times and tightening it firmly. Check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it again.
If the need arises to loosen it when eating causes discomfort, pain, or swelling in the area, promptly loosen it and remove the bandage. Address any issues that arise with appropriate treatment, then reapply the bandage if necessary. And keep it tight until he heals.
Chapter Eight.
In the healing of broken bones, know that fractures occur in the thick parts near the back, while the front ends are subject to bruising because they are cartilaginous. This is not hidden from sensory perception when examining with the fingers.
To set them, align the fracture with your fingers until the shape is properly aligned, then bandage and secure the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If the ribs are fractured inwardly, it will cause severe pain to the patient.
And it may cause a sharp pain similar to that experienced by someone with a protruding rib, because the bone can pierce the membrane and also cause difficulty in breathing, coughing, and expelling much blood. This is difficult to treat, and early practitioners devised many clever solutions for it.
Some have said that the patient's diet should promote bloating and gas to inflate the abdomen, causing the fracture to move outward. We dislike this approach for fear of confirming the development of a hot tumor; if it has not yet occurred, it may induce its formation, and if it already exists, it will exacerbate and confirm it.
Others suggest placing a leech on the affected area and sucking strongly, which seems more reasonable except that it is feared the weakened area might be drawn in by the suction. Some say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
Bandage between the ribs until they are full, so that the bandage lies flat when wrapped around. Then treat the patient as you would for a protruding rib with diet and medication, but if severe exhaustion occurs, it may be too much for the patient to endure. The bone was piercing the membrane painfully, and we were concerned for the patient's well-being. Therefore, it is necessary to incise the area and expose the broken rib, then place under it the instrument that preserves the intestines which have been previously described, and cut the bone gently before removing it.
Then, if the wound is large, we sew together the edges of the incision and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this period, immediately apply bandages soaked in rose oil to the area and also treat the patient internally with remedies that reduce the swelling.
He should lie on the side that is more comfortable for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the Treatment of Spinal and Neck Vertebrae Fractures.
As for the bones of the neck, if they sustain a fracture, which is rare, but more often they suffer contusions. Similarly, this can also happen to the vertebrae of the spine. If such an injury occurs and you want to determine whether recovery is possible or not. Observe if his hands have become weak, numb, and lifeless, unable to move, stretch, or grasp. If you prick them with a needle or touch them sharply and he feels no pain, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases; he is doomed.
If he can move them and feels pain when pricked or touched sharply, then know that the spinal cord is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If a vertebra of the spine is similarly injured and you want to determine whether recovery is possible as well.
Look at his legs; if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened to the hands has also occurred in them, then when he lies on his back, gas and feces come out without intention, and when he reclines on his stomach, urine comes out without intention. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate but is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed; therefore, do not bother with his treatment. If none of this happens to him, then the matter is less serious. The treatment for what has occurred should aim to calm the hot swelling.
Place rose oil alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks on the injured vertebra three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening and drying bandages to the area, secure it with a bandage, and instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should not sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed. If a shard or something similar has come loose from the bone due to the injury, you must cut through the skin and remove that piece of bone. Then if the wound is large, sew together the edges of the wound and treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (tailbone) is fractured, you must insert your left thumb into the gluteal region.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as best you can, then apply a bandage or cast if necessary and secure it.
If you feel a shattered shard within it, cut through the area and remove it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Hip.
Bone fractures of the hip are rare; however, if they do occur, the fracture typically involves fragmentation at the ends, longitudinal splitting, and tilting inward. The patient experiences pain at the site, limping, and numbness in the leg on the side where the fracture occurred.
To treat it, pass your hand over it until you locate the fracture and determine its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, smooth out the fracture as best you can so that its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient face down so you can reduce and set the fracture. Once you have aligned it properly, apply a bandage and then place a splint made of wood or leather on it, securing it firmly.
Do not fear that the fracture will shift or that the splint will move out of place. Evenly pad the sides so that the pressure is distributed evenly, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on the uninjured side. If a hot swelling occurs, ...
Do not extend or manipulate the limb until the hot swelling subsides, and apply what is necessary to reduce the swelling as previously described. Then return to properly setting and securing it. If there are bone fragments or small pieces at the ends that have fractured, they should not be removed.
Do not disturb them; instead, smooth them out externally as we have said and leave them until they heal without further manipulation.
Chapter Eleven.
In the repair of a fractured humerus.
The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the top of the shoulder. If it fractures, it is repaired in one of two ways. One way is to take a curved, smooth stick of moderate thickness, as shown in this illustration:.
Two straps are attached to its ends, then it is suspended from a high place while the patient sits on a chair. Then, the injured arm is placed on the stick until the armpit rests in the middle of the curve of the stick. Then, something heavy is hung above it.
Or a servant extends it downward, then the physician aligns the fracture with both hands until the broken bone is properly set. The other method involves having the patient lie face down and suspending his hand from his neck with a strap.
Then, order two servants to hold above and below the fracture with their hands, one holding above and the other below. If you want a stronger pull, secure each side of the fracture with straps—one above and one below—and have each servant pull in their respective directions.
If the fracture is close to the shoulder end, it is necessary for one strap to be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, the straps should be placed at that location and on the elbow itself.
Then, align the fracture gently without violence until the broken bone is properly set and comes together well. If no inflammation appears, it can be secured; if heat and swelling appear, leave it unsecured until the seventh day. Place a soft cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it.
Until the swelling subsides, then apply it; the method of its application is to carry the bandage on the fracture, then place a wrap of new cloth over the bandage, then gather the arm on the same shoulder joint and place his hand open on his shoulder.
Carry the bandages and wraps on the shoulder joint and arm so that the arm serves as a substitute for splints, unless something prevents you from doing so, or if there is no change in the broken bone. If you fear any change in the condition of the broken bone, then use splints.
This means placing a splint directly on the fracture that is wider and stronger than other splints, with the space between each splint being the width of a finger. The length of the splints should be according to the length of the fracture, plus three finger widths on each side.
Then apply the binding method mentioned at the beginning of the chapter to the splints.
It should be that your binding is tighter at the site of the fracture.
The binding should be less tight as it moves away from the fracture. If you see that placing the splints and binding them as described when you are setting the bone is appropriate, then do so.
If you fear a hot swelling, then leave the binding and splints until the seventh day as we said. Then check the bandage every three days to ensure there is no itching, swelling, or obstruction of nourishment reaching the limb due to excessive binding. Adjust this as described.
If you are confident that none of these issues will occur, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days. The patient should lie on his back with his hand on his abdomen, and a pad filled with wool should be placed under the armpit comfortably.
Examine at all times, whether night or day, to ensure that the shape of the broken limb does not deform or that the ligaments do not become loose; correct all this with your efforts. Make the diet of the patient as we have recommended, so that it should be light initially until the bone begins to heal.
You should then make his diet heavier, for it is customary for the arm or leg to become strong in forty days. At that time, he should be released and used for bathing and treated with ointments suitable for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and crushed.
Do not release the ligature for fifty days or even up to two months,.
Chapter Twelve.
On the Healing of a Broken Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, known as the ulna and the radius. One is smaller and is next to the thumb, while the other is larger and is located below the smaller one. It may happen that only the larger bone (the ulna) breaks, or only the smaller one breaks, or both break together,.
When the upper smaller bone (radius) breaks, its healing is easier and recovery is faster. When the lower larger bone (ulna) breaks, the fracture is poor and recovery is difficult. The worst case is when both bones break together. If it is the bone where the upper smaller bone (radius) has broken,
The physician, when setting it, should make the traction gentle and gradual until it is aligned. If the larger bone (ulna) is broken, the traction should be stronger. If both bones are broken, the traction should be much stronger.
It is appropriate to place the hand in a position when setting and stretching it, extended on a pillow, with the thumb raised higher than all the fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient seated cross-legged.
And let the pillow be at the same height as him so that the patient does not strain himself.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends it from above in the same manner. Then the doctor aligns the bone until he returns it to the best possible shape; if there are fragments in the broken bone, they must be removed.
Place each fragment in its place to the best of your ability; if a free fragment appears that is piercing the skin and cannot be set, then cut it out according to the method described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have dedicated a separate section to it.
You should take the treatment for that from there; if a hot swelling appears at the beginning of setting the fracture, apply a bandage made of quilted fabric treated with rose oil and white wax, neither too thick nor too thin. Tighten the bandage gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the bandage and apply a dressing prepared from flour dust mixed with egg whites, then secure the splints. The splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Note that in most cases, the number of arm splints required is six.
Whether the fracture is in one ulna or both, make your binding stronger and tighter at the site of the fracture. Whenever you wrap upwards or downwards, make the binding looser slightly as mentioned earlier at the beginning of the chapter.
Let the patch that is wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not very hard. And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, medium between thinness and thickness as we have described, and examine the limb and bandage after days.
If something needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, it is necessary to soak the limb in warm water until the itching subsides, and then leave the limb unbound for a night to rest, after which binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, repair all of it to the best of your ability. Also, check if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding; in such a case, you should loosen it slightly and leave it for days until nutrition reaches it, then bind it again.
If nothing mentioned above occurs to the patient, it should not be removed until after twenty days or so. Then hang the patient's hand to his neck and let his arm be in a moderate position, and guard against erratic movements with all your effort, and have him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm is set in thirty days or in thirty-two, and it may be set in twenty-eight days; all of this depends on the conditions of temperaments and states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand and Fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges are rare, whereas contusions are common. When a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand,
The patient should sit upright on a chair facing him.
Then he places his hand on it, extended, and the servant extends the broken bone while the doctor aligns it until it fits well. At that point, the bandages and splints should be applied unless a hot swelling occurs; then a splint should be placed from above according to the location.
If it has been wrapped in a soft piece of cloth, and if the fracture is towards the palm at the bottom, then make something resembling a ball from cloth and have the patient grasp it with his injured hand, then bind it with a long strip of cloth.
Let the splint be made of leather that is flexible so that the skin can conform to the curvature of the entire hand, and secure it properly. If the fracture is on the outer side, then a splint should be placed from above and another from below the hand, so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then apply the bandage as the hand is wrapped and interlace the fingers with a ligature. If the fracture occurs at one of the phalanges, especially if it is the thumb, align it properly and secure it with the hand. If you prefer, you can make a small separate splint to stabilize the fracture.
Do not move it; if the fracture is in other fingers such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, then align them and bind them to the adjacent healthy finger or bind all of them together, which is better, or place a small separate splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, check for any hot swelling both during and after setting the fracture. Address it appropriately as previously described if such a condition occurs.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the repair of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is often fractured and can be easily detected by sensation because it moves forward and backward. Its repair involves securing a bandage above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying face up.
Then each bandage is stretched by an attendant in its direction with moderation. This is the case if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. However, if it is near the base of the thigh, a soft bandage made of wool or similar material should be applied.
Near the base of the thigh toward the groin so that the stretching is upward, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the stretching is downward. Then, the physician should straighten the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well. If this happens, the dressing and bandaging should continue unless a hot swelling occurs in the limb. If such a swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then return to treating it.
As for the bandaging, a broad sturdy turban should be wound around the fracture two or three times, leaving the excess. Then, bend the leg so that the heel is at the base of the calf and pass a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with both ends emerging above.
Then wind the remaining part of the turban around the leg and thigh. Place plasters over the fractured area on the thigh, and one plaster on the shin bone. Then stuff the space between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths to equalize the pressure.
Then begin with a strong binding from the middle at the site of the fracture, wrapping three or four times. The tighter you bind away from the site of the fracture, the looser and softer should your binding be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the splints above. Then pass both ends of the thread down until you reach the heel of the foot, and tighten them around the splints on the other side as well.
To prevent the bandage from shifting from its position, leave it in place as long as it does not cause any pain, swelling, or inflammation to the limb. If any of these symptoms occur, immediately loosen it and address all issues as previously mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a sharp fragment of bone that is causing irritation, it should be smoothed if possible. If not, then incise the area and remove the fragment, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture may also be immobilized from the thigh without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned for the forearm and arm, immobilizing it this way does not cause the patient to limp. However, if you immobilize it alone without adding the leg, the patient will inevitably develop a limp forever.
Know that the thigh takes fifty days or a little more, or a little less, depending on differences in temperament and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the Fracture of the Patella.
The knee joint is rarely fractured, but contusion occurs frequently. If a fracture does occur, it may be either a fissure or fragmentation of its parts, and this can happen with or without a wound.
You can determine all of this by touch. To treat it, align the dispersed parts with your fingers until they come together and unite as much as possible through careful and skilled manipulation. Then apply a bandage and if necessary, use a circular splint.
It should be securely bound from above in a manner suitable for this condition. Then, all conditions described in the treatment of other fractures, such as hot swelling and similar symptoms, should be addressed by treating each symptom appropriately until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the Treatment of Fractured Leg.
The leg has two bones: one is thick and is called the thigh bone, and the other is slender and is called the shin bone. Both are subject to various types of fractures similar to those that occur in the bones of the arm. Therefore, treating it is like treating the arm, and the procedure is the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg will be displaced in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the leg will tilt forward. If the thicker bone is broken from below, this should not escape your notice.
Use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly. However, if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the traction should be lighter and more gentle, and you must be careful and considerate in its treatment.
In the leg, there is something additional to do compared to the arm: when you have finished making the splints and completed all your work, take two handfuls of pine wood shavings which are used for smoothing the gaps between panels or can be from date palm leaves or similar.
Choose from them pieces that are slightly thick and not too thin, and make their length equal to the length of the leg from the knee to below. Then wrap two layers of cloth along each piece, one on the side of the leg and the other on the opposite side.
From the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the two handfuls in three places at both ends and the middle; with this binding, the leg will not tilt to the right or left and it will be properly secured. A gutter made of wood can also be used along the length of the leg.
It should be placed to keep it from moving, and this is particularly necessary when there is a wound with the fracture. Then check the leg every day with great care for swelling or any other signs of trouble. If any of that occurs, counter it as necessary until healing is complete. The bone in the leg will heal in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the Fracture of Leg Bones and Fingers.
As for the heel, it is never fractured. As for the bones of the leg, they may be broken, and fingers rarely break; in most cases, they suffer contusions.
If a man's bones are broken and you see that the bones are protruding against each other, let the patient stand with his foot on the ground as if he were walking, then place your foot on the part of the bones that is raised and press them down and even them out.
Until it returns to its proper place, then take the bandage and splint; place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot, then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloth and all other necessary materials.
After three or four days, loosen the ligature; you will find that the bones are straightened whether they were broken or dislocated. The treatment is as described. As for a finger bone fracture, set it and align it according to what has been described for setting fingers.
Then make a splint for the broken finger that runs along the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider than the finger. Also place the board under the foot as described to you and bind it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are broken, follow this procedure.
Make a splint for each finger, fitting it into a soft cloth bandage. Secure the board at the bottom of the foot so that each end of the board extends slightly beyond the sides of the foot to ensure proper alignment.
You should not forget to attend to all the symptoms we have mentioned for other fractures as well, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of a woman's pubis bone and the male genital bone.
When a woman's vagina is broken, seat her in a squatting position, then bend her slightly towards her back little by little. Then hold her from behind, and the midwife should stuff her vagina with cotton until it is full and resembles a ball.
Then shake the woman and lift her hips slightly by little increments; the cotton will come out until it resembles a ball at the entrance of the vagina, thus repairing the bone fracture. Then place a pad on her back; when she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she can urinate.
Return the cotton in the same manner as it was initially inserted, then return to her original padding. Do this for seven days or so, and the injury will heal. Alternatively, you may take a goat's bladder, attach a tube to its mouth, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vagina, as this will help heal the fracture. Stuff it with cotton and keep her in this condition for several days as described until she is healed. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use these methods to set it.
And its setting is as described for the hip bone. The proper approach to these rare fractures, which seldom occur, especially for those with some experience and understanding of this book, will not be hidden from you. Indeed, the fracture itself often provides guidance in most cases.
Follow the correct method for setting and securing it, so understand. As for a man who fractures his penis, if a goose's windpipe is broken and inserted into the penis, then wrap it with a bandage and bind it; leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
In the repair of bone fractures when there is a wound.
It is advisable for one who encounters a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur or humerus or similar, to act promptly and extract it at once if the conditions for extraction assist you, as we have mentioned previously.
If the wound is bleeding, it is advisable to act promptly by applying a powdered astringent if nothing else is available. Then proceed to set the fracture on that same day and do not delay it.
If a hot swelling does not occur, then proceed with setting it on the same day. But if a hot swelling does happen, postpone the setting until the ninth day so that the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for doing so would expose you to poor outcomes.
If the broken bone is protruding on the skin and exposed, it is advisable to gently attempt to push it back and smooth it out with your hands in a gradual manner. If you are unable to do so with your hands, use this instrument, which is made of iron and its length is about seven or eight fingers' width. And adjust its width to the size of the wound.
Therefore, it is advisable for the physician to have three or four of these instruments, depending on what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture. They should be rounded with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during work.
It should be sharp at the end, with a bend at its tip, and its upper part should be thick, while from the middle to the bottom it should be very thin. This is its shape:.
It is called in Greek "perne," meaning a small lever. Its sharp curved tip should fit onto the end of the fractured bone, and with it, you push the bone back once until it returns to some degree of alignment, then use it to smooth out the ends of the fracture so they fit together.
If the broken end of the bone is thin and cannot be securely grasped by the instrument, then you should cut that part of the bone so that the instrument can grasp it properly. If you are unable to realign the bone as described at all, then cut it in a similar manner using one of the methods mentioned.
Or smooth it with a file as much as possible, then remove any roughness or thin layers from the bone. If after realigning the bone the patient experiences severe and painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to realign it to its natural position, do so, as this will be a great benefit to the patient. Once you have properly set the bone, soak a cloth in a constricting black ointment, especially if it is summer, and do not place a cerotti or anything with grease on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and decay, then apply plaster casts after you have set the bone, and leave the wound exposed by cutting appropriate holes in the bandages with scissors over the site of the wound.
Beware especially of tightening the wound with the fracture, for foolish physicians often do this and cause either death or consumption or catarrh in their patients. Let your tightening be gentle and loose, contrary to the compression used for other fractures.
If the wound is poor or it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels anxious pain in that place, then you should not apply splints. Instead, make firm rolls from cloth in the place where splints would be used and secure them with bandages.
If after one or two days you see that the wound has begun to produce pus, then remove the cloth you placed on it with a solution, and then use bandages and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the quadratus ointment and similar ones. You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it is healed and cured. It is advisable to elevate the limb so that pus can easily drain downward. If many days pass and the wound does not heal and the pus continues, then know there are small bone fragments present.
You should examine the wound with a probe. Remove and extract those fragments that are clearly visible. For those that are not clearly visible but cause irritation and pain, crush and remove them in any way you can.
If the wound develops catarrh, consumption, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, you should treat each condition with a corresponding treatment as described in its respective section.
And among the things that you should pay attention to when I say this and keep in mind if a large bone is broken and you are dealing with a part such as the thigh bone or the upper arm bone and similar large parts, do not attempt to pull it out or extract it. Often, this leads to death, so leave it alone until it becomes gangrenous; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
At that time, treat the wound if you see an opportunity for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Complications That Occur After Some Fractures.
This complication often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially near joints, disfiguring the shape of the limb and sometimes preventing it from performing its natural function.
If you examine the complication and find it soft, use astringent medicines such as wormwood, frankincense, aloes, galbanum, squill, and similar ones. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent decoction, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply this mixture to the complication with effort and bind it tightly, leaving it bound for many days without releasing it. Then release it and repeat with another application until the complication subsides, God willing; or you can bind a sheet of lead securely over it.
Lead has the property of removing everything that remains in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and the necessity arises to remove it, make an incision at its top and cut off the protruding part or peel it off with some blunt instruments until it is removed, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
في علاج الكسر إذا أنقذ وبقى العضو بعد ذلك رقيقًا على غير طبعته الأولى.
إذا أنجبرت كسرة العظام وبقى العضو بعد ذلك رقيقًا ضعيفًا، فإنه يكون ذلك لأسباب كثيرة. أحدها إما لكثرة حل الرباطات وربطها على غير ما ينبغى، وإما لإفراط شد الرباطات حتى امتنع الغذاء أن يسري إلى العضو، وإما لكثرة التنطيل المفرط، وإما لحركات مفرطة في غير وقتها، وإما لقلة الدم في جسد العليل وضعفه.
وعلاج ذلك تغذية المريض وتخصيب بدنه حتى يكثر الدم فيه واستعمال الحمام وإدخال السرور عليه والفرح ونحو ذلك، ثم تحمل الزفت على العضو ليجذب الزفت غذاءً كثيرًا أو يدام تنطيله بالماء الفاتر. حتى يجري الغذاء فيه ويعود إلى شكله الطبيعي.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
في علاج العظام المكسورة إذا أنجبرت مائلة ومنعت فعالها كما ينبغي.
فمتىعرض لعضو قد جُبر بعد برءه إعوجاج أو نتوء للعظم المكسور أو تعقد وقبحت لذلك صورة العضو. Except that the organ has not ceased to perform its natural function, it is not appropriate to accept the claim that the organ should be broken from the root; many ignorant physicians and bone setters in our country used to do this.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risks, the least of which is damage. However, if the curvature and deformity are soft, it should be treated with water in which relaxing herbs have been boiled, such as nettle leaves and roots, chamomile, and similar substances.
It should be dressed with relaxing poultices such as well-made diachylon, or take the sap of nettle roots and mix it with chicken fat and butter to dress it with, or take fatty figs and pound them with pigeon droppings and similar medications called ulcer-breaking remedies.
The deformity should be treated with continuous gentle massage using the hands, and the movement of the limb in all directions at all times should be encouraged. If the curvature has become severe, hardened, and necessitates treatment with iron instruments.
It is necessary to incise it at the top, release the bone connection, and cut any excess deformity or bone with delicate cutting instruments, using care and effort in doing so. Then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its proper position, which impedes movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe pain to the patient. When it occurs in any joint, one must immediately attempt to reduce it back into place.
Do not delay it at all, for if delayed, the area will swell with a swelling that makes it difficult to return the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor moved, nor stretched while it is swollen, because this often causes painful cramps and distressing pains in the patient.
However, if this happens, one should immediately lance the patient and then leave it until the swelling subsides slightly. Then, the affected part should be treated with hot water and oil, and gently returned to its place. Each part should be treated as described in its respective section.
I have also arranged the sections on the jaw in the same order as previously described for fractures, from top to bottom of the body,.
The Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Lower Jawbone.
The jawbones rarely dislocate except in rare cases, and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they move slightly from their positions and become somewhat relaxed, or they completely dislocate and become fully relaxed. Toward the chest until saliva flows from the patient's mouth and they are unable to hold it back, nor can they close their jaw or speak clearly. As for a slight dislocation, in most cases it may return on its own with minimal effort.
In the case of a complete dislocation, it is necessary to quickly return it without delay. This involves one of the helpers holding the patient's head while the physician inserts his thumb into the base of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or he inserts all his fingers if both sides of the jaw are involved, and with the rest of his fingers from outside he aligns them, and he orders the patient to relax his jaw and move it to every direction, and the physician aligns the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to return it, especially if both jaws are involved, then use hot compresses and ointment until they can be easily returned, do not delay their return as we said. When they have been returned and aligned and the patient's mouth has closed without them relaxing, at that time place bandages on them made from wax and ointment that has been prepared.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back with his head propped up between two pillows so that he does not move to the right or left, and he should not strain to chew anything but rather make his food liquid and soft.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw heals, he should eat whatever he wishes but do so gently, and should not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is fully healed and he is cured.
If it is difficult to return the jaws when they have separated and do not return to their places, it often results in fevers, persistent headaches, and the patient's stomach may become upset, and he may repeatedly vomit. If you see these signs, know that the condition is severe.
And many die from this within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Reducing the Clavicle and the Tip of the Shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate inward due to its connection with the chest, but it can dislocate outward, and this can be perceived by touch. Its reduction is done by having the patient lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your hand; it will return to its place. Then apply bandages and splints and secure them. As for the tip of the clavicle near the shoulder, it rarely dislocates. If it does dislocate, it should be reduced and aligned as described and as you deem necessary.
Then apply bandages, splints, and secure them. Instruct the patient to rest and remain still until he is healed. With this same treatment, you should also reduce the tip of the shoulder if it has also moved from its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On Reducing the Shoulder Joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways. The first is downward toward the armpit, the second is toward the chest, and thirdly, it may dislocate upward above the shoulder, though this is rare.
It does not dislocate backward due to the position of the shoulder blade, nor forward due to the presence of nerves. It most commonly dislocates downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, as it can easily come out and go back in quickly in such cases.
As for those whose flesh is abundant, it is different; I mean that it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty. And sometimes some people suffer a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot, so they assume that it has dislocated. It should be examined until its condition is known.
At that time, proceed with its treatment. If the jaw is directed downwards towards the armpit, join between the dislocated and the healthy shoulder, then you will find a noticeable difference between them. You will find the head of the shoulder flattened and under the armpit, upon palpation, the head of the shoulder feels like an egg.
The patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear or to move it in all movements. Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that noticeable upon palpation and not hidden.
This dislocation can be easily reduced if the tissue is soft or the patient is a child. To reduce it, have an assistant raise their hand upwards, then place your thumbs under the armpit and forcefully lift the joint up to its position, while the assistant raises their arm and extends it upwards.
Then lower it downwards, and it will return quickly. If it does not return as mentioned above, and the dislocation has been there for many days, the patient should bathe in hot water and use a decoction that relaxes and softens, such as cooking the base of the large intestine, fenugreek, and rosemary in water to apply.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool is placed under the armpit, which should be moderate between softness and firmness. The physician then places the heel of the patient's hand on the ball and holds the patient's arm with his hand, extending it downwards.
He pushes the ball with his foot, and if he wishes to return it this way, then have a man taller than the patient stand beside him, and place his shoulder under the armpit of the patient and raise him up so that the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand down to his navel. If the patient is light, it is necessary to attach something else to him to increase his weight; then the jaw will immediately return. It can also be done in another way.
It involves setting a long piece of wood in the ground, with its end rounded like the head of a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin. Then place it under the patient's armpit after putting a soft cloth on top of the wooden piece, and have the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and also stretch his body strongly from that side; then the joint will quickly return to its place. If it is difficult to replace it using all the methods mentioned, use this treatment: take a piece of wood about two cubits long. Its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers. It should have a rounded end to facilitate easy entry into the armpit as shown in this illustration:.
Then wrap a soft cloth around the rounded end to prevent the wood from hurting the patient. Place it under the armpit and extend the entire hand and arm downward along the wood, then secure the wood to the shoulder, forearm, and wrist.
Then place the arm on a beam. Support yourself on the beam and extend the hand downward, leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side; then the joint will immediately enter. Once it is properly in place by whichever means possible, you should place an appropriately sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage mixed with dust from the mill, frankincense, and egg white is applied all over the shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball is tightly bound under the armpit and wound around the bandage from above, and his hand is tied to his neck.
It should be left so that he does not move his hand for seven days, and it is best to give the patient a small amount of food until the limb becomes stronger; this will speed up its healing. After seven or five days, it should be untied and he should train with movement. If it remains stable and does not weaken, then it has healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to excessive moisture or another condition, it is advisable to use cauterization with three sulfur applications as previously described in the section on cauterization. If after performing all of this and untying the bandage after seven days, the joint remains unstable.
And if you redid the bandaging and binding multiple times but it remained unstable, fell loose, and could not be raised above, know that the nerve in the shoulder joint has been severed or stretched or loosened. At this point, understand that the joint will never remain stable in its place.
As for the jaw that is toward the chest and breast and to the back, its correction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, and various binding and treatment methods are used until it heals. If after healing there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement.
Let the patient frequently use the bath to soften that stiffness and return it to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and it also returns with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, but especially to the front or back. Its dislocation is not hidden from you because it occurs within sight and touch, revealing whatever form it has taken.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the difference will be clearly apparent by examining the joint. The affected arm cannot bend, and it cannot touch the shoulder. You should act promptly and reduce the dislocation immediately before inflammation sets in.
If inflammation sets in, it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation, and it may never fully heal, especially if the dislocation is towards the back. Such a condition is the worst of all types of dislocations, causing severe pain, and often leading to death.
To reduce it if possible, a servant should extend both arms straight and grasp the upper arm. The physician should then place his hands above and below the elbow, using his thumbs or the base of his palms to push the joint back into its proper position.
If the dislocation is towards the front, it may be reduced by bending the hand once so that the base of the palm strikes the shoulder. If this does not suffice to reduce the dislocation, use a very strong traction: two servants should extend and pull the arm.
The patient should also be held by two servants to prevent movement during traction. Afterward, the arm should be moved in all directions, and it should first be wrapped in a folded cloth or a wide bandage. When the physician handles the joint with his hands, he should smear them with oil to facilitate smooth movement of the joint.
Then push the joint forcefully until it returns, and after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage containing substances that constrict and dry, along with egg whites, and bind tightly. The arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for days.
Then release it; if the joint remains in its place, remove the bandage and leave it alone. If you see that the joint has not become firm, reapply the bandage and leave it for days until it becomes firm, then remove it. If swelling occurs after returning the joint and releasing it.
If movement is difficult, use moisturizing in the bath, gentle massage, and tapping until it becomes soft. Or place a thick layer of fat from a large sheep on the joint, then bind it and leave it for a day and night, then remove it and have the patient enter the bath. When sweating occurs, gently rub the joint.
Then repeat the layering once, twice, and three times with entering the bath until it becomes soft. If you wish to apply moist cow dung mixed with fat and bind it tightly, do this repeatedly as it will soften and return to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the Treatment of the Wrist Joint.
The wrist often dislocates, and reducing its joint is easier than other joints, but it is necessary to reduce the joint immediately when it dislocates before it settles in a misaligned position or becomes inflamed.
Place the patient's wrist on a board, and have a servant extend his hand. The physician places his hand on the protrusion of the joint and pushes it until it returns, but it is necessary to check if the jaw has moved toward the palm.
Let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during stretching and pulling. If the jaw protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place his palm on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the same joint protuberance. If it returns immediately, otherwise bind it with a bandage to reduce swelling.
Leave it untreated as it cannot be redone, and you will not be able to return it after several days. Except that the joint remains in its position, which does no harm to the patient unless his hand relaxes and he is unable to grasp anything.
At that time, you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised; there is no remedy except cauterization, which may be helpful or may not help at all. Once the wrist is successfully reset, apply the bandage as described, then secure it and leave it for five days.
Then remove the bandage and train the hand. If its movement is difficult and stiffness appears, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the Treatment of Finger Joints.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. When a finger dislocates towards the back of the hand or its palm, extend the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns, then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it toward the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it aligns properly on its second day. At night, tie it in the same manner again; continue to untie it during the day and train it with movement, while tying it at night. Repeat this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it becomes detached towards the palm of the hand; tie it back toward the same direction and proceed with your initial treatment until it heals. Do this whenever it detaches in any other directions as well.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Treatment of Separated Spinal Vertebrae.
When a vertebra of the spine or neck becomes completely separated, or when many vertebrae are dislocated from their positions, there is no treatment for this, as death quickly befalls the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's excrement comes out without their control, and they are unable to hold it. Often, some of their limbs become weak, either their legs or one of their arms. If a single vertebra is dislocated from its position, it often leads to further dislocations.
It can dislocate in four directions: if it dislocates backward, it is called a hunchback. As for its treatment, one must observe; if the hunchback occurred during childhood, there is no cure and it will not heal at all. However, if it occurred due to a fall or a blow or something similar.
They have mentioned various treatments for it at length, but most of them do not yield much benefit. I have summarized what is essential from their lengthy discussions and have simplified the explanations to capture the essence. I have also illustrated the apparatus differently from how they have described and explained it.
I say that the hunchback which occurs from the front in the chest has no remedy and cannot be cured. The same applies to those on both sides. However, the one that occurs in the back is treated as I will describe, which is that the patient is laid face down.
Place the patient on a level desk near a wall, and spread a moist towel underneath him so as not to injure his chest. Then place an upright piece of wood embedded in a hole in the ground at one end of the desk by his head, and another piece of wood at the other end of the desk near his feet.
A servant holds the wood, and it should not be firmly fixed in the hole. Another servant holds the other piece of wood in a similar manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft but secure bandage, and extend one end of the bandage to the piece of wood at his head and tie it there.
Then secure with another bandage above the patient’s hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Gather all the ties together and tie them to the piece of wood at his feet. Then each servant pulls on the wood in their direction with the tie, but the two pieces of wood do not move from their fixed positions.
However, they are not firmly fixed as we said. The physician places his hands on the knot with force until it returns, or he places a board on it and leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board that is about three cubits long.
And dig into the wall that we said should be near the patient a place where one end of the board can be inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hunchback, and have the physician place his feet on the other end of the board and pull it tightly until the knot is compressed.
And return to its place, and if you wish to make it with a twistable rod, which is that you fix in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the board two pieces of wood whose length is an arm's length and at his feet at the end of the board also two pieces of wood.
And let there be a space of one span between each piece of wood, and make in each piece of wood a hole through which the rod passes, and secure all the wood firmly in the ground so that it does not move at all, and insert a round stick, which is the twistable rod, into the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end there is a hole secured in it with a stick of one span long, which is twisted, and in the other two pieces of wood likewise, then tighten the band that was tightened around the patient’s chest to the rod near his head, and the bands that were tightened around his legs to the rod near his feet.
Then a servant stands by each rod and twists his hand with the twistable part that twists the rod, and the physician adjusts the curvature as we have described. This is an image of the twistable rod, the board, and the patient:.
Then, after the vertebrae are returned to their place and the position is even, it is necessary to apply a plaster cast with egg white first, then bandages, and then place on top of the dressing a splint made of wood whose width is three fingers or so, and its length should be equal to the extent that covers the curvature.
And then it is placed over some proper stitches, and it is bound with the appropriate bandage. The patient should consume light food until he recovers. If some hardness remains in the area at the end of recovery, it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with using the described splint for a long time.
And a sheet of lead may be used for this purpose. And sometimes there is a lump at the end of the vertebrae, which might be mistaken for dislocation; it could be an extra bone that has grown, so do not treat it with this method, as death may occur.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint suffer dislocation only, and do not experience slight displacement or subluxation as other joints might. The hip joint can become dislocated in four ways.
It dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward. It most commonly dislocates inward, while dislocation forward or backward is less frequent. The sign of inward dislocation is that when you measure the patient's healthy leg next to the affected one, the affected leg appears longer.
The knee of the affected leg will protrude more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the knee. The area near the knee will be swollen and noticeably prominent because the head of the femur has moved there.
The sign of dislocation outward is the opposite of these symptoms. The sign of dislocation forward is that he can fully extend his leg without pain, but if he attempts to walk or bend it, he cannot do so forward due to pain.
He is unable to urinate freely, his knee is extended but weak, and when walking, he walks on the heel. The sign of dislocation backward is that he cannot straighten his leg or bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the arberry is relaxed, and the head of the thigh at the place of the side should be clear. As for responding to types of this dislocation, you must observe; if the dislocation is old and has been long with its patient without attempting to reduce it, and remains in that condition, then there is no treatment at all.
It is not appropriate to leave it untreated, and as for a recent dislocation of any kind from the four aspects of dislocation, you should immediately manipulate the joint, extending it inward and outward, moving it right and left, perhaps.
It returns without needing any other treatment. If it does not return in this manner, you should prepare a strong servant to extend his leg from below, either by hand or with a cloth tied above the knee, and another servant to support him from above.
By inserting his hands under the patient's armpits, then securing a flexible cloth at the top of the thigh. Another servant holds the end of the cloth and extends it either from the front, from the arberry to the collarbone, or from behind, towards the back.
They should all extend him at once until he lifts his body off the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns as we have said, otherwise, each type requires a specific treatment that I will mention.
As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then place a cloth around the top of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the arberry.
Then extend the ligament upward from the armpit to the highest part of the body toward the collarbone. Then another strong servant, aided by his arms, embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and pulls it outward very forcefully, for it returns to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment for returning this organ to its place. If it becomes difficult for you and the patient absolutely refuses this type of treatment, then you should bind both legs of the patient with a strong but flexible bandage around the heels and knees.
There should be a space of four fingers' width between each one, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two fingers' width. Then hang the patient from the head on a beam in the house, and it should be two cubits above the ground.
Then order a strong servant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another servant should hold the patient. The other servant should push firmly, and the joint will quickly return to its place. As for its specific reduction when it is dislocated outward.
The patient should lie on the bench as described for one with kyphosis, and the bandage should be secured around his affected leg and across his chest. Then place two boards, one at his feet and the other at his head. A third board should then be placed in the middle of the bench and firmly attached.
It has been wrapped with a wet cloth to prevent it from harming the patient, as the board is placed between his thighs so that he does not pull downward when being pulled. Then each servant pulls in his direction, and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands; if it responds by returning.
Otherwise, place the board on it and press it down as we mentioned in the case of kyphosis, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once they are in this position on the operating table.
The doctor places the palm of his right hand on the patient's calf, then presses it with the other hand, and extends the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be extended downward.
It should be elevated off the ground and placed on a solid surface. As mentioned, it should also extend outward from his nose to his hip according to how he lies face up on the operating table with the straps tightened.
As we said before, the pressing with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has dislocated. When the return of the hip joint is complete as it should be, and its return is not hidden from you, you will see that you can extend the patient's leg.
When you see them level and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then know that the part has returned as it should. At this point, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and bind it tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then loosen the straps and bandage and measure the leg against the other one. If they are even in length, then know that the dislocation has stabilized, so release the patient to walk. If you notice any slackening.
Return and dress it, and bind it as you did at first. Leave it like this for three days again. Then loosen it, and walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens, Insha'Allah.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Knees.
The knee dislocates in three directions: inward, outward, and downward, which means to the rear. It does not dislocate forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to draw his leg up toward his thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce all directions of dislocation, sit the patient with his legs stretched out if he can do so, and have a servant sit behind him to hold his waist and gently bend it backward slightly. Then sit on the patient's thighs.
Lean your back against the patient's face and place his leg between yours. Then hold his knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers around it. Firmly press the sides of his knee with your hands, and have another servant extend his leg until the knee returns to its proper position.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh gently without being forced. Then dress it and bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. He should not use it except for walking slowly for several days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to reduce it as described, then use strong traction with the straps that I have previously described for treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Heels.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward, and the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen and protruding in the direction it has dislocated toward.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it by gently stretching and aligning it until it returns to its place. However, if it dislocates completely, the patient should be seated, and a strong servant should hold him firmly from behind at his waist.
Then, with your right hand, grasp his foot from above and with your left hand, grasp it below at the ankle. Then pull the foot towards you twice with your right hand, then stretch it with your left hand, and push the front of the foot gently towards the leg with your right hand without force.
Do this twice as described, then in the third attempt, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the ankle. If it returns after one or two attempts in this manner and you see that the foot is aligned, stop; otherwise, repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return as described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a wedge in the ground between his thighs, wrapping it with cloth so as not to hurt the patient. Then have the servant control his thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg, either with his hands or by using a rope tied to the ankle. Both servants then pull in opposite directions while the wedge remains fixed between the patient's thighs to prevent the body from being pulled downward during the extension. Finally, the physician aligns the dislocation with his hands.
Another servant holds the healthy leg below, as the jaw will quickly return. When the jaw returns and you see that it has returned properly, take the bandage and ligature and secure them tightly with cords, and bind the foot with a cord below. You should be careful of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and does not harm him, then leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it again. On the third or fourth day, release him, and the patient must avoid walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is no guarantee that the jaw will not dislocate again and become irreparable, and it will not accept treatment afterward. If inflammation occurs, you should use what we have described in other places for treatment and drainage until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the Treatment of Dislocated Toe Joints.
It is necessary to realign what has become dislocated with a gentle pull, without violence, as this is not difficult but rather easy. If the dislocation is in one of the toe joints on the back part of the foot, it is advisable for the patient to place their foot on a level surface.
Or have the patient stand on a board as if he were walking, then place your foot on top of that joint and step down forcefully until it returns to its proper position and you see that it is straight with no lump appearing in the area.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that covers the entire foot, with two ends. Tighten it securely for three days, then release it but keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are assured there will be no recurrence, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
Concerning the types of suturing for wounds or fractures or both.
When any of these occur and one attempts to treat and repair them, they often lead to death.
Therefore, one should not attempt to treat such cases unless they are skilled in the art, experienced, gentle, cautious, and neither reckless nor overly bold. Initially, only medicines that calm hot swellings should be used, and the patient should be carefully observed.
Pray for a favorable outcome, except where you hope for recovery from the ailment due to its mildness and some hope becomes apparent; then immediately attempt to treat it at the very beginning before the hot swelling occurs.
If the part returns as desired, then use methods to calm hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments. If the suturing is for a fracture and there are splinters of bone that have become septic, then proceed to remove them. And follow in this what we have mentioned regarding simple diseases as described in their respective places.
Strive with all your effort and refrain from entering the path of risk, as advised previously. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your dignity, if God wills.
