of the abscess of the nail
A panaris is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers; and when it is old, and one does not take care of it, a hot abscess develops there, and spreads and emits pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and sometimes it runs all over it; and the corrosion reaches the bone, so that there is a foul-smelling pain, and the head of the finger is enlarged, and its color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment is not effective, then you must cut away with a knife all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards.
The cautery is very helpful if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy; and if the nail presses into the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must put the spoke under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards, and cut this flesh subtly and lightly, and put burning and corrosive medicines on the remaining flesh to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it and remove it, because as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal; and if you see the finger becoming corrupted, cut it at one of the joints as stated previously, then treat it until it is healed; and if it is struck and bruised, and there is great pain, then you must first reduce the swelling; then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, because the patient would feel too much pain; and if this happens, apply something soothing.
The pain of the whitlow of the hand.
The extra finger that grows on the hands of some men by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes there are some that have bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the base of the joint, or their origin is in some of the joints of the fingers.
The one that grows on a joint of the finger does not move, and the one that grows at the joint of the finger sometimes moves; cutting the one that is fleshy is easy, in this way: cut it at its base with a wide spatula.
The one that grows at the base of the joint is difficult to treat: therefore refrain from cutting it.
In the one that grows on the finger at the last joint, you must first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then treat it until it is healed. 
The fusion that occurs between fingers comes by birth, or by the healing of a wound, or by a burn from fire, or by similar things.
You must cut this fusion, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes; then place between them two tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not fuse again; or you put between them two pieces of thin lead, until the place is healed, as it should be.
If a fusion occurs in any of his fingers with the palm, cut this fusion as is appropriate.
