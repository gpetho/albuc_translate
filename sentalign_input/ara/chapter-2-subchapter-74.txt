On lancing the abscess that occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, abscesses, corroding ulcers, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor.  I have mentioned all of these diseases and their types and signs in the classification.
We should mention in this section the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus if it is among the tumors that collect over time how its lancing with iron is done. You should observe, if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And you see it red, if the sensation falls upon it, do not rush to lance it, and treat it with what helps it ripen until, when these symptoms subside, then you should sit the woman on a chair with two seats and have her lean back.
And she brings her legs together towards the lower abdomen and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are placed under her knees, and you tie them with a suitable bandage.
For this, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is opened, whose image will come later. It is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
It would harm the patient, so if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place supports on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary for the screw that runs in the instrument to be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the screw until the cervix opens. So when the abscess appears and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel when the entire period has been completed.
It is necessary to place in the wound a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, and the wick extends from the incision in the cervix, and on the outside, on the uterus and on the pubis, place clean wool dipped in water in which mallow has been boiled.
Then treat after two days with the ointment suitable for it until it heals.
The uterus and the wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it with what we mentioned in the chapter on incisions.
