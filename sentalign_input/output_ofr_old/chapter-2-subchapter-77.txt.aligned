Here follows the shape of the press, with which one squeezes the books; and it has two screws at the two ends of the two cords.	This is the type of instrument with which books are pressed. It has two screws at either end of two pieces of wood; but this instrument should be more slender than a book press, and should be made of ebony or boxwood.	0.66535854
However, the screws should be more slender than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood; and the mouth of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the shafts one finger, and a palm and a half long; and amidst the two cords, there should be two attachments of this same wood, which are fastened to one and the other, half a palm long or a little more; and these two attachments are inserted into the opening of the marrow to open it when the two screws are turned.	The width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers' breadth and the thickness about one, and the length a span and a half; and in the middle of both pieces of wood, firmly attached, should be two projections made of the same kind of wood, each half a span long or a little more, and two fingers wide or a little more. It is these two projections that are to be introduced into the vagina so that it is thereby opened when you turn the screws. Another instrument, for the same purpose, but smaller and lighter.	0.90003616
These instruments are all excellent, and their forms are multiplied; and when the physician has prepared them, the work is that much faster, and more valuable to people because of their quantity.	The more types of these instruments the practitioner has ready by him, the more rapidly he operates, and the greater his reputation among men.	0.68257976
So do not disregard the instrument without having it prepared, because the need for them is not excusable.	So do not neglect to have ready by you a single one of these instruments, for you will certainly need it.	0.6899812
