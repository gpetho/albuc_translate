Restoration of hip fractures.	On setting a fractured hip.	0.55991614
The hip bones rarely break, but when they do, the fracture is usually at the ends, extending lengthwise and inclining inward, causing pain and puncture in the area, and the leg becomes stupefied.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.7767944
The restoration involves extending your hand over the fracture to align it as it should be.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is.	0.4875011
If the fracture is only at the end, align it as much as possible until it resembles its natural shape.	If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.7465784
If the fracture extends lengthwise or inclines downward, have the patient lie on their belly until the fracture is prepared for restoration. Once aligned, apply plaster, then a wooden or leather splint, and tighten without fearing fracture puncture or splint movement.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.81130576
Fill any concavity to maintain even pressure, and advise the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.69524276
If an abscess occurs, stop extending and restoring until the abscess subsides; apply treatments to sedate it, then resume restoration and tighten as needed.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.79670453
If bone fragments are present or comminuted, remove them.	If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.5067488
