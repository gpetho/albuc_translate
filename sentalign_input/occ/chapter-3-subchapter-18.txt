Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pelvic bone and penis.
When the woman's pubic bone is broken, then make her sit in a square seat, and then incline her a little towards the back, and she should be held there.
And then the midwife fills the pubic area with cotton, and it should be made in the shape of a sphere; and then the woman should be shaken, and raise her back little by little, because all of this is pushed out until the front part of the pubic area is spherical and the broken bone returns.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and replace it and return it in the same way you placed it at the beginning, and then return to her original powder.
And do this for seven days or so, because that is the time needed for it to heal.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach to its opening a cane tube; and insert the entire bladder into the pubic area, and then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the pubic area, because the fracture will return.
And then fill it with cotton and let it stay for a few days as we have said, until it is healed.
And when the pelvic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in the restoration and alignment of it what we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures and which occur infrequently, especially to those who have some study and use and understand this book well; because that fracture shows you in the major dispositions a straight path in the restoration and alignment of it, so understand well.
But for the man's penis when it is broken, take goose grease, and place the penis in it; and then wrap it with cloth, and it should be bandaged, and then left for three days or so, and it will be healed.
