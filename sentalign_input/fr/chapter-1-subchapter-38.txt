of the bladder
When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, causing the patient to retain urine, make a cautery on the front part over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, each cautery as long as the width of a thumb; make one cautery on the back, or two if needed; and let the cauteries be clavile according to the shape mentioned earlier.
