When someone experiences acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes dim and small, and weakened vision, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these matters and this catarrh comes only from many veins, and the best treatment there is, is this one.

And it is that you instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another about an inch wide. And begin from the incision at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating; and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the incision and put there old cotton, and linen tents; then tie over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess; when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which make flesh regenerate.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare. Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion. When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh.	0.8544993
In this way: take two parts wheat flour, and four parts rosin, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to regenerate flesh everywhere.
