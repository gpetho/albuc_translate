of rheum/phlegm/cold
When someone experiences an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatment is not effective, then the last resort is cautery, along with cutting the two arteries.
It is necessary, then, when you intend to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then have the patient tighten their neck with a cloth; then look where the vein lies, and the location of both are behind the ears, and a little recessed; then mark the places with ink, then cut both with a sharp scalpel in two places, so that the cut goes down to the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, put the scalpel under the artery and cut it from above, cutting as you should, across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you must measure the distance of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut to the bone; and the necessary amount of blood to let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery; then examine the wound: if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind and dress the wound, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
