On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	1.0
You should know that the hip joint and the muscle joint only suffer dislocation, and they are not affected in the same way as other joints with slight displacement and concavity.	You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints.	0.84986097
The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: inward, outward, forward, or backward.	Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior.	0.822057
It is mostly dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.	Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.	0.90800506
The sign of inward dislocation is when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, which is swollen due to a severe abscess because the femoral head has moved there.	The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.	0.8822194
The sign of outward dislocation is that the symptoms are opposite to those of inward dislocation.	The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these.	0.7448719
The sign of forward dislocation is that the leg extends normally but cannot be bent without pain in the knee; if forced to walk, the patient cannot move forward, their urine is retained, the groin is swollen, and they walk on their heel.	The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.	0.8829738
The sign of backward dislocation is that the knee cannot be extended or bent forward towards the groin, the affected leg is shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the femoral head is at that location.	The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.	0.8573437
But the reduction of these types of dislocations depends on whether the dislocation is old and longstanding; if it has become chronic, the reduction and retention of it in its place is not effective, so it should not be attempted.	As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.	0.6622326
But if the dislocation is recent and is one of the four types, then promptly return the joint by extending it inward and outward, moving it right and left, as it quickly returns to its place and no further treatment is needed.	But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.	0.89510727
But if it does not return in this way, prepare a strong assistant to extend the patient's leg from below, either with their hands or with a band tied above the knee; another assistant extends the patient's arm so that their hands are under the armpits; then tighten a strong band around the thigh and have another assistant hold the end of the band.	But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage.	0.92598677
Extend the leg either inward towards the groin or backward towards the back.	Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine.	0.6528061
Extend all parts at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended.	Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended.	0.7722825
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocations.	This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation.	0.99451226
If the dislocation returns as we have described, it will be good; otherwise, specific treatments will be necessary for each type.	If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good. Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe.	0.860904
In the specific reduction for inward dislocation, the patient should lie on their healthy side; place the band around the thigh at the spot between the femoral head and the area below the groin; extend the band from the groin to the highest part of the shoulder.	When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle.	0.84719086
Then, a strong assistant takes hold of the patient's arms, supports the upper part of the affected thigh, and extends it outward with strong traction, causing it to return to its place.	Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place.	0.80424273
This type of treatment is easier and more effective for reducing this kind of dislocation than the other types.	This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb.	0.82313585
But if you are uncertain and do not follow this method completely, tie the patient's feet together with a strong, light band around both heels and knees.	But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees.	0.79289585
Each leg should be tied four fingers apart, with the affected leg extended two fingers more than the other.	The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other.	0.8750304
Then suspend the patient by the head of the post in the house; the distance from the ground should be two cubits.	Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor.	0.7171761
Instruct a strong young man to reduce the femoral head, and have another young man suspended with the patient, pushing with force so that the joint quickly returns to its place.	Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.	0.65913165
In the specific reduction for outward dislocation, the patient should lie on a cushion as previously described for the yellow disease; tightly wrap the band around the affected leg and chest.	The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest.	0.73431003
Place two posts, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; then place posts in the middle of the cushion wrapped with damp cloths to prevent the patient from being harmed by the post between their thighs, ensuring that the extension is not pulled downward.	Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension.	0.88813806
Each assistant extends their part, and the physician guides the reduction with their hand according to the art.	Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands.	0.6638602
For forward dislocation, the leg should be gently extended in the same way on a cushion; the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected groin, compressing it with the other hand, and with this compression, extends it downward towards the knee.	When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.	0.87188077
For backward dislocation, the patient should not be extended downward but lifted from the ground; they should be placed on a hard surface, as described for outward dislocation, lying on their face with the bands extended as previously mentioned.	If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before.	0.8516704
Apply compression with a board over the area where the joint protrudes.	It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.	0.69936967
When the reduction is properly done — the sign that it is successful is that both legs can be extended equally and the patient can flex and extend the affected leg without pain, indicating the joint has returned to its place — then adjust both thighs, apply a poultice and bandage tightly to keep the hip stable, and let the patient rest for three to four days.	When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days.	0.8724858
Afterwards, remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.	0.90086156
If the legs appear equal and stable, the dislocation is fixed, and the patient can be allowed to walk.	If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely.	0.70153606
If there is any sign of softness, reapply the poultice and bandage it tightly as before, and leave it for three days.	But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days. Then unfasten.	0.6825545
Afterwards, remove it and allow the patient to walk gradually over a few days until they are fully strengthened.	Then unfasten. He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.	0.6301183
