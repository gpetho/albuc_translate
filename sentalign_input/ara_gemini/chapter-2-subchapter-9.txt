Chapter nine on the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Often, something appears in the eyelids that resembles hail in its intensity and hardness, and therefore it is called hail.
It is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The procedure for it is that you look, and if the hailstone is prominent on the outer surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, then its treatment is easy.
Make a horizontal incision on it, then gently peel it from each side until it is freed, then hook it with a fishhook and cut it off.
And if you are unable to cut it off unless after piercing through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm the patient at all.
If the incision is large, then close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm in it for you, because the ointment will strengthen it and heal it.
If the hailstone is tilted towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and hook the hailstone with a fishhook without needing an incision, and cut it off from each side.
If it pierces through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm at all.
Then, after cutting off the hailstone, wash the eye with salt water and treat the area with something that heals until the patient recovers.
