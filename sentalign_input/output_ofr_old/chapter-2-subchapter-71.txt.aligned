Tentigo is an extra growth on the genitals, so much so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as big as a hand, and this is the treatment.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.55523074
You must hold the excess of the tentigo in your hand or with hooks, and cut it carefully; and do not go too deep, so that bleeding does not occur, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed; and there is another growth that arises at the opening of the uterus and fills it, and sometimes appears suddenly, and is similar in appearance to a tail, and therefore the ancients called it "tailed sickness. You must cut it, as we have said for tentigo, and treat it until it is healed.	You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off. Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur. Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed. As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.81661475
