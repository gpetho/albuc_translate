of the pustules of the penis Often these pustules come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; so you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then apply cotton moistened in Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.	These pustules very frequently occur in the urinary meatus and are excrescences of foul tissue. Some are malignant and some are not. The nonmalignant you should seize with a fine hook and pare away until they are altogether gone; then apply to the place cotton wool soaked in Egyptian ointment; then afterwards dress with Palm ointment until healed.	0.814751
And if the pustule is malignant, of a foul color and suppurating, then you must apply cautery to it.	But when the pustules are malignant, of a dirty colour, for these you should employ the cautery after cutting and scraping them.	0.729547
When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the tip of the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, you must first remove the pustule that is inside; and when it is joined, then treat the outside.	If the pustules be on the prepuce of an uncircumcized unbeliever and there are some inside the prepuce and some outside, those that are inside should be removed first; and when they are healed over, then treat those outside.	0.7926239
For when you treat it all together, the head of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come into the penis and into the testicle; so you must shave off everything that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made with pomegranate peel and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	For if you deal with both at the same time you are in danger of going through the prepuce. Sometimes there occurs a blackness and necrosis in the testicles and prepuce; then you should scrape away all the black part which looks ready to go necrotic or has already necrosed. Then afterwards smear on the place honey with pounded and sifted pomegranate peel and bitter vetch. Then carry on with the usual treatment until healed.	0.7630619
