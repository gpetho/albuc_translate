Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the pores of their ears not perforated.	Infants sometimes are born with an imperforated auditory meatus.	0.6153316
Also, some people may experience a blockage in the ear canal due to an injury or flesh growing in it.	Some people also get an obstruction in the passage of the ear, either from an injury or from flesh growing in it.	0.9138343
This blockage may be in the depth of the ear hole, imperceptible to sight. It may also appear slightly outside the hole and be perceptible to sight.	Sometimes this obstruction is at the bottom of the ear out of sight, but sometimes it occurs a little outside the passage and is invisible.	0.78807175
So the one that appears in the depth of the ear and is not perceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to see.	The sort which occurs in the depths of the ear and is invisible is, in general, difficult to cure.	0.7385336
And the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look into it. If you see the blockage apparent, open it with a delicate scalpel, which has this shape:	As for that which is within sight, set the patient's ear in the sun and examine it; and if you see that the object is something external you should make an opening with a fine scalpel like this.	0.75739306
Its tip should have some slight, limited width, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear.	Let its extremity be slightly broad, with a sharp point; while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear.	0.8823908
If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.	But if the obstruction be from flesh growing in the auditory meatus, catch it with a fine hook and cut it, with the utmost gentleness, till all the flesh is gone.	0.7732478
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with the patient's experience of hearing difficulty, rub it gently with the probe, being careful not to injure the eardrum. Then, place a wick in the ear, sized according to the width of the opening, having coated it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up.	If the obstruction be in the depth of the ear, take a fine smooth probe and warm it a little in the fire; then push it into the meatus. If you feel the obstruction (what time the patient will experience hardness of hearing), seek to perforate it gently, being careful not to injure the nerve of the ear. Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing.	0.9137584
Or, take a wick, moisten it in water, sprinkle powdered vitriol on it, and use it.	Or take a plug and dip it into water and sprinkle it with powdered vitriol and use that.	0.875893
If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have coated in a cerate made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then continue treating it until it heals.	If you perceive the ear swelling with an abscess you should remove the plug and put in its place another previously prepared by soaking in wax made with oil of roses, till the abscess has subsided; then dress till it is healed.	0.82227874
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding, as mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.	If a haemorrhage occur, dip a sponge or piece of material in cold water and put it on the ear, and apply the rest of the treatment to stop haemorrhage mentioned in the treatise on instillations.	0.90576434
