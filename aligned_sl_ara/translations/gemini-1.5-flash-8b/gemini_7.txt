The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is a complete part of the science of medicine, and having reached the peak of clarity and explanation in it, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application, by hand, is completely absent in our country and time, so much so that its study almost ceased, and its effect vanished. Only a few traces remain of it in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands and affected by errors and confusion, until its meanings were obscured and its benefit distanced.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter upon the path of explanation, clarification, and summarization, and to provide illustrations of cauterizing irons and other tools of the craft, for this is a means of increased clarity and a compilation of what is necessary.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with adept hands in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first undergo training in anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may understand the uses of the organs, their arrangements, temperaments, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their number and exits, arteries, veins, and their exit points.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of the hand. We have mentioned a glimpse of this in the introduction of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is liable to make a mistake that kills people, as I have witnessed many who presume knowledge and claim it without understanding or study.
For I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine-like tumor on a woman's neck, and severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled until she fell dead at his hands.
And I saw another physician, in extracting a stone from an elderly man, the stone being large, acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder's tissue. The man died about three days later.  I was called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the patient's condition that I could not have done so.
And I saw another physician who made his living by practicing medicine among some of the leaders of our city.
A dark-complexioned boy had a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly tightened the fracture against the wound with bandages and splints, binding it tightly and not leaving the wound any breathing space.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot swelled, and he was close to death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief and his pains lessened, but the damage had already taken hold of the limb, and I could not stop it.
The damage continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor. After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's suffering worsened. This is because if the cancer is purely of a dark, black humor, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety and work that is more often associated with injury.
And I have warned you throughout this book of all work that involves risk and fear, and you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak ill and criticize, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and in your treatment, gentleness and certainty.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure illnesses.
Keep yourselves free from anything that you fear might bring doubt upon your religion and your worldly life, for it is more lasting for your honor and higher in this world and the hereafter for your standing.
For Galen said in some of his precepts, "Do not treat a bad illness, and so call yourselves bad physicians.
This article is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization with fire and cauterization with a sharp medicine, arranged from the heel to the foot, images of the instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for manual work.
And the second chapter.
On incision, lancing, phlebotomy, cupping, surgeries, extraction of arrows, and similar matters, arranged and illustrated with images of the instruments.
And the third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and similar matters, arranged from the heel to the foot, and illustrated with images of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before mentioning the procedure, it is necessary to describe the benefits, harms, and temperament in which it is used.
I say that discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is lengthy, a precise science, and a hidden secret.  Many wise men have spoken on this topic.
Their opinions differed, and I have summarized their few words, fearing prolixity.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament, with or without matter, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, opinions differ. Some say that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others say the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry illness with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite claims that cauterization with fire can benefit from a hot, dry illness that arises in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say in agreement with him, because experience has revealed this to me repeatedly. However, one should not consider this matter except for those who have diligently and intensely studied the art of cauterization. And he who has understood the differences in people's temperaments, and the nature, causes, symptoms, and duration of illnesses.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear of them, and especially cold, moist illnesses. All physicians agree on them, and there is no disagreement on the benefit of cauterization in them.
Know, my children, that the secret of treatment with cauterization by fire is superior to cauterization with a burning medicine.  This is because fire is a singular essence whose action is limited to the affected organ; it does not harm another connected organ, except to a slight degree.
Cauterization with burning medicine can extend its effect to other organs, and may possibly induce a difficult-to-treat illness or even death in the affected organ.  Fire, because of its noble and esteemed nature, does not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service, care in the practice, and the understanding of the truth of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse, although, were it not inappropriate for this book, I would have presented to you a profound secret about fire, its action on bodies, and its removal of diseases, using a precise, philosophical, and demonstrative argument that would be too subtle for your comprehension.
Know, my children, that they have differed in opinion concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and have considered spring to be the best time.
And I say that cauterization may be appropriate at any time, for the harm caused by the time is absorbed into the benefit obtained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, necessary and severe ailments that cannot tolerate delay, lest a greater calamity should follow than the slight harm caused by the time.
Do not think, my children, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never return and you treat it as a blemish.
And the matter is not as you think, for cauterization is like a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humidity which is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is preferred to medicine because of its swift success, strong effect, and intense power.
The illness may return after a time, depending on the patient's temperament, the severity and strength of the disease, and the confluence of factors in the body, as well as their negligence in acquiring proper foods, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one, and in a part of the body with little excess moisture and humours. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, and similar cases, the pain may not return, which is the least that can be hoped for.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the final stage of medicine is correct, but not for the reasons they believe.  For they think there is no cure, neither by medicine nor otherwise, after cauterization; but it is different.
The meaning of "cauterization is the final stage of medicine" is that, when various treatments are used for an illness and those medicines prove ineffective, and then cauterization is used as the final recourse and it is successful, this is why cauterization is considered the final stage of medicine. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, because of the gold's moderation and the nobility of its substance. They said that the cauterized area does not fester, but this is not universally true.
Because I have tested this and found that it works in some bodies but not in others; cauterization with gold is better and superior to that with iron, as they said. However, if you heat a gold cautery in the fire, you will not be able to determine when it has reached the desired heat for the redness of the gold.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and is fused, and the craftsman is occupied with this.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is, in our opinion, faster and closer to correct practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, organized from the head to the foot, so that the student will easily find what they need, God willing.
The first chapter.
Cauterization of the head: one cauterization.
This cauterization is effective against the excess moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throats. In general, for every disease arising from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and stupor, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is first to order the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative medicine suited for the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-oil cautery, which is of this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of a bodkin's head or a carbuncle's size, raise your hand. Otherwise, reheat the same iron or another one if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as described, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in clarified butter and leave it there until the burning sensation subsides.  Then treat it with the four-component ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it produces, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the bone's thickness is burned.  Then the burned portion of the bone should be scraped away, and then treatment should be applied.
Others said that the cauterization should be intense, affecting the bone strongly, until it falls off like a small, flat piece of rock or a small disc. They claimed that it releases vapors from the head region through that area and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see either of these types of cauterization at all, except in some individuals and by way of chance.  I prefer to leave it alone, and with best wishes. For the head weakens when its natural connection is disrupted, as we have seen in other limbs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and with it you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head as well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head, and this has persisted in the patient, and if applying compresses, poultices, rubbing, ointments, and bandages have been used, especially if a single cauterization as we described has already been performed, and if none of these remedies have benefited, then consider... If the patient's head is strong constitutionally and not weak, and if they experience severe cold, cauterize again a little above the previous one. Then cauterize on each horn of their head a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is exposed to the extent we described. And cauterize a cauterization at the back of his head in the place known as the "axe" (or "battle-axe"), and be gentle in this one, and do not expose the bone; for the patient will experience intense pain, unlike the pain of the other cauterizations of the head; and I will mention this cauterization in its proper place.
The cauterizing instrument used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than that used for the middle of the head; this is its form.
Chapter Three.
In the cauterization of the chronic sister (or, the chronic cheek).
If pain occurs in the opening of the head, accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient be purged with purifying medicines for the head, and employ all the other treatment that I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If this does not work, then there are two ways of cauterizing in this case. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends on both sides. Then, split the painful area of the temple with a wide scalpel until a space is created under the skin large enough to accommodate the clove.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then apply firm pressure with bandages. Leave it in place for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Place a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter on it until the area becomes suppurated. Then, treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you wish, you can use some of the burning medications that I have given in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing with iron, it is done in this way: Heat the cautery iron, which has this shape:
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, having some grooves and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while slowly rotating the iron. The amount burned through the skin's thickness should be about half. And lift your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath, causing bleeding, then soak a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then bandage the cotton with oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this vein with the sharp, pointed end of the cautery, preserving the vein from cutting the artery in this particular, non-chronic vein.
Chapter Four.
Treating chronic veins.
If you have treated the vein using the previously mentioned treatments and the treatments mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment proves ineffective, and you see a cause that the aforementioned cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire cannot address, Then you should heat the sharp cautery until it whitens, having previously marked the site of pain with a line of half a finger's length or so, and let your hand rest once while tightening it until the artery is cut and you reach the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasms.
Be cautious and vigilant about the bleeding of the artery you have cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who does not know what to do and has not been a proven practitioner; abandonment of the procedure is preferable.
Treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in its appropriate place in the book, God willing, if you see a condition in the affliction for which this cauterization is insufficient.
If you see that the patient's body can endure it, cauterize a spot in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on ligating an artery with a double-bladed cautery; it is a superior and more effective cauterization than this one.
Fifth Chapter.
On cauterization for earaches.
If an earache due to cold occurs and is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, cauterize the ear with the cautery called the "point," whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply drops of it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Cauterize slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the location with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten dots in each ear, or thereabouts.  Then treat the affected areas until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing with a cautery.
The obstructions treated by cauterization are those resulting from phlegm, as I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve constriction.
If, having treated this type of obstruction with irrigations, emetics, and gargles, your treatment proves ineffective, then the afflicted person should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, for relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed in the image of a cauterization corresponding to the upper part of the ear, a little below the crown of the head, and another in the temple, with a length equal to the length of the thumb.
Apply the cauterization until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cauterizing instrument, which is a type of scalpel, a little gentler than the previous one, as you see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, and then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you have treated it as we mentioned but your treatment is not effective, and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one in the center of the head as we mentioned, and one at the back of the head, as previously stated.
The cauterization method, as previously described, may also involve a cauterization on the mouth of the stomach, which can be more effective, then treated as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On Cauterization for Forgetfulness.
One who has forgetfulness arising from phlegm should first be given large doses of purgatives and brain-cleansing herbs.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, several times; it is a form of cauterization.
And do this in the same manner as previously mentioned. If he is cured by this, then do not proceed further. Otherwise, apply three cauterizations to the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head down to the base of the neck.
Place the width of a finger between each cauterization, then treat the cauterizations as previously described. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize the temples, then treat him until he is healed. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general relaxation of the body.
It is necessary to first purify the head with the methods mentioned previously. Then, shave the patient's head, and cauterize one cauterization in the middle of the head, one cauterization on each temple, and one cauterization at the back of the head.
And three on the cervical vertebrae. If the ailment of relaxation of the body requires more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong and entrenched, cauterize four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply enough to burn most of the skin, then remove your hand, and treat him as mentioned previously, until he is healed, God willing.  Use an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with large syringes and with all the other treatment we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is large and can tolerate taking medications.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain many days beforehand, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head and apply one cauterization in the middle of the head, as described previously, and another in the back of his head. And on each temple, a cauterization.  If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize as described for paralysis and muscular relaxation, on the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, using an olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
In cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations that we have described for paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile, and the patient's body is moist, purge what purifies his brain as described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of flax like a circle, and place it on the center of his head. The patient sits upright and holds onto it from all sides. Then take one pound of aged sheep's butter.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate heat, so much that a finger can tolerate it when placed in it. Then pour it into the circle on the center of his head and leave it until it cools. Do this to the patient once a week along with the rest of his good treatment until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered points, without holding the cautery in your hand, but with a gentle touch.  This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in butter or chicken fat.
The Twelfth Chapter.
Cauterizing the watery discharge from the eye.
If you notice watery discharge from the eye, with the signs mentioned in the classification, immediately dry the patient's head and protect it from all moisture.  Have him sweat in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize the center of the head.  Cauterize the temples twice if the watery discharge is from both eyes or from one side only if it is from one eye.
Then, using the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin, ensuring the cauterizations extend lengthwise and across the temples.  Prevent bleeding.
If you see anything remaining, cut it at the site with whatever treatment is possible.  We will discuss in detail the wisdom of cutting the arteries and preventing bleeding.
He may also be cauterized twice intensely at the base of the skull, below the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and continuous, and originate from veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, and you are certain that it is due to a thick, cold, phlegmatic excess, cauterize it with the same cautery I described at the beginning of the descending water. A cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the temples, and two cauteries at the back of the head below the bones.  If more is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye's eyelid, at the edge of the eyebrow, using a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing nasal foulness.
If treatment with what we mentioned in the division is ineffective, then quickly apply cupping to the patient's head for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle portion with an olive oil cautery. Then cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery two points above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, being careful to avoid the artery, do not cut it. This is an image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, spaced apart from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be along the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization with your hand, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing it with fire, you instruct the patient beforehand to allow their eyelashes to grow long and even, if they are the sort who pluck them.
If it injured the eye while the eyelashes were growing, then bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so they do not move until they grow.  When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head on your lap, and mark the eyelid with ink, in the shape of a small leaf.
The mark should begin near the eyelashes. Then, place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or the juice of a prickly plant under the eyelid.  Then, heat the cauterizing iron – this is its image.
Then, cauterize in the shape you marked, little by little, in many applications, until the surface of the skin, which should all be visible in the shape of the small leaf, is burned. A sign of successful work is that you see the eyelid has shrunk and the hairs have risen from the surface of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days.  Then apply a cotton swab with oil until the scab comes off. Then treat with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after a while and the eyelid loosens,
Then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did at first.  If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not injure the eye. As for cauterization with the burning medicine, instruct the patient to allow the eyelashes to grow long and even.
Then make a shape of a small leaf from paper.  Then, take from the familiar soap and quicklime, one dirham or similar in weight of each, and thoroughly pulverize them both. Do this quickly so they do not dry out. Then spread some of this mixture onto the paper, shaped like the small leaf, and place it on the eyelid, either one or both.  Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and hold the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on top of the medicine and gently press it while moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, because it feels like a burning sensation. As long as the burning sensation is present, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look; if you see the eyelid has risen as it does when cauterized with fire or cut, then do not do anything further. If not, reapply the medicine to the areas where it has not taken effect and has not blackened, until your task is complete and the eye is cauterized.  Then apply cotton soaked in oil, so as to relieve the burning sensation.
Then treat it with the date palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You must be extremely careful during treatment, so that no medicine gets into the eye.  If the eyelid relaxes after a few days, and you are worried about something happening to the eye, [take precautions].
Then reapply the medicine to the relaxed part of the eyelid, specifically, as you did before, and treat it until it heals.  This is the shape of the small leaf (or, as is sometimes translated, the yarrow leaf).
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age; therefore, adjust your cauterization accordingly.  The correct approach is not hidden from one who has practiced this art.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the nasal discharge appearing in the eye's conjunctiva.
If you have treated the nasal discharge with the methods described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment has not been successful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the head firmly, preventing any movement or shaking.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the juice of a prickly pear on his eyes, and then heat the cautery iron—which is illustrated in this figure.
It should be hollowed out, like the shaft of a hawk's feather, on the one end where the cautery is applied. If you wish, the other end can be pierced, or if you prefer, it can be solid like a rod. However, the hollowed-out type is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the nasal discharge if it is open, and remove the matter and dry it; or if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.  Then, apply the very hot cautery iron to it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand a little further away from the eye towards the nose when applying the cautery, so that your hand doesn't miss the mark or the patient becomes agitated, causing the cautery to fall on the eye's eyelid and damage it.  If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then do nothing more. Otherwise, reheat the cautery a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with ghee and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply the strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it as described in its relevant chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the nasal discharge, mentioned by some earlier authorities, is to carefully cut open the area of the nasal discharge and then insert a thin funnel into the same incision.  This is its form.
Pour in lead, melted to the weight of a dirham, and hold the funnel firmly in your hand, ensuring the patient does not move at all, so that the molten lead does not drip into their eye.  It is necessary to place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the nasal discharge and heal it remarkably. If the nasal discharge heals with the cauterization and treatment described, then no further action is necessary.  Otherwise, a nasal perforation must be performed and the discharge returned to its nasal passage, as will be detailed in its specific section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, known as a fissure, often occurs, especially in the lips of young boys.  If the cleft, treated as described in the preceding section, does not heal, then apply a small, knife-like cautery iron in this manner.
Its [the cautery iron's] interior will be as thin as a knife blade.  Then, holding it hot, quickly place it into the cleft until the cautery reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with qirūṭī until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a nasal fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the flow of pus, and treatment is unsuccessful, then a cautery iron should be heated to a size that fits the fistula.
Then, introduce the hot iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold it until the heated iron reaches its deepest part, its end.  Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the matter is stopped and healed, well and good; otherwise, the area must be examined, and the corrupted bone removed, as will be described in the relevant chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Relaxed teeth and gums.
If the gums have relaxed due to moisture, and the teeth have shifted, and medication has been ineffective, then place the patient's head on your lap, and heat the cautery iron, whose image will appear later, after placing the tube on the tooth.
Quickly insert the hot cautery iron and hold it for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth; then, remove your hand.  Then, repeat the process with the cautery iron as many times as desired.  Afterwards, have the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The loosened teeth will become firm, the relaxed gums will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If toothache is caused by cold or worms, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with oil, take cow's oil and boil it in an iron ladle or a shell. Then, take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of the rod, dip it in the boiled oil, and place it on the aching tooth quickly. Hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  Or, if desired, dip wool or cotton in cold oil, place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, use a brass or iron tube, with some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth. Then, heat the cauterizing instrument, place it on the tooth, and hold it until it cools. Repeat this several times.
The pain will subside either that same day or the next.  After the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good oil, hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the shape of the cauterizing instrument.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, and in the way that is possible.  This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing pigs.
If pigs are suffering from phlegm and cold moisture, and do not respond to ripening with medicines, and you desire rapid ripening, heat the hollow cauterizing instrument, whose image is shown with both ends pierced.
To allow smoke to escape from the opposite end during cauterization, place it on the same tumor, once, and again if necessary, until you reach the tumor's depth.  If the tumor is small, make the cauterizing instrument the same size as the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cotton ball dipped in clarified butter to remove what was burnt by the fire.  Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-three.
In cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm predominates in the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxatives.  Then, a cauterization should be performed on the nape of the neck, at the base of the throat, in the lowest part of the area.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cauterization, and burn only half of the skin. Then cauterize again at the joint of the neck, at the last bead, strongly.  Use a nail-shaped cauterization iron, in the manner previously described.
Then treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and the patient does not have a fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, empty, low areas, and cauterize once in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cauterizing instrument should be a pointed one, as described previously.  If you prefer, the cauterization may be by dripping using a cautery known as the "point," the shape of which was previously described in the treatment of ear pain.  The number of drops should be from thirty to approximately that number.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he recovers.  A cautery with three prongs may also be used, in this manner, and hastens the cauterization, since with it you cauterize three areas simultaneously.  This is the design of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture or if it does not remain fixed when the dislocation is reduced so that it then dislocates again at the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint must first be reduced. Then the patient lies on his back or on his right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint dislocated inwards.
Then the double-pronged cautery, which is depicted in this image, is heated.
Then it is used to cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side.  The resulting cauterization pattern is four cauterizations; it may also be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery, in which case the pattern will be six cauterizations.  The prongs are placed along the direction of the affected area.
This is an image of the three-pronged cautery.
And one more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations. Then, pounded balls mixed with salt are applied to the cauterization. The patient must be kept at rest, and not move the affected limb for a time until it has strengthened.  If the dislocation is upward, it is rare.
Cauterize one good, nail-like cauterization or many small cauterizations above the shoulder blade. Then the joint will strengthen, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, disturbing its temperament, and frequent afflictions befall it, and if various treatments have failed, then the patient should lie on their back, with legs and arms outstretched, and three cauterizations should be applied. Apply one cauterization beneath the breastbone, the size of a fingertip, using a nail-shaped cautery iron, and two further cauterizations below and slightly off to either side of the first cauterization, so that the cauterizations form a triangle, maintaining some space between them to prevent them from joining if they become suppurated.  The depth of the cauterizations should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the cauterizations should be as described.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
The stomach can also be cauterized by puncturing.  For those who fear this cauterization, mark dots on the stomach to the desired extent with ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery iron, and then treat it with the previously mentioned remedies until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If the liver exhibits pain due to cold and dampness, or due to excessive and unnatural heat and the patient was treated as described in the classification, but this did not help. The patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries, of this exact shape and size, should be marked with ink on the liver, below the collarbones, where the human forearm ends.
Each cautery should be the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be performed straight, the length of the body. Do not press too hard with the cautery iron.
The burn should be no more than half the thickness of the skin, and no more. The patient should stand if possible, or lie down with legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may use a knife-shaped cautery iron for these cauterizations if you are skilled and careful, taking care not to over-cauterize and burn all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, as the skin there is thin. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
For cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know whether the tumor is in the liver tissue or its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will feel a heaviness and pain, but not intense.
But if it is in the liver's covering, the pain will be accompanied by intense sharpness.  If the physicians have exhausted their efforts in treating it, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, the cautery that resembles a spatula, and this is its form. Cauterize it with a single cauterization, until the entire skin is burned, and the cauterization extends to the covering, until all the matter comes out.  Then treat it as an abscess until it heals.
This type of cauterization should not be used except by those whose experience in medicine is extensive and who have treated these diseases repeatedly through experimentation.  Only then should they undertake such a procedure.  To leave it to me is better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zera'und in this manner: take one of the longest, driest roots of the zera'und, as thick as a finger.  Then dip it in oil and hold it over the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly inclined towards the area under the chin, avoiding the veins.  Two large cauterizations should be placed above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly tilted backwards. Another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach. Three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the loin, below the cauterization that is between the collarbones.
One should not penetrate deeply with the cautery, but rather apply it superficially to the skin, causing a slight burning.  Some of the ancients have written that some people used a heated iron instrument shaped like a spearhead, protecting it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
The pus will drain as we described for liver tumors, and in this case, cauterizing the abscess carries a risk.  Either the patient will die immediately, or a non-healing fistula will develop at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
In cauterizing the spleen.
If you have treated spleen disease as we have described in the classification and your treatment proves ineffective, cauterization can be done in three ways, all correct: one is to cauterize three or four times, arranged along the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations previously described, with the space between each cauterization equal to the thickness of a finger or slightly more.  Use the same cautery as described for liver cauterization. Do not insert your hand deeply into the cauterization, and the patient should be lying on their back.
The other method is at the elbow; raise the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends. Raise the skin across the width of the body so the cauterizations are lengthwise along the body.
Then, insert the cauterizing instruments, very carefully, until they pierce the skin on the other side. Then withdraw the cautery, resulting in four cauterizations; if you wish, use the three-pointed cautery instead.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing pus to collect for several days; this is more effective than any other previous treatment.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is helpful in hydrops of the abdomen, particularly. If you have treated the patient with the kinds of remedies mentioned in the section, and your treatment has not been successful, then you should cauterize four times around the navel, and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver and one on the spleen, and two behind his back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be roughly the thickness of the skin.  Then leave the cauterization open, allowing pus to collect for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient with further treatment after the cauterization, as is proper, so that the affected parts may quickly heal.  The cautery iron for the back is nail-shaped, as previously described, and that for the front is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they (the feet) swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron straight, do not bend it.  Then raise your hand and do not lower it again, for it will drain the yellow water.  The cautery iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg.  Use the sharp end of the cautery iron.  Cauterize along the length of the leg, one just below the knee, the other lower down toward the middle of the leg.  Cauterize each thigh, two cauterizations on each.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain.  Then treat it with the rest of the methods we have described.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing dysentery.
If the dysentery is due to cold and dampness, weakening the digestive and binding forces in the stomach and intestines, and if treatment has been unsuccessful, and you see the patient is strong enough to tolerate a cautery, cauterize his stomach with a large cautery. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron.  Apply four cauterizations around the navel using a fine pointed cautery iron, and cauterize the lower back area above the coccyx with one or two large cauteries.
If you observe excessive moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the pubic area, each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations near the larger one on the stomach. This is a sure and effective treatment, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the rectum.
If there are many chronic hemorrhoids in the rectum, or a single one, composed of thick cold humors or putrid moisture, and treatment as described in the previous sections has been ineffective, then cauterize the patient with three triangular cauteries on the lower part of the spine, slightly below the table.
And cauterize below the navel with a cauterization the size of two fingers.  If you judge that the patient's stomach is cold, and their food is not digesting, and you see their face swollen, cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described, and cauterize the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-like cautery. Leave the cauterization open for a time, then treat until healed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery, which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart, and press firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until healed.  If a large cauterization is made on the cotton, it is more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the buttocks and surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure described in its place, and recoils from it, perhaps he will be cured by cauterization.  If someone has a fistula that has persisted and pus and corrupt humors are discharged from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of its penetration with the probe, then heat the cautery iron, resembling a file, and insert it hot into the same fistula in line with the depth of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered. Cauterize it repeatedly, until all the corrupt matter is burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestines.
And be cautious of all these locations.  Only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge that it is not penetrative.  Then treat the area until it heals.  If the area seals over, the materials cease, and it remains so for a time, know that it has been completely cured.
And if the materials do not cease, know that it is penetrative, or there is a corrupt bone or something similar within its depth, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual function is diminished as a result, it is appropriate to cauterize the kidneys on the flanks, with a cauterization on each kidney using the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously.  Sometimes we cauterize a third time on the same spot, achieving three consecutive cauterizations, which is more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, such that the patient cannot control urination, cauterize the bladder with one cauterization below the navel, where the pubic hair begins, and another cauterization to the right and left of the navel.
After each cauterization, the cauterization should be the size of a thumb's width.  Cauterize the lower back, or two cauterizations if needed.  The cautery should be nail-shaped as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If the uterus contains a substance of cold and dampness, so that conception is prevented, or the menstrual flow is corrupted or painful, or if pain occurs during menstruation, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. A cauterization on the lower back, on the cotton, or two cauterizations. The cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous moisture may collect in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  A sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when the legs are measured against each other.  A hollow is found at the site of the dislocation.  A semicircular cauterization should be performed on the affected hip joint.
After marking the joint with ink in a circular fashion so that the joint is centered in the circle, use the cautery pictured in the stomach cauterization.  If this cautery is unavailable, use three cauterizations with the large olive cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach all the skin's thickness, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and the treatment described in the classification was ineffective and the condition prolonged, it is necessary to thin the thick humors with rotten seeds, prickly pear seeds, or similar remedies.
Then cauterize.  Cauterization has two types: either with burning medicines or with fire.  Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, like this image.
This creates a beneficial depth.  The distance between each cauterization should be roughly the thickness of a finger.  The cautery should be olive-colored.  One could also cauterize in the center of the hip joint itself, resulting in four cauterizations.  If desired, one cauterization can be applied in a circular manner, as previously described in cauterizing a hip dislocation.
The circle should encircle the entire hip and burn the entire thickness of the skin.  This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh, at the location of the pain indicated by the patient.  Cauterize once above the heel, approximately four fingers towards the outer side.  The cautery should be a pointed/slitting type, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize at the indicated location with a pinpoint cautery three or four times, or more if necessary. If the pain is below the knee towards the leg, cauterize with a single pointed cautery there.
In all your cauterizations, be careful not to cauterize so deeply that you burn a major nerve or artery, as this would inflict a serious injury or ailment upon the patient.
I have observed one and another who cauterized above the heel and overused the cautery, causing the leg to become swollen until it reached the foot, and the entire foot to ulcerate and rot, then diarrhoea and death followed. If the pain is in both locations, cauterize them using the same method.
Some wise scholars have described a hip cauterization using this method: a cup-like instrument is made of iron, with a diameter of half a span.  Its rim is as thick as a date stone, or slightly less.  Inside this cup, there is another cup, and then a third.
There is a space equivalent to the width of a thumb's breadth between each cup.  The cups are open on both sides and their height is about one or two thumb's breadth.  A handle made of iron is securely attached to the cups.  This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until red-hot and emitting sparks.  Then it is placed on the affected hip area, with the patient leaning on their healthy side.  Three circular cauterizations are made at once.  Then, the patient is left for three days, the wound is dressed with ghee, and the wound is left open for several days.
Then treat it with ointment until healed.  The author of this book said, "This type of cauterization is rarely used due to its harshness and frightening appearance, and few can endure it.  However, it is a good cauterization for those who can endure it, and for those who have it in the correct place.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it involves making two cups resembling the rings through which the hinges of a door pass, either of copper or iron.
Their height will be about two thumbbreadths or similar, and the distance between them will be about the thickness of a finger.  The lower and upper parts will be open, and they will be fastened together in this way.
Then place them on the affected hip area, the patient lying on their healthy side.  Hold your hand gently.  Then pour a little strong, heated water between the two circles. Hold it for about the time of an hour-glass. The patient must endure the sting and burning, for it feels like fire.
Until the stinging subsides. Then lift the instrument, and wipe the affected hip area with fresh water, removing the strong water.  Leave it for three days, and apply ghee until the black marks of the burn disappear. Leave it for several days to allow the pus to drain; this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.  If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for containing the water, similar to the one made for the hip. This is the description of the strong water. It is confirmed in the treatise on correcting medicines.
Take one part of lye and one part of quicklime, grind them, and place them in a new pot with a single small hole in the bottom, sized to fit the pestle. Place a separate glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the lye and lime until it covers them by a finger's breadth, after grinding them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the strong water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water, and pour it over fresh lime and lye, also freshly prepared.
It will then be extremely strong in its sharpness, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other parts of the body, for it acts like fire itself.  Some medications, such as safflower, balaذر honey, and lime mixed with soap, are ground and can also cauterize the hip.
Galen, recounting an ancient remedy for hip and sciatica pain, greatly praised it, claiming it requires no other treatment and heals in a single application.
Even, perhaps, a patient was carried into a bath and emerged healed.  This involves taking fresh green chiṭṭarīj; if no fresh green is available, use fresh dry chiṭṭarīj, grind it with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Then bind it tightly and leave it on for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Then take the patient to the bath.  When their body is damp, place them in a tub.  The pain will subside, and the patient will heal, God willing. If not healed, repeat the dressing after ten days.
He will heal, God willing.  Know that no one should use these cauterizing medications until the body is emptied. Dioscorides mentioned that goat's hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done thus: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow.  Then, take dry goat's hair.
Then ignite it with fire until it becomes a glowing ember, place it on the wool, and leave it until it dies down.  Then take another one and repeat this until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat's hair.
The Forty-second Chapter.
Concerning cauterization of back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from numerous causes, such as a fall, blow, excessive vomiting, and similar occurrences.  It may result from the accumulation of a cold, moist substance.  Cauterization is only effective in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, using substances like rotten seeds, one should cauterize the back where the pain is, making three rows across the table. Each row should have five cauterizations or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength, marking the area with ink first.
Cauterization should be done with a pinpoint cautery.  If desired, you may also use a medium-sized nail cautery, applying three or four cauterizations in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
In cauterizing the initial bump.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its onset in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and a bead-like protrusion appears at the end of the spinal vertebrae, standing out from the other beads.
If you see this and want to stop its progression, cauterize it with a circular cautery of this type. Apply the cautery to each side of the vertebra evenly. If you prefer, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery, in two or three rows.  Keep the pinpoints close together. Then treat the affected area until healed, using the methods described.
Avoid using cautery on a bump that results from nerve tension.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness that flows to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, physicians usually call it gout, specifically.
If the cold gout, the cause, is treated with the methods we have described in the classification, and the pain does not subside, cauterization will relieve it.  Cauterize the area around the joints of the legs many times after inducing vomiting.  Use a medium-sized olive-oil cautery in this manner.
And if it is necessary to apply small cauteries to the leg, do so with a pointed cautery.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, as often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with the same olive-oil cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, cauterize, but do not make the cautery too deep; it should only penetrate the skin's thickness.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in their respective sections.
If the pain is only in the hands, apply small cauteries around the wrists, in two rows.  If the pain remains in the fingers, apply a small cautery to each joint and on the palm of the hand.  If the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders after several days,
Cauterize them on both sides.  The patient must also receive good treatment and take medications.  If he improves his diet and expels phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
The forty-fifth chapter.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and bowels have descended to the testicle, and this is a recent onset, the patient should be instructed to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives to encourage bowel movements.
Then, have the patient lie on his back before you, and instruct him to restrain himself until the bowels or intestines are expelled. Then, push them back with your finger.  Afterwards, mark the area beneath the hernia on the pubic bone with a marking resembling a semicircle, its ends extending towards the upper body.
Then, heat a cautery iron – this is its form.
Until it becomes white and emits sparks. Then return the intestines or bowels to their place.  Afterwards, have a servant place their hand over the area to prevent the intestines from protruding.  Spread the patient's legs, and place a pillow beneath them. Another servant should hold the patient's legs together.
And another servant should hold the patient's hands on his chest. Then, apply the cautery iron to the same mark. Your hand holding the cautery iron should be held upright, and maintain the application until it reaches the bone, or repeat the process if it did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
Take care to prevent the intestines from protruding while cauterizing, so as not to burn the patient, which could result in death or a great injury. Understand that if the cauterization does not reach the bone, your effort will not succeed. The cautery iron should be appropriate in size for children and for adults.
Then, treat the cauterized area with ghee after three days, to alleviate the burning, then treat it with other ointments until it heals.  Let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is closed.
His diet during his treatment should be such as to soften his bowels, so that the intestines do not protrude when he evacuates.  Then, if he wishes to stand after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Reduce his exertion, and limit his intake of food, drink, and loud shouting.
If he follows this treatment, he will recover completely, God willing.  I will describe the treatment of hernias by incision in its own section, God willing.  As for a hernia that develops throughout the abdomen and is in its early stages, if you wish to prevent it from worsening, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery iron of the appropriate size. Let the amount of skin burned be about a third of the hernia's size. Then treat it as described above; it will not worsen, God willing. Some earlier scholars described cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery iron, in this manner.
After drawing a line on the hernia with ink, making the upper horizontal line of the hernia and the other line below it, place your hand in the middle to cauterize with a single, nail-like cautery. The initial cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in some limb, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medications, then the affected area should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron.  The cauterization of each limb should be performed according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
If the pain and fistula are relieved by the first cauterization, then the patient is cured. Otherwise, the cauterization should be repeated, as it is common for these ailments to spread from the affected limb to neighboring areas.  Therefore, cauterization should be continued until the patient recovers.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers may greatly benefit from cauterization, especially those with leprosy arising from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, examine the leper.  If the leprosy is in its early stages, and if treatment as described in the section on classification has been applied, and it has not worsened, or stagnated, and you fear the corruption may spread throughout the patient's entire temperament, cauterize the head five times. The first on the usual middle of the head, the second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind at the nape of the neck.  Cauterize thoroughly until a slight effect is produced on the bone.
Scales will peel off, facilitating the discharge of thick vapors, and cauterize the spleen as previously described.  If, however, the leprosy has persisted and become evident, then you should cauterize with the methods on the head that we have described. Cauterize the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on the cheeks, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the dorsal vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, another above it in the same area, and two on each thigh. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the collarbones, two on the elbows, two on the sides of the chest, and cauterize each joint of the fingers and toes, and each heel of the feet and the forearm of the hands.
And protect the nerve behind the heels from burning, and a cauterization can be performed on the pubic bone, another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective.
Know that the patient will not feel pain from the cauterizations as much as a healthy person, because the body has become numb.  The cauterizing tools should vary in size and shape, according to the organs and joints, as described in the characteristics of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed frankincense mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment until he/she is healed, God willing.
The forty-eighth chapter.
In cauterizing numbness. If a limb has become numb and has been treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings, but has not healed, then cauterize the numb limb with cauterizations appropriate to the size of the affected bone/limb.  Let your cauterizations be slightly deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Cauterization may also be used for some numbness that affects the hand or foot in the spinal vertebrae, at the exit point of the nerve that moves that limb, to remove the numbness.
One should not undertake this unless they are knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
The forty-ninth chapter.
In cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a small depth, proportional to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  horsetail leaves, and dove's blood or hookworm blood, one part of each. Mix all together, apply to a cloth, and bind to the affected area until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop its progression, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it moves.  Some scholars suggest a severe cauterization in the center; however, I do not recommend this, as I anticipate ulceration, and I have observed this many times.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.
The fifty-first chapter.
In cauterizing the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either due to the nature of its formation, or due to the patient's age (if the patient is elderly with low blood volume), or due to time, and you want to hasten the fistula's maturation, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations in a dotting pattern.
Then leave it; this will hasten maturation. If you wish to close it with cauterization, heat the cautery iron with the form shown here.
Place it in the center of the fistula until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be below, so that the pus can drain more easily. Then treat it with what is appropriate until it heals.
The fifty-second chapter.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are nothing but decay that ravages the organ, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron, consisting of many small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the decay is eradicated and nothing remains. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the decay are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh grows soundly, without any decay, then do not do anything further. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining decayed areas.  The ulcer can also be treated with a strong medicine.
For it serves the same purpose as fire, with quicker benefit.  I have already mentioned treating it with strong medicine in the classification; consult it when necessary.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a harsh, painful condition, often occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization can be done in two ways: either with fire or with strong, sharp water.
As for cauterization with fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery iron, similar to the wing of a griffin, fashioned from iron, that encompasses the nail on all sides and has a thin border. Then, bring the hot cautery down onto the nail and rotate your hand with the cautery around the nail until it reaches the nail's depth.
Leave it for three days, allowing it to suppurate. Then, bandage it with pounded wild thyme mixed with salt. Leave the bandage on for a night, and the nail will detach from its roots. Then, treat the wound with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals—if the nails are not inverted.
It frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  One should take a tube of copper, iron, or griffin's wing, and apply it to the nail or wart.  Then, pour a small amount of strong, sharp water into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand, rotating it and slightly pressing it, so that the tube's edge impacts the nail's root.  The sharp water will then penetrate to the nail's root.  The patient should endure the sharp water's sting for a while.
Then leave it; the nail will detach from its roots.  Do this one by one, until you have dealt with all of them on the body.  Afterwards, treat the affected areas with flesh-growing ointments.
Chapter Forty-five.
Concerning the cauterization of the scabies.
If someone suffers from scabies caused by cold in the nerves, or from quartan fever, or something similar, you should cauterize four or five times on the spine, between each cauterization, placing one on the chest. And cauterize his stomach with the olive oil cautery, for the scabies will subside and quickly mature the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-five.
Concerning the cauterization of the sores that arise on the body.
Ugly boils may arise on the body, caused by thick, corrupted cold materials.  When they first appear, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a burning stick, or the end of a long frankincense stick, or with a lens cautery.
And boils in their initial eruption may be cauterized in this manner.  Thus, the causative agent will not increase, it will dissipate, and the afflicted person will recover.  However, this must occur after the afflicted person has been bled.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the cauterization of bleeding occurring after an artery is cut.
Bleeding frequently occurs from a severed artery in a wound from the outside, or when a tumor or organ is incised or cauterized, and the like.  Cutting it off is often difficult.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger over the opening of the artery and press firmly until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes.  Then, take several small and large olive-shaped cauteries and heat them in the fire until they are very hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the location where the artery has opened, and apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger and holding the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding returns when you remove your finger from the artery's opening and the cautery has cooled, quickly take another cautery from the heated ones and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn the nerve, for this would cause another affliction to the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be severed, especially a large one, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; or it may be tied tightly with threads; or the drugs that stop bleeding and constrict with bandages may be applied firmly.
As for those who attempt to stop it by tying, or by constricting with cloths, or by applying burning things and similar methods, it will not stop that way, except rarely. If someone experiences this and no physician or medicine is present, then let them quickly place their index finger over the opening of the wound, as we described.
Press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and the artery.  The finger should not be removed from over it, keeping it continuously in contact with very cold, icy water, until the blood thickens, clots, and stops flowing.  During this time, observe what cauterization or medicine is needed.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, lancing, venesection, and wounds, and similar procedures.
Khalaf said:  We have already discussed in the first chapter all diseases in which cauterization with fire and burning remedies are appropriate, their causes, reasons, and instruments, and the forms of cauterization. We have made that into chapters, from the crown to the foot.
I will follow the same path in this chapter so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my children, that this chapter contains more potential for error than the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, the caution must be greater, for in this chapter, the work often involves the expenditure of blood, which is essential for life, when opening a vein, or making an incision on a tumor, lancing an abscess, treating a wound, removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar procedures.  All of these are accompanied by risk and fear, and death often results.
I advise you to avoid anything doubtful in this practice, for in this craft, you will encounter various types of people with various illnesses.  Some of them are weary of their illness and have little fear of death.
Because of the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, some show signs of impending death.  Others offer you their wealth, hoping for their health; yet their illness is deadly.  You should in no way aid those who exhibit this kind of desperation.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything of this sort unless you have certain knowledge of a favorable outcome. In all your treatment of patients, use profound knowledge and warn them of the possible consequences for their well-being.
For in this, you will find help in gaining praise, renown, remembrance, and thanks. May God, my children, inspire you with wisdom, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success; for that is in His hand, and there is no god but Him.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot.  This will, God willing, make it easier for you to find what you need.
Chapter One.
On treating the water that collects in the heads of young boys.
This ailment frequently affects young boys at birth if the midwife presses the boy's head roughly.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have seen this ailment only in boys, and all those I observed died quickly. Therefore, I have avoided treating it. I once saw a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head enlarged every day. Until the boy could no longer sit up due to the enlargement of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or underneath the bone on the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, a single horizontal incision should be made in the middle of the head, about two fingers in length, so that the moisture drains. This is the method of incision.
If the moisture is more extensive and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions, like this:
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign is that the sutures of the head are open on all sides, and water descends when pressed with your hand to the inside, this should not be hidden from you.  Then three incisions should be made in the middle of the head, like this.
After the incision, all the moisture will come out. Then, the incisions are closed with strips and bandages.  Then, it is bandaged from above with poultices and oil until the fifth day.  Then, the bandages are removed, and the wound is treated with ointments.  Do not allow the head to be constricted.  The patient should be fed with any dry food low in moisture.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to observe where the swelling bone and the collection of water appear, as it may be more prevalent in the back of the head, or the front, or on the right or left.
Therefore, aim the incision where the swelling and the accumulation of water are apparent, incising as best you can, being careful not to cut a vein, causing bleeding that will lead to the patient's death from such bleeding, along with the expulsion of the moisture.
The second chapter.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the *ḥassīsīn*.
If someone suffers from a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and medication proves ineffective, then the best treatment is the severing of these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to sever them, you must shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the artery.  Then, tighten the patient's neck with the help of their garment.  Then, look for where the veins pulse, and their locations, the two hollows behind the ears; rarely are they hidden, except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and sever them with a dissecting scalpel, completely to the bone. This should be done with the head in a presentation/exposed position.  If desired, insert the scalpel beneath the artery and cut upwards; the length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the artery is severed, blood will flow in a pulsating, forward, and continuous stream.  If the artery is not visible to the eye, one should measure from the ear about three finger-widths, then mark it with ink and cut to the bone; and what is necessary to...
Approximately six ounces of blood will immediately flow, sometimes more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it away.
So that a hot swelling does not appear, then bind the wound with a linen thread.  Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headache or acute ailments from sharp moisture and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headaches, and similar conditions, and treatments from the medical arts have not been effective, then we have tried, in these illnesses, to lance or cauterize the arteries of the temples, as described.
The procedure for lancing them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the apparent artery in the temple should be located.  Its pulsation will make it clear; it is rare for it to be hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if the cold is severe and it is not obvious, then the patient should tighten his neck with his clothes, and you should rub the area with a cloth, or apply hot water to the area until the artery clearly and distinctly appears. Then take the lancet which has this image. Then gently slice the skin with it until you reach the artery, and insert a probe into it. Pull it upward until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides.  If the artery is thin, twist it with the end of the probe. Then cut off a portion of it, sufficient to separate its ends and cause constriction, without causing bleeding. If it is not severed and not cut, the blood will not recede.  Then drain the blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread.  The thread should be either silk or bowstring material, so that the wound does not become infected before healing, and bleeding does not occur.
Then cut off the excess between the ligatures. Do this at that time or after some time.  If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a scalpel-like cautery, until its ends are severed, this will accomplish the same or better results as described.
Unless the patient has a fever or an inflamed temperament, because cauterization aids in the destruction of moisture, and is more beneficial.  After dissecting the arteries, the area should be packed with old linen and covered with firm dressings.  After healing, treat with dry medications that promote flesh growth and with compresses until healed, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, quickly stop it either by cauterization or by filling the area with alum and pressing firmly until the blood stops.  If none of these are available, use your finger to stop the blood.
Apply very cold water to the area until the pain subsides and it is properly firm.  Easier and less demanding than dissecting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the areas with ink.
Apply intense heat until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places, so the ends are far apart.  This cauterization will not cause them to join.  This is an image of the cautery.
The blades are sharp, resembling small blades, but much less sharp than a knife.  If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them more quickly and the flesh would not be severed quickly. If there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will remain there.
This quickly cuts the flesh.  This method is superior, easier, and less demanding than any other. The distance between the blades should be approximately the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
For the treatment of persistent, hot tearing from the eyes.
If the tearing is constant, and the discharge is from the veins on the skull from outside, and if nothing from medical treatment with drugs is helping, and you see that the patient's face has become red. He feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, like that of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges eroded and their eyelids glued shut by the intensity of the tears.  Early practitioners of this treatment, therefore, were driven to this procedure.  It is called treatment with the sword, and it involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, along its length.  Each incision is about two fingers long, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly spaced from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the opposite side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the contact of the jaws.  After each incision, there should be a distance of three fingers held together.  Have prepared sponge or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp double-ended scalpel, which is of this form. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, with it, all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone, is scraped away.  Then, do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove the scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a single-edged, sharp knife, with a smooth, non-sharp side.  This is its image.
Place its sharp side towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone.  Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes without reaching the skin's surface.
Then do this from the middle incision to the other incision. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of coagulated blood.  Then place a cotton wick in each incision, and put a dressing moistened with a mixture of oil and vinegar, or oil and vinegar, upon it.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, the ligaments will heal. Use copious lukewarm water compresses. Then treat it with Basil ointment, rose oil, and other remedies used for wounds until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharges from the interior of the head to the eyes.
When someone suffers from frequent, severe, persistent discharges, and the eyes appear weakened and small, and their sight is impaired, and the eyelids are ulcerated and the eyelashes fall out. And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then to make one incision in the center of the forehead.
And there will be a sharp, painful ache deep within the head, and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these fluids and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then to make one incision in the center of the forehead. Or to raise it slightly transversely, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be towards the bone, keeping your hand away from the movable temporal muscles during chewing.  Once the bone is exposed and all blood has been wiped away with a sponge...
Then separate the edges of the incision with absorbent cotton or linen thread.  Then press from above with compresses soaked in medicine and oil to prevent inflammation.  When you have resolved it and see that the inflammation is gone, you should rub the bone so that flesh begins to grow.
Then treat it with a desiccated preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts of a certain substance (likely a medicinal preparation) and preparing them into an ointment.  Use this ointment to encourage the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of things that fall into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic or semi-metallic stone, such as iron or glass; or a vegetable seed, such as chickpeas, nuts, and similar; or a liquid, such as water or vinegar, and similar.
Or if an animal, such as a stone or similar object that does not proliferate within the ear falls into the ear, face the ear towards the sun. If you see the stone, apply a drop of violet or siruj oil to it. Then try to remove it by moving your head or causing a sneeze with a catheter. Close the nostrils when the sneeze comes after placing a bandage of linen or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards.  Often this treatment will remove it. If it does not, then try to remove it with the gentle forceps which has this shape.
If it comes out with the forceps, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blunt hook. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that air has no way to pass except through the tube. Then pull it out with a strong pulling motion.  Often it will come out with this. If it does not come out with the methods described, then take a small piece of Nabataean gum or prepared gum, which birds are caught with, and place it at the end of the applicator.
After wrapping it tightly with linen, gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear has dried from moisture. If it does not come out with all the described methods, proceed to incision before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient in the temples, taking blood according to their strength. Then seat the patient before you, tilt their ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, at the lower part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then remove it with the best instruments you have. Then stitch the incision immediately and treat it until it heals.
If the object that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that proliferate and swell, try to remove it with the methods mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate scalpel, like this.
Try to cut that type of fallen grain in the ear with it, but only do this if you are certain that the grain has become moistened with ear wax until it is divided into many small pieces. Then remove it with a blind probe, a soft swab, or with suction.
As mentioned, it is easier to remove it.  As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use a bellows to induce sneezing.  They should first fill their ear with some old cotton while lying on the affected ear.  If it comes out that way.
Otherwise, take many small, smooth pebbles, warm them slightly over a fire.  The patient should insert one into the ear canal.  The patient should then stand on one leg, on the same side as the affected ear, and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water is removed.  Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and holding the other end over a fire until most of it is burned, and then using another feather.
Repeat this until all the water is expelled or use the tube as described for the pebble.  As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, like a flea or similar, treat it as described in the classification.  As for...
If it is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with absorbent cotton and forceps.  This is easier than all other ear problems.  As for removing worms generated in the ear, if treatment with what was mentioned in the classification in the chapter on earworms has not been effective.
You should examine the ear in the sun. If you see any worms, remove them with absorbent cotton or fine forceps. If you do not see anything, take a tube—this is its form.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.  Insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck vigorously.  Do this repeatedly until all the worms are removed. If this does not work, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned for the pebble.
If it is not removed by the methods described, then use the ear drops that I have mentioned.  The ancients have used them to kill worms, and you will find this in the chapter on ear drops.  You can use this instrument to apply ointments and medicines to the ear. This is its image:.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the tube inside the instrument can be made of strong copper, or you can take a thread and wrap it tightly around the end with cotton.
Then place the ointment, juice, or whatever medicine you want in the tube, while it is in the ear. Then, using the thread with cotton, gently squeeze with your hand until the medicine is driven into the ear and the patient feels it.
Have the patient lie inside, and whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly in the fire. Beware that the substance being instilled should not be extremely cold or extremely hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of ear obstruction.
Some children may be born from their mothers with their ear canals unperforated.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or growing flesh within it.  This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, and not visible to the eye.
Sometimes it may appear slightly outside the canal and be visible.  Obstructions deep within the ear, unseen, are often difficult to cure.  If the obstruction is visible, the patient's ear should be placed in the sun. And examine it. If you see the obstruction outwardly, open it with a gentle scalpel, in this manner:
Its tip should have a slightly limited projection, while the rest of the scalpel should have smooth sides so as not to injure the ear.  If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate forceps and carefully sever it to remove all the flesh.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient experiencing a dullness of hearing, gently rotate it.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum. Then place a wick, sized to fit the canal, coated with Egyptian ointment, in the ear.  Do this for several days until the wound is healed. Alternatively, soak a wick in water, and sprinkle powdered zeag on it.
Use it.  If you see the ear swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick coated in a preparation made from rose oil until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding described in the section on cauterization.
Chapter Eight.
On treating warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  One should grasp them with a scoop or forceps, cut them with a scalpel from their roots, then apply powdered alum to the area.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterization is better after the cutting, and it often returns if anything of the roots remains.  If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On treating colds affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold, both in intensity and hardness, often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid.  If the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, and moves in every direction, then it is easily treated by making a transverse incision on it.
Then gently peel it away from all sides until it is removed, then suspend it with a hook and cut it. If cutting it is not possible without piercing the eyelid, it will not harm the patient. If the opening is large, stitch it together and treat it until healed.
If it is small, there is no need to worry; the ointment will heal and close it. If the cold is inclined toward the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, suspend the cold with a hook without needing an incision, and trim it from every side.
If the eyelid is pierced by the cut, this will not harm it. Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold, and treat the area with something that will heal it until the patient is cured.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the pterygium that appears on the eyelid.
The pterygium is a membrane that is found in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It most often affects boys, weighing down their eyes and causing them to have colds in the mornings, and they cannot look at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them. Their eyelids are moist beneath the eyebrows, and they may have swelling. The pterygium is obvious. If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them.  The procedure is for the patient to place their head on your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and form a circle from that wick, encompassing the pterygium from all sides. Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the pterygium into the center of the circle.
Then, cut through the middle of that moisture with a lancet, a cut across. The cut should not be wider than a cut made in bloodletting.  As for depth, you must cut through the entire skin until you reach the pterygium.
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the cut like a white piece of fat.  You pull it outward with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand right and left, until it heals.  Beware of increasing the cut, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the pterygium does not appear at the initial cut, you should increase the cut slightly and gently until the pterygium appears.  Then, pull it out as we said, then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and apply it to the area, securing it with a bandage.  Some people crush salt.
They place it in the opening of the cut to dissolve any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the varieties of eye dressings.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course, beneath the natural lashes, and become thick, they harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and white discoloration and thickening, even causing the eye to become useless.
And the treatment of the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or the treatment is by cutting and stitching, or by using a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then do nothing; otherwise, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid, and pierce the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself.  Pull the thread upwards through the eyelid.
Turn it with a rod, then cut into the inside of the eyelid, away from the excess hair, using a sharp lancet from the larger to the smaller incision. Then, remove the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bind the eyelid with a bandage.
Like the shape of an artemisia leaf, but it should be shaped according to the amount of eyelid elevation you need, because it can vary from person to person. Some may need to cut a suitable amount of the eyelid, commensurate with the relaxation of the eyelid.
Some need a smaller cut, all depending on the relaxation of the eyelid. Then, cut with the lancet along the two lines you marked, starting from the larger incision to the smaller.  Each cut should be close to the natural hair, about the thickness of a rod.
Then, insert a hook into one of the corners of the skin and peel it all away. Then, bring the two edges together with sutures using a needle and thin wool thread, clean away the blood, and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
You may or may not do this; it does not matter. The sutures and threads remain for about three or four days. Then, treat it.  If you prefer, leave the wound unsutured and treat it with something that dries and constricts. The eyelid will rise when the wound is closed and brought together. Sutures are better.
This method of incision, mentioned by the ancients, is somewhat burdensome for the patient, but it is a good procedure and carries no risk. Another method of incision exists: to shape the eyelid like an artemisia leaf, as we described. Then, lift the eyelid with three hooks, either spaced apart or grouped together in this manner.
Then, trim away any excess eyelid with a small scissors in this manner, cutting evenly.
If you are unable to hold the hooks in place, or if the procedure is not successful, take a needle with thread. Insert it into the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger opening, and a third near the smaller opening. Hold the threads evenly between your fingers. Then, lift your hand with a steady movement.
Lift the marked skin completely, as described. Then, close the wound edges with stitches and treat it until healed. If a hot swelling appears after cutting or incision, reduce the swelling with *qirrot* and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges turn inward.  In this case, the methods described for cutting, stitching, and cauterization with a strong medicine or cauterization with fire should be used.  Cauterization with a strong medicine or fire is milder and easier on the patient than cutting and stitching.  Cutting and stitching are more difficult.
Cauterization with reeds is performed as follows: Turn the eyelid inside out and cut a slit as described previously.  Then, make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid and narrower than a scalpel's width.
Having notched their edges on both sides where the threads grip, gently gather them to the remaining part of the eyelid.  Tightly and firmly pull the reeds from both sides. Leave for a few days; the tightened skin will die, turn black, and putrefy.
Until it falls off naturally. If it takes too long, trim it with a pair of shears, then treat it until it heals. Once healed, the eyelid will lift, and the eyelashes will not prick the eye. This is the shape and size of the two reeds: [image/drawing omitted].
Chapter Twelve.
For removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If a hair or two are bothering, take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, tie the ends in a very gentle knot. Make the thread about a span long.
Then, tie another thin thread, shorter than the first, to the needle's eye.  If desired, tie its ends. The patient should place their head near your hand, close to the light, so the work is clear, as it's a delicate procedure.  Then, using the needle and thread, insert the thread into the root of the excess hair.
And carefully pull it through the eyelid until it emerges above the natural hair, then pull the thread upward, and remove the hair from the needle.  If there are one, two, or three hairs, remove them all from the needle.
Then, pull your hand to extract the hair along with the needle through the eyelid, alongside the natural hair. If pulling the needle doesn't remove the hair, pull the thread attached to the needle downwards to extract it from the top opening.
Then, reposition the hair in the needle and pull both. Repeat until the hair is high enough in the opening that you can see it clearly. Then remove the needle and thread. Compress the eye and leave it compressed for two or three days, until the hair is securely in place and tissue has grown around it.
If the hair is short, either attach a longer strand of natural hair to it, so they rise together, or let it grow longer and then remove it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of the stye that occurs on the upper eyelid of the eye.
The stye, which this stye is subject to, is called an arnbia.  This stye is either natural or accidental.  The accidental one results from the inflammation of a wound, cut, burn, or similar condition.
The procedure is to cut the inflammation, separate its edges, and place a linen thread between them, tying it until it heals.  One should not use things that dry and constrict in treating it.
For if you do that, the stye will return worse than before. Instead, use things that loosen it, such as fenugreek, soaked in boiled water and rosewater, flaxseed, and diachylon ointment mixed with some oils.  Apply this mixture to the thread and use it for treatment.
The aim of treatment is to prevent it from adhering in its original form by all means possible.  This method we have described is only a part of correcting the stye, not a complete return to the original condition.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On treating styes in the lower eyelid.
This stye that occurs from below is properly called a stye, and it is natural;  an accidental stye arises from a wound, cut, burn, or the like.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread, insert it into the flesh, piercing from the inner to the outer corner until the thread is on both ends of the flesh. Then, pull the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper form, well and good. Otherwise, take a spatula and place it on the site of the cut. Use it to turn the eyelid over and make two cuts on the inside of the eyelid, with the ends of the two cuts starting from the angles of the cut and meeting to form an angle. So that when they meet, the shape will resemble this shape.
Then, remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp side is lower than the eyelid, then rejoin the separated parts with two stitches of wool thread.  Then treat it with the relaxing and twisting remedies we previously mentioned until it heals.
If the fissure occurred from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, then a small incision should be made, also without touching the eyelashes, as previously described.  Then separate the lips with a twisting motion, as we have stated.
In short, for treating a fissure whether it is above or below, perform the procedure according to the appearance of the fissure.  For the fissure can vary greatly in appearance.  A skilled artisan, by whatever means possible, devises a solution.
Until the shape is restored to, or nearly restored to, its natural state.  The disease itself indicates the suitable treatment and tools to use in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its ease of movement and impeding its normal functions.  Therefore, a slender instrument should be inserted under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, one not as sharp as cutting scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slips and injures the eye with its sharpness. Your cutting should be as if you were peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion is healed. Then, instill into the eye salty water to wash it, or instill a solution of zinjari (a type of antimony) in water from a dropper. Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen thread.
And place over the eye a piece of cotton soaked in egg white. After three days, use medicated drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the toenail and deep flesh growths.
The toenail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a hard, white moisture that, if touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, breaks.
And a hook does not hold it. Both types begin from the largest part and gradually spread until they cover the eye and block light and eye movement.  The procedure for cutting them is that the patient places their head on a support.
Then, he opens his eyes, and you lift the eyelid with your hand.  Then, you grasp the toenail with a slightly curved hook, pulling it upward.  Then, take a needle, thread it with horse or ox hair and strong thread, bend the needle tip slightly, and insert it into the middle of the toenail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the toenail with the thread, pull it upward, and use the hair to peel the toenail's side towards the cornea, as if spreading it out with the hair to its end.  Then, cut the remainder at the base of the nail with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural nail flesh.
So that a constant flow of tears is not produced from its cutting.  The toenail may be pulled out with the hook alone, or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth blade peels the portion which is this image:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a rupture in the cornea and injuring the pupil.  Then, after cutting, place some powdered salt or zinjārī shiyāf in the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the toenail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook, this type of toenail is often treated with medicines and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image. Carefully scrape the toenail from above with it.  If you see that it is crumbling and only the scraping has taken effect, drop some zinjārī shiyāf or red shiyāf, or powdered salt, from your watch into the eye.  Hold the eye closed until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot swelling appears in the eye. Leave it, and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then resume scraping until it heals.  And concerning the protruding flesh (of the toenail).
If the protruding flesh causes excessive pain to the eye, attach it with a hook and cut off some of it. Do not cut too much, lest weeping occur. Then, instill red or zinjārī shiyāf into the depths until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the warding and excessive flesh that grows in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow until it covers the pupil or nearly covers it, or even extends onto the eyelids.  Sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure is to have the patient rest their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and use appropriate hooks to remove all the red flesh.
Or hold it with a lancet or forceps, then cut the flesh piece by piece until it is all gone, protecting the eye from harm during the procedure.  Your cuts can be made with the scalpel we described for cutting the toenail, or with small scissors. Like those used to gather splinters, as their image will appear in the next chapter.
Once you have finished cutting and all the flesh is gone, fill the eye with pounded salt or drop in red or similar corrosive medicines.  Place a white egg white compress on the outside of the eye to alleviate the inflamed swelling.
If any flesh remains and bleeding is excessive, causing you to fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it to reduce the swelling, then return to the procedure until healed.  Likewise, deal with any excess flesh of this type that appears in the eye.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by either natural means or by applying iron, and do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you see that the organ is suitable for the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the extraction of foreign bodies from the eye.
Foreign bodies are red veins that weave over the eye, hindering its function and weakening it over time.  Therefore, you must first examine it.  If the eye with the foreign bodies is strong and has no other ailment besides the foreign bodies.
Then, extraction is performed by instructing the patient to place their head on your lap.  Then, grasp the veins with one or two fine hooks, as your skill dictates.  The hooks should be flexible in this manner:
Or the hooks may be double-ended on a single piece, in this manner:
Then, delicately extract the veins with a fine pair of scissors.  Occasionally wipe away the blood until you see that the eye is clear of those veins and the blood has drained.  Take care not to injure the eye with the scissors' blades.  Work in the mid-day sun.
And be very diligent in your work so as not to cut anything other than the veins. Once finished, instill green or red cauterizing powder into the eye to consume any remaining foreign bodies.  If you were unable to remove all of them at that time, bandage the eye to soothe any pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and any inflammation has gone down. Then, repeat the procedure exactly as described until the patient is healed. This is the manner of using the scissors to remove the problem.
Leave it [and the patient's head should rest on the student's lap, and another student should wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye].  The essential method is to open the eye using a fixed or triangular instrument, held by a student.
Focused, and the patient's head rests on the student's lap, while another wipes away tears and examines the front and back of the eye.  You have the choice to begin extracting from the top or bottom of the eye.  It is better to remove two forceps from the upper eyelid, one at the back and the other at the front edge.
Hold it [the forceps] between the middle and index finger, then suspend forceps from beneath it. Then, hold the forceps between the ring and little finger, and slowly remove your hand so that you see all the foreign bodies raised.  If you desire, cut them out with small scissors; if not, with a gentle scalpel.
Insert the needle into the affected area and probe all the foreign bodies until they rise to the surface.  Do not cut or break them apart, as tears and blood will make it difficult.
Then cut with the scissors any part exceeding the edge, both top and bottom, so that only what remains on the cornea is exposed.  If possible, lift any that remain on the cornea with the needle; it is better, although in some cases this may not be possible.
If you cut it, a scab will form, relieving the pain and inflammation, then resume the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
Regarding the repositioning of the nasal septum.
If physicians treat a deviated nasal septum (nasus) with cautery or corrosive medications, as previously described, and it does not heal, the only recourse is to incise the tumor when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see damage or discoloration, scrape it with an instrument of this form:
The scraper, made of Indian iron, has a round head like a button, engraved with fine grooves like a rasp or a file. Place it on the affected area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while slightly clenching your hand, until you are certain that the damage has been removed.
Repeat this several times, then apply binding, drying medications to the area. If the area heals, flesh grows, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, pus, or any new problems.
Therefore, know that it is healed. If not, there is no other recourse but to return the deviated septum to the nasal opening in this manner: expose the bone again with a knife or a corrosive medicine. Once the bone is exposed, take a bone spreader of this shape:
The end of the iron instrument is triangular, and its shaft is a tapered, pointed cone as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, near the nostrils, keeping your hand a little further from the eye.  Rotate your hand with the spreader until the bone is pierced and the patient feels it.
If he finds air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose, then bind the area with drying astringent medications, as I have taught you.  If flesh grows and the area hardens, the material that had been protruding outward will return to the nose, which will be less of a burden on the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On repositioning the protruding eye.
If the entire eye has protruded, and there is no impairment or loss of sight, then the patient should be eased, then fastened in a sling.  Then, apply a cupping glass to the back of the neck, without any specific rules, and perform a gentle cupping.
Then, apply a compress made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and henna to the eye.  Then, bind the eye from above on the bandage with many thin strips.  The method for making these thin strips is to take a soft linen cloth, fold each piece into four folds, and make many of these.
Then, place these strips one on top of the other, as much as is needed for the eye. Then, bind them tightly with a strong cloth.  Reapply the cupping glass, cupping gently, without specific rules.  Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bound for one day and one night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened again.  Then, remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said. If you see the eye has returned to its place, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the bandage, the strips, the tightening, and the cupping until the eye returns to its proper position.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On cutting the conjunctiva.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, protruding and appearing outside the eyelids like a membrane, spoiling the appearance of the person, and you wish to cut it, proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the conjunctiva from below to above, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the tear, penetrating it, and leaving the first needle as it is.
Then cut the point where the doubled thread bends, tie part of the conjunctiva around the needle and tighten it well.  Then remove the needle and apply a cloth soaked in egg white to the eye, leaving it until the threads and the conjunctiva fall out.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  The conjunctiva can also be tightened from all sides with a circular piece of cloth to increase the eye's protrusion well, then use a thin scalpel to reach the depth of the eye, allowing the white moisture to drain, and the eye to subside and wilt in its position.  Then tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fistula.
This ailment, called fistula, is a fluid accumulation in the eye, resembling water that has descended but without the actual water.  The method of treatment involves having the patient sit upright on a chair, then holding their head with both hands at the sides.
And move it until you see the fluid descend to the bottom with your eyes, then hold it firm, so that it does not move, and the light emerges. The patient will then see objects as they used to. If the fluid does not descend to the bottom, we know it is water. If the fluid does not descend as described, then...
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision just above the cornea, where the adhering substance meets the cornea at the limbus, so that the matter may be expelled.
Then, after the expulsion, instill warm water, mixed with honey or water boiled with licorice and honey, into the eye, and then continue the treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already described the types of water for instillation in detail.  Follow those descriptions for the proper type.  Then, the patient should sit before you, squatting facing the light, near the sun.
Bind his/her healthy eye tightly, and then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if the affected eye is the left eye, or with your right hand if the affected eye is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cupping vessel close to the limbus, at the thickness of a date pit, on the white of the eye near the smaller corner.  Then, push the cupping vessel firmly, while rotating it in your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cupping vessel has reached an empty space.
The depth of the cupping vessel should be equal to the distance from the child's eyelid to the edge of the iris. The copper vessel will be seen by the observer, due to the clarity of the cornea, as though in the same place as the eye.  Then, move the cupping vessel upward to the location of the water.
Then press it downwards repeatedly.  If the water descends at once, the patient will see what has been revealed to his/her sight at once, and the cupping vessel is in the eye. Then, the patient rests for a little while. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cupping vessel.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping vessel gently, twisting your hand slightly. Then, dissolve some clean, refined salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then, apply moistened lint or wool to the entire outside of the eye.
With rose ointment and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye.  As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cupping vessel does not enter the eye due to its hardness (because some people have very hard eyes). One should take the lancet called the *al-bayrid*, which has this form:
Pierce only the adhered tissue with it, and do not overdo the piercing. Instead, lightly puncture the cupping vessel in a delicate place. Then introduce the cupping vessel as we have described. Once your work is complete, prepare a secure, darkened room for the patient to lie in on their back.
He should refrain from all movements and coughing.  His food should be easily digestible and he must not move his head at all, left or right. The bandage should remain in place for three days. Then, in that dark room, the bandage is removed, and his eyesight is tested.
Show him objects, then replace the bandage for seven days.  This should not be done during the treatment or after the cupping procedure.  Instead, avoid doing this until the moisture has receded quickly from intensive sight.
If a hot swelling appears, the bandage must be removed before the seventh day and treated to relieve the swelling.  Once the swelling subsides, the eyesight can be released, and a cloth is placed over the face, with something placed beneath to train the eyesight, for several days in the dark room. Then...
He gradually leaves the room and goes about his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the procedure multiple times before undertaking the work. I have heard from some Iraqis that they make a cupping vessel in Iraq that draws out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients.  It may be a recent innovation.  Here are the images of various types of cupping vessels for their understanding.
They are made of copper, specifically, and their tip is precisely this thin, triangular, sharp-pointed shape.
Chapter Twenty-four.
In treating flesh growing in the nose.
Various excess fleshy growths may sprout in the nose; some resemble scorpions with many legs, others are a cancerous, hardened, dark-colored flesh, and some are soft and not dark-colored flesh.
For those fleshy growths that are soft and not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, open their nostril, and insert a hook into the flesh. Then pull it out, and with a gentle, sharp scalpel, cut off what the hook has grasped from one side.
So that you know all the flesh has gone; if any remains that you cannot cut off, then carefully remove the remaining portion with one of the gentler tools, so that nothing of it remains. If bleeding is excessive or a hot tumor develops.
If it is a malignant tumor, act quickly and cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all flesh is gone. Then, after cutting, place vinegar and water or some other drink in the nose. If the nose opens and moisture flows into the throat.
Know then that he is cured. If the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is a fleshy growth inside, on the top of the porous bones, which the cutting instrument did not reach.  In that case, a thick linen thread should be taken.
Make many knots on it, placing each knot a finger's width or less apart. The patient should maneuver the end of the thread into their nose with a rounded object, or whatever means available, shaping it like a button. Pull on the thread to reach the nostril.
It will come out through the throat.  Children often do something similar in schools.  It is easy for whoever wants to do it. Then, bring together the two ends of the thread – the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then, use the knots in the thread to separate the flesh.  Do this until you are certain the flesh has been cut by the thread knots.  Then, remove the thread, and place the thread in the nose after cleaning the blood.  Soak it in Egyptian ointment for three days or longer.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh. Then, finally, a lead tube will be placed in the nose for some days until healed. If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the syringe used to drip ointments and medications into the nose.
A silver or brass vessel, similar to a small lamp, with an open container for ointments and a channel for its passage.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the syringe head flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when heating ointments or any other flowing substances.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing and enlarging over time, until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and remove the entire wart. Then apply either cauterization or a burning medication which serves as a cautery. If it is delayed and has grown large, consider if it is hard, stony, dark-coloured, and insensitive.
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that cutting this tumor has brought great harm to the patient. If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-coloured, and you see that it can be completely cut, then do so. Empty the ulcer and cut it off without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that if a separation occurs in any of these cartilages, treatment is rarely successful, except in some individuals.
Therefore, if one of these things occurs, examine if the wound is fresh and bloody.  If so, bring together the edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until healed.  If the separation has caused the edges to detach and each part is sound, then it is necessary to remove the skin from each part, to the depth of its visible thickness, until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with stitches, tighten them, and sprinkle powdered asafoetida and frankincense on them. Place a poultice of palm ointment, or other healing ointment, on top. Leave it tied for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medication and leave it until the stitches come out by themselves. Afterward, treat it with ointment until healed. The method of stitching is to bring together the separated parts either with needles, as described in the suturing of the abdomen, or with thread, as previously explained.
The Twenty-seventh Chapter.
On removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Small, hard tumors, resembling some carbuncles and others smaller or larger, may appear inside the lips of many people.  It is necessary to turn back the lip, and to cut open each knot and remove it with a forceps.
Cut it from every side, then fill the wound with powdered alum until bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt.  Treat the affected areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
The Twenty-eighth Chapter.
On cutting excess flesh from the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called *apōls*.  It should be grasped with forceps or a curette, cut at its root, and allowed to bleed.  Then, powdered alum should be applied to the area.
Or one of the astringent powders, dried. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does. Cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
The Twenty-ninth Chapter.
On scraping teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may darken, yellow, or turn green, and such decay can extend to the gums, thus disfiguring the teeth.
The patient should sit before you, head resting on your lap, and scrape the tooth, or teeth, that show scales and a sand-like substance, until nothing of it remains.  Likewise, treat the dark, green, and yellow discoloration, and anything similar, until it is cleaned away.
If the first scraping removes everything, then do not repeat the scraping. Otherwise, scrape the tooth again, a second, and third time, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that the tooth requires various scrapers, diverse in shape, according to what your task demands.
Because the scraper used for scraping inside the tooth is different from the scraper used for scraping outside, and the one used for scraping between the teeth is different again.  These are various types of scrapers, all of which should be available to you.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should treat the toothache with all possible means, and delay tooth extraction. For it is a noble substance and will not be replaced if extracted, so only extract it as a last resort.
Therefore, if the patient is determined to have the tooth extracted, you must first ascertain that the tooth is indeed painful. Often, the patient is deceived by the pain and believes it is in a healthy tooth, extracting it, only for the pain to persist until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this repeated by the actions of barbers.
If you are certain the pain is in the specific tooth, then you should cut around the tooth with a strong scalpel, so as to detach the gum on all sides. Then you must move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, little by little, to loosen it.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees, ensuring they are immobile.  Then pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and insert it underneath from all sides, gently and repeatedly moving it as before.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, you should fill the cavity with a cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, smooth instrument, to prevent it from breaking when you pull on it with forceps.  You should meticulously cut around the gum from all sides, thoroughly.
Use caution so as not to break it, lest a piece remain, causing the patient greater harm than the initial pain.  Avoid the methods of unskilled barbers who pull teeth without using the procedures we have described.
They often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, all or some of them. Or, the tooth might be pulled out with pieces of the jawbone, as we have witnessed repeatedly.  Then, after extraction, the patient should rinse the area with a drink, vinegar, or salt.  If bleeding occurs, which often happens, then crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum is ineffective, use the delicate forceps, which first move the tooth.  These forceps have long handles, short grips, and a thick build so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth. This is the image of large forceps:.
The handles should be thick, so that when grasped, they do not give way or bend.  The tips should be short.  Made of Indian iron or hardened steel, the tips should be firmly joined, with teeth that interlock tightly.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, and thus provide strong control.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of teeth and removing fractured jawbones.
If, after extracting a tooth, a root remains broken off, you should apply a cotton ball soaked in oil for a day or two to allow the area to relax, then use a probe or forceps. Those whose tips resemble the mouth of a bird called a bularge; this is an illustration of the forceps.
If it proves difficult to extract with these forceps, a burr-like or chisel-like instrument should be used to create an opening and expose the entire flesh with a probe, then introduce a small lever-like instrument of this type:
Short, slightly thick, and not tapered so as not to break; if the root is extracted this way, otherwise, use the following instruments, the first of which is triangular and somewhat thick.
Another delicate triangular image.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, also pictured here.
And with other instruments and tools, as previously mentioned in the inventory of teeth, we may also use this instrument resembling a large fishhook, whose image is this.
Triangular, bent, with a slight thickness to prevent breakage, and not tapered. Know that dental instruments are numerous, as are other instruments, almost countless.  A skillful craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to the indications of the work and the diseases themselves.
Because some diseases, due to their varied types, were not given instruments by those who came before, if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or decays, probe it in its location with a suitable instrument from among these instruments and forceps mentioned for extracting roots.
We use a file, whose image is this.
It should have some slight thickness to grip the bone firmly so that it does not slip out until the bone is extracted.  We treat the area with suitable medications. If the bone has a slight decay, remove the decay and discoloration until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the eruption of teeth that grow over others.
Teeth that erupt out of their natural order disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  If a tooth has erupted behind another tooth, one should examine it.
If it cannot be moved forward or backward, extract it.  If it is attached to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument, which is pictured as follows:
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian steel.  Cut it out over several days, due to the tooth's hardness and to prevent disturbing other teeth.  If it is protruding and firmly rooted, cool it with an Indian file, which has this image.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with a very finely engraved surface, resembling the file used to make needles.  Use it to cool the tooth gradually over many days, gently, to avoid dislodging it and causing it to fall out.  Then, finally smooth and scrape it with other scrapers.
If a tooth has broken, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture disappears, it becomes smooth, and no longer hurts the tongue or impairs speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In fastening loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If old teeth become loose and displaced due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat anything because they fear the teeth will fall out, and treatment with astringent remedies has been ineffective.
The remedy is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is preferable because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of intermediate thickness and thinness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread, insert its bend between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the sound tooth on the other side.
Then, reweave it back to the starting side, applying gentle and judicious tension so that the teeth remain completely stable. Tighten the thread at the tooth roots to prevent it from slipping, then trim the excess thread ends with scissors, gathering and twisting them together with a thread, concealing them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not harmed. Then, leave it like that, tightened, as long as it lasts. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread; and thus he can enjoy it for a lifetime. This is the appearance of the teeth and the method of fastening, in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth can sometimes be repositioned in their place after falling out, fixed as we described, and remain.  However, only a skilled artisan can do this.  They may carve bone from an ox, shaping it like a tooth, and place it where the tooth was lost. And tightens it, as we said, so that it remains and is enjoyed.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that is located beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament beneath the tongue may be natural, present at birth, or accidental, from a wound that has healed.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, hold their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, cut this nerve ligament transversely so that the tongue is freed from its constraint. If it has some firmness and complexity, and this is from a healed wound, use a needle and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
Beware of cutting too deeply into the flesh, severing an artery and causing bleeding.  Afterwards, the patient should rinse their mouth with rosewater or vinegar and cold water. Then, place a linen wick under the tongue for the patient to hold in place each night.
To prevent re-adhesion. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area. If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a suitable lens cautery. Then treat it with other remedies until healed.
Chapter Thirty-five.
Removing the toad generated under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may form under the tongue, hindering its normal function, and possibly growing to fill the mouth.  To treat it, open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the tumor.
If it appears dark-colored or black and hard, with no sensation for the patient, do not attempt to treat it, as it is cancer.  If it leans toward whiteness and contains moisture, use a forceps to pierce and split it with a gentle scalpel, and remove it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until complete removal, after which the patient should gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with further appropriate therapy until recovery.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors that grow in the throat may present glands inside the throat resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils.  If treated as described in the classification, but do not heal.
If the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not use the iron.  If it is red in color and thick in origin, do not use the iron either, for fear of blood loss.  Instead, allow it to mature, either by applying a poultice or allowing it to burst of its own accord.
If it is white in color, round, and has a thin origin, then it is the one that should be cut.  Before operating, observe whether the hot inflammation has subsided completely or if some reduction has occurred.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head resting on your lap, mouth open, and take a servant before you, pressing the patient's tongue downward with a tool, its shape is as follows:
Made of silver or bronze, thin like a knife.  If you press the tongue with this and the tumor is clear to your sight, then take a hook and pierce it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling out any of the membranes.
Then, cut it with an instrument, its shape resembling scissors, but with both ends curved, each having a sharp edge facing the other.  Made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, then cut it with a scalpel, its shape is as follows:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after the cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, he should gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or rue leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled until the bleeding stops.  Then treat it until it heals.  Other growths may appear in the throat besides the tonsils, and these are also cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a growth that had developed inside her throat, resembling a small tumor, almost blocking her throat.  She was breathing through a narrow passageway, and it had prevented her from eating or drinking.
She was close to death if she had lived another day or two.  Two branches had grown from the tumor, emerging from the nostrils.  I acted quickly, piercing one with a hook, and pulling it out.  A usable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I located it in the nostril.  I then did the same to what protruded from the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue down, and inserted the hook into the tumor itself, cutting off some of it.  Only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and ate.  We continued to cut away at that tumor repeatedly over a long period.  The tumor would regenerate after each cutting until the process lasted a long time for both of us.
I cauterized the tumor inside her throat, which stopped its growth.  Then I left the area and did not know what God did for her after I departed.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
In the cutting of a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, called a 'ʿunba', descends into the larynx and swells, being white and oblong, it is called a 'ʿamud'; if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an 'ʿunba'. If treated with the methods described in the classification, and the treatment is unsuccessful.
If the inflamed tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a solid, round mass with no length, and is dark red, dusky, black, or insensitive, then cutting should be avoided.
There is danger for the patient, so if you see it with the characteristics mentioned—its whiteness and length—the patient should sit facing the sun, the tongue pressed down with the instrument previously described, and then the snare should be inserted into the ʿunba.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on cutting the tonsils.  Only the part exceeding the natural limit should be cut, no more; for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
After the cutting, use the treatment described for the tonsils and treat it until it is healed. If the patient is reluctant to have it cut, use the cauterization method without fear or caution. The cauterization is done using a sharp medicine; place the patient's head on your lap.
Then, press the patient's tongue down with the instrument mentioned, then take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime (unquenched), making a paste neither thick nor thin. Fill the cavity of this instrument; this is its shape:
Its tip, where you place the medicine, should have a depression like that of a date-pitting spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the throat itself, with the patient lying on his side so that saliva flows out of his mouth from inside his throat, to prevent anything from flowing back down into the throat and harming him.
Then hold the medicine in your hand, pressing it against the throat for about half an hour until you see it has blackened and the burning sensation of the medicine subsides.  Alternatively, you can take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a date-pitting spoon, and soak it in the medicine.
Insert the spoon with the cotton into the tube from above so that the cotton adheres to the throat.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired level of cauterization of the ulcer.  Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe the area around the ulcer with cotton soaked in ghee, removing any remaining medicine. Then, the patient should rinse with cold water, and be treated externally with lotions and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less frightening.
The throat can also be treated with gentler methods than cauterization or cutting, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, saffron, savory, bistort, wormwood, chamomile, and rue, or similar herbs.  Gather them all or some of them in a pot and soak them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, with the pot covered with clay of wisdom.  A hollowed-out instrument, made of silver or copper, should have a hole in the center of the lid.
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the throat through the tube, causing the throat to contract.  Repeat this several times until it withers.  Take care not to use this treatment at the very beginning of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Instead, it should be done when the inflamed swelling has subsided.  If this instrument is not available, take a hollow reed and place an egg shell at its end to prevent the patient's mouth from burning.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth.  This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
For removing thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone, or something similar, becomes lodged in the throat.  It is necessary to remove any visible object that can be seen by the eye, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the light of the sun.
To make clear what is in the throat.  If something is hidden and not visible in the throat, it is necessary to induce vomiting in the patient before their food is digested in the stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will be expelled by vomiting, or the patient will swallow a piece of lint or a root of a thistle.
Or swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, then have them swallow it.  If it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the thread quickly.  Do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone adheres to it and is removed. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this form:
It should be slightly thicker than a lead rod.  At its tip, there is a bend, and the patient will gently insert it into their throat, with their head raised upwards, taking care not to touch their throat to avoid coughing and thereby dislodging the bone or thorn.  Or the physician can insert it with their hand.
The patient inserting it is better, as they know the location of the lodged object.  They push it downwards or pull their hand with the instrument upwards,  all according to what is possible for them until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Removing a leech lodged in the throat.
If treatment with the remedies described in the section on medication is unsuccessful, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight after pressing down their tongue with the instrument described for you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If this doesn't work, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then introduce a heated iron into the tube.
Repeat this several times.  The patient should abstain from drinking all day.  Then, the patient should take a vessel filled with cool water, open their mouth over it, rinse their mouth without swallowing a drop, and move the water around with their hand from time to time.
The leech will fall off if it feels the water. If it does not come out with the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and with halit (a substance) using the instrument described in the fumigation of the throat. Repeat this several times, and the leech will fall off.
The procedure for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire, the vessel covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Place the end of the instrument in this hole. Then, place the fumigant in the vessel and have the patient place their mouth at the end of the tube, closing their mouth to keep the smoke from escaping, until it is known that the smoke has reached the throat.
The leech will fall off if it is affected in this way. If it does not fall off, the fumigation is repeated several times. The patient should endure thirst and eat salty foods and garlic, but not drink water.  The leech must come out with this procedure. This is the image of the instrument for pulling the leech from the throat if it is observed.
It resembles tongs, as you see, except that it has this curve that enters the throat, and its tips resemble a bird's mouth.  They have the roughness of a file, so if they grasp something, they will not let go.
Another instrument is used to compress the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, sized to fit the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth, standing on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will. The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It will discuss the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many diverse types, as will be described individually in this book.  They differ in their lancing and incision in two ways: one is based on the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second type is determined by the location of the tumor within the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is different from a tumor in the buttocks, and a tumor in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint.  Each has its own surgical procedure.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus is fully ripe and mature. Others, however, should be lanced while still unripe, such as tumors close to the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition worsens until it causes decay around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing paralysis of the limb, or the tumor might be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should lance it while still unripe.  A tumor unripe and near the buttocks should be lanced, lest the suppuration spread and penetrate into the rectum, becoming a fistula.
It will become incurable. You must know when to lance tumors that are fully ripe: when the tumor's pain subsides, the fever is gone, the redness and throbbing diminish, the tumor's head softens, and other symptoms abate.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, for easier drainage downwards, or at the thinnest, most prominent part.  If the tumors are on the arms or legs, the incision should follow the length of the limb.
The incision should be made over muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, in short, over all straight, unyielding areas.  For areas that bend, the incision should follow the contour of the area. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it's best to avoid lancing.
Until its maturity is complete, as we have said. If you lance it before that, the pus will drain excessively, causing much harm and filth, and perhaps its edges and cavity will harden. Some tumors may need to be lanced across the body, when necessary, or according to what the limb requires.
Small tumors should be lanced once, while large tumors should be lanced widely or with many incisions, according to the tumor's size.  Some tumors may require skin excision or cutting, if they have become like a rag.
Some have, to a degree, died, like what happens frequently with boils and abscesses.  Some are incised in a three-angled manner, and some are cut away, like a rue leaf, similar to a groin tumor.
Some use a round incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar cuts.  For tumors that lack a head, such as flat, smooth tumors, a simple incision should suffice. If the tumor is large, has accumulated for a long time, and has been lanced, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, then apply pressure to the tumor for another day, then drain some more pus.  Repeat this gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, pregnant, a young child, or elderly, the animal spirit frequently weakens with the sudden discharge of pus.  The patient may die without your awareness, so be very cautious.
After lancing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the tumor wound is small or the incision simple, use a bandage of linen or worn cotton. If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous,
You should insert a bandage into each incision until some of them touch. If the tumor has penetrated or broken through the skin, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen strips, without moisture, and bandage it for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until healed. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the treatment and remedies described in many places in this book and in the sections. If it is winter and the tumor area is richly supplied with nerves, you should wet the bandages with warm drink and oil.
And place them on the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply the bandages soaked in water and oil, or in cool drink and oil, until, as we said, the third day, then you should dissolve the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until healed. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for detailed methods, each tumor type's treatment is described in a summarized and categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the treatment of tumors appearing on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of pustule, containing pockets like a chicken's egg sac.  There are many varieties, some fatty, some containing moisture like mud.
Some contain moisture like porridge and stew, and similar substances.  Some are hardened and solid.  All are safe to incise and remove, unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
And the procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument, the image of which will come after this, called the *midas*, so as to know what they contain.  If it contains moisture, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this fashion:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If the moisture has drained, dissect the sac that contained the moisture, and cut it all away, leaving nothing at all; for often it returns if any remains.
Then dip a piece of cotton in the astringent ointment, if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, as it will consume any remaining sac.  Then, repeat the application of cotton with astringent, two or three times, if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.  If the swelling contains fatty matter, incise it in this fashion:
Make a cross-shaped incision, and place the forceps on the edges of the wound.  Dissecting from every side, exert all your effort in removing the peritoneum that contains it.  If an artery obstructs you, do what I have described to you before.  And do the same for the swelling, if it is hardened, from the incision.
The treatment itself is as I have described.  The incision on a hardened swelling is easier, because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people have absolutely no moisture.  This is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling as hard as solid stone, rough, white, and no one could break it, even if one threw it, it would only chip.  And the other swellings that occur in the head, unlike this one, such as the swellings that appear on the heads of children...
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision in each, and position the flaps from below to facilitate the flow of matter downward. Then treat it with appropriate remedies.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning the incision on swine that often appear in the neck:  These swellings often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins.  They may appear on the rest of the body.  Sometimes a single one appears in the neck, sometimes multiple ones, and some develop from others.
Each such swelling has its own enclosed membrane, as with swellings and tumors of the head, as we described. There are many types of these swellings, some stony, some containing moisture, and some malignant, unresponsive to treatment.
Of those I have seen, some were favorably presented to the touch. Their appearance was near the color of skin, movable in all directions, not attached to the neck's nerve, veins, or arteries, and not deeply embedded. Therefore, a simple incision should be made from top to bottom of the body, in this manner, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Peel it from all sides and stretch the skin flaps with a hook or two, or many hooks if necessary, as we said for tumors of the head. Remove it little by little, taking care not to sever a vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be overly sharp.
So that your hand does not increase the cutting or cause the patient distress by cutting what is not necessary. If you sever a vein or artery and this hinders your work, place powdered astringent or some of the substances which stop bleeding into the wound.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides, the wound relaxes, and it begins to fester. The bleeding will then stop. Return to your work until finished. Then examine with your index finger if any smaller splinters remain, cutting and removing them.
If a large vein is present at the base of the splinter, it should not be cut from its root. Instead, it should be tied with a strong doubled thread, left to fall out of itself without harm, and then the wound should be filled with used cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treated.
If the entire splinter is removed, the edges of the wound should be brought together and stitched immediately, after making sure there is no remaining fragment. If you see that a fragment of the splinter's base remains, however.
You should aim to cut at the root and base of the splinters and use the sutures and methods we previously described. For splinters containing moisture, apply a simple poultice where you see signs of their ripening, placing the poultice below as we have mentioned.
Then, after the poultice, apply Egyptian ointment or similar to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with flesh-growing ointments until healed.
Chapter Forty-Three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor that arises inside the throat.
The ancients have described this throat incision, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it.  This agrees with their words.  However, those with a sore throat should avoid throat incision, as it will not benefit them.
In order that all tumors and the lungs may be diseased, and those who have a burning tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no problem with the windpipe, then it is necessary to use a throat incision to escape the damage that occurs from suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should make an incision in the throat under three rings of the windpipe or four small horizontal incisions between two rings, as much as an incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the throat skin with a hook, and then cut the skin until when he reaches the windpipe, he should avoid blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the peritoneum that we have described, and he should ascertain the incision of the windpipe from the phlegm that comes out of it along with what is being punctured and from the cessation of the voice.  Leave the wound open for a time, and when the time during which suffocation was feared has passed, bring the edges of the wound together from the skin.
And he should suture it alone, without the cartilage.  Then the medicines that promote the growth of flesh should be used until it heals.  The author of this book said, the explanation of this statement that we have related is that, if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors that have been mentioned.
When the patient is close to death, and he is distressed at the prospect of death, they went to cut the throat so that the patient could breathe through the wound and be saved from death.  But they were ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the illness is completed, and its duration is three days or similar.
At that point, they ordered the wound to be sewn up and treated until it healed.  What I saw with my own eyes was that a servant took a knife and inflicted a cut on her throat, cutting through some of the windpipe.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening, as a slaughtered animal weakens.  I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood that came from the wound to be slight, so I was certain that she had not cut a vein or an artery.  Air was escaping from the wound.  I quickly sutured and treated the wound until it healed.  The servant experienced nothing except a slight hoarseness in her voice, nothing more.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  Therefore, we say that cutting the throat does not involve any danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision of the swelling that appears on the larynx from the outside, and is called the swelling of the larynx.
This swelling, called the swelling of the larynx, is a large swelling the color of the body.  It is common in women and comes in two types.
Either it is natural or incidental. The natural one has no remedy. The incidental one is of two types: one resembling fatty tumors, and the other resembling a swelling arising from arterial entanglement.  Incising it is dangerous. Therefore, one should not use iron at all, unless it is small. If, upon probing and examining it with a probe, it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any vessels, then incise it as one would incise a tumor. And remove it with the sac it is in if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, then treat the area with appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On incising tumors of various types.
Tumors are numerous; all their types have been described in the classification.  Here, we must explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as it is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and terrible pain until the boiling of the pus subsides. And when the pus matures, the fever and intensity subside.  A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain; it is contained within a serous sac, a specific casing, and is the same color as the body.  It begins like a boil and becomes like a swelling, larger or smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture; and the colors of moisture are many, as stated in the classification.  Therefore, when you are about to treat a tumor, you must first probe and examine it with the instrument called a 'probe', as its image will be shown in the following chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what follows in its wake. If a flowing moisture of any color emerges, make a simple incision, as mentioned in other tumors. If no moisture follows the probe, know that it is fatty.
Incise it with a firm incision in this manner, as I have taught you, and suspend it by tongs. Gently separate the skin from all sides, and if possible, carefully remove the sac containing the tumor intact.
If the sac breaks during the procedure, and you are unable to remove it intact, which often happens, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains, for if any part of it remains, small or large, the tumor will recur in most cases.
If you are unsuccessful and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cauterizing substances after completion of the procedure, and tighten the wound. Apply something to soothe the inflamed tumor and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat it with a healing agent.
If a bleeding vein, whether pulsating or not, appears, immediately apply powdered alum to the affected area and keep it firmly pressed for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the blood stops flowing.  Then return to removing any remaining part of the tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the images of instruments.
Which are used in incisions and penetrations, including images of probes, which come in three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of tempered steel, square-ended, and tight to quickly penetrate tumors.  These are images of probes, called "bard," and also come in three types: large, medium, and small.  Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
It is suitable for probing tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to discover the bones and other contents within.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, from Chinese brass, or from aespadrine, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver.  The best is made from aespadrine.
Probes can also be made from lead, and are suitable for probing fistulas that have a crooked interior, since its flexibility allows it to follow the curve.  These are also three types, because there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones.
According to the need of each fistula's interior, its thickness is made in proportion to the fistula's spaciousness or narrowness.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  There are many types, for some are simple, meaning having a single hook, and these are three types: large, medium, and small.  There are also blind hooks, which are three types, and there are hooks with two hooks, which are three types, and there are also curved hooks with two hooks. These are three types.  There are also hooks with three hooks, which are three types.  Each of these types needs its own location.  Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large double-hooked instrument. Image of a medium double-hooked instrument. Image of a small double-hooked instrument.
Image of a large three-pronged instrument.
Image of a medium three-pronged instrument. Image of a small three-pronged instrument.
These are images of the scalpels used to cut and dissect tumors and masses.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its blades, with which it cuts, are limited, and the other ends are not limited.  This was done so that it could be used to dissect the mass when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient may be supported and find a little relief from the burning sensation felt when the tumor is dissected.
These are images of retractors.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished brass, like that used for kohl, and on one end it resembles a wide spoon of two layers, having a hidden scalpel blade at its head resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of probes used to incise tumors between the fingers so the patient does not feel them. There are three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Images of cupping vessels used to drain blood.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large cupping vessel.
They are made of copper or tin, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see, and thin.  You should have these cupping vessels, large and small, to quickly drain blood when necessary, and when medication is unavailable.
However, they are not to be used for drawing blood from every part of the body, but rather in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist, fleshy organs.
Other smaller instruments, resembling pistachio shells, may be made from them, in this form.
Blood may be drawn with them if it flows from a vein incision or when a vein or artery is cut, and they may be made rounded in this form.
The forty-seventh chapter.
On the treatment of the male breast.
The breast of some men, resembling that of women, may swell at puberty until it resembles a woman's breast, remaining swollen and unsightly.  One who dislikes this should make an incision on the breast in the shape of a crescent moon, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then, remove all fat.  Then, fill the wound with the medicated ointment.  Then, stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until healed.  If the breast sags and relaxes because of its bone structure, as happens with women,
Then, you should make incisions on its upper sides in the shape of two crescent moons, each touching the other at its ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, in this fashion. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat is removed, and the mentioned sutures, cauterization, and any necessary treatment are used until healed.
If the incision does not encompass the necessary amount of tissue, either because of the patient's distress or bleeding, then the wound should be filled with cotton dipped in caustic ointment and left until it consumes any remaining fat, then treated until healed.
Chapter Forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors appearing under the armpit.
These tumors appearing under the armpit are of the pig-like, solid, sac-containing variety; some contain moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If all the fluid in the tumor has been discharged, absorb the excess with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until healed.  If the tumor is of the pig-like knot type, incise it as we described for pig-like tumors.  If the wound becomes suppurative, apply cauterization as we mentioned previously.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Incising the tumor which appears near an artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often results.  Likewise, a vein can also cause swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which one knows if the swelling and puffiness are from an artery or a vein: if from an artery, the tumor is oblong, confined deep within the body, and when you press the tumor with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
And that from a vein, the tumor is round, on the surface of the body.  Incisions on these tumors are dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other parts of the body, and if they are quite large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those also in the extremities or head should be avoided.  For those that are swellings of the arterial mouth, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle beneath it and pierce it to the other side and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I explained to you in the ligation of the arteries in the neck, then pierce with a lancet the area between the ligaments until all the blood is expelled.
The swelling will subside, and then use the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, you should hold as much of the swelling with the skin as possible with your hand, then insert a needle below the area you held with your hand and pierce it, with a doubled thread in it, until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the swelling tightly with it, according to what I told you about tying the bandage on both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle.
Tie your threads in four places, then cut the swelling in the middle until what is inside comes out, then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied, then apply a compress soaked in a potion and oil to it. Then use the treatment that involves twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if a blow occurs or from excessive fatigue, or the like. This is more often the case in the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where joints move, it is a hard swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body.  It is often painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation like numbness.  The swelling is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, not forward or backward.  Any swelling in the joints should not be treated with iron, as it might cause a wound.  What is in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, hold it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound. Treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-one.
Concerning the removal of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called fungous because of their resemblance to fungi, often appear on the abdomens and other parts of the body of some people.  Their base is thin, their head thick, and sometimes their edges become inflamed.  They can be small or very large.
I once observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi in appearance.  Their thin, whitish bases were inflamed and cracked, with moisture constantly dripping from them. I removed them; the weight of one was approximately eighteen ounces and the other approximately six ounces.
When removing them, if the lesion is moist and the wart is whitish, moist, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel. Have cautery readily available, as considerable bleeding often occurs during excision.
If bleeding becomes excessive, cauterize it. If the patient is fearful of cutting with metal, take a strong lead thread and tightly bind the wart (with these characteristics). Leave it for two days, then increase the tension of the lead thread; continue tightening the lead.
As the lead tightens, the wart will eventually break off and fall away on its own, without further intervention.  If the wart has a thick base, there is some risk and uncertainty in removing it completely, particularly if it is on the abdomen.  However, it may be possible to remove half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals. Beware of removing a wart that is dark-colored, has little sensitivity, and a dull appearance; it could be a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-two.
In the treatment of umbilical tumors.
Umbilical tumors may arise from various causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, allowing bowel or other viscera to protrude, as in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from accumulated gas.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of viscera, the tumor will be the same color as the body, soft and painless, and of a varying shape. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestines, its position will be even more varied than described.  If you press it with your fingers, it will disappear and then reappear, and there might be rumbling. It often enlarges greatly when entering a bath or experiencing strenuous exertion.  If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease in size, then if it is due to blood, the tumor will show a bluish/dark color in addition to these symptoms.  If it is due to a growth of flesh, the tumor will be hard and immobile, and consistent in size.
If it is due to gas, the touch will be soft.  In this case, one should refrain from treatment, for there is danger and deception, as I have explained in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the protrusion of the navel is due to intestines or viscera, you should instruct the patient to hold still and stand upright, then carefully trace the outline around the entire navel with a stylus. Then, you should instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, use a wide scalpel to make a circular incision around the navel at the location marked with the stylus. Then, lift the center of the tumor upward with a large hook, and tightly tie the incision site with strong thread or fine silk.
The knot of the ligature should be a figure-of-eight.  Then, open the center of the drawn-up tumor above the ligature, insert your index finger, and probe for the intestines. If you find that the intestines are caught in the ligature, loosen the figure-of-eight knot and push the intestines back into the abdomen. If you find the viscera, lift them with the hook.
And cut off the excess. If an artery or vein intervenes, tie it off.  Return to your work.  Take two needles and thread strong thread through them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, anchoring them firmly. Then, tie the tumor in four places to the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the drawn-up flesh becomes gangrenous and falls off on its own, or cut it away once it thins and becomes gangrenous.  Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the protrusion of the navel is from overgrown flesh.
Or if it is from moisture, you should cauterize the tumor, as we have said, and remove the blood or moisture you find there. Then, treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously mentioned the types of cancer and how to treat them with medicines, warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate.  We have also described cancer originating in the uterus and warned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that when cancer is in a location where it can be completely excised, such as cancer in the breast or the thigh and similar easily removable organs, especially if it is small and in its early stages, it should be removed completely. However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who succeeded in doing so.  If it is located in a site that is accessible, as we have said, proceed to draw out the black fluid repeatedly, then dissect it if it is full of blood vessels.
Then apply a compress that enables the work to proceed, and insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer, then cut around it from all sides including the skin thoroughly, until nothing of its roots remains.  Allow the blood to flow, do not cut it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and draw out all the thick blood with your hand or any suitable instruments. If, during the procedure, excessive bleeding occurs due to an artery or vein being cut, constrict the affected area until the bleeding stops, and then continue treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of tumors.
We have already discussed the classification of hydrops, how water collects, the symptoms of each type, and its treatment with medication.  Only the *zaqi* (a specific type of hydrops) is treated with iron; the *tabi* (another type) and the fleshy type are absolutely not to be treated with iron.
If you have treated this type of *zaqi* tumor with medication, and your treatment is ineffective, then consider if the patient is significantly weakened or has another illness in addition to the tumor.
If there is a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailment, do not treat it with iron; it is dangerous.  If you observe that the patient is strong, has no other illness besides the tumor, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then proceed as follows: place the patient upright before you. And a servant behind him will grasp his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic area.  Then take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
Having two limited ends, long and sharply pointed like a scalpel, but with a slightly rounded edge to prevent injury to the intestines when using it, then see if the tumor originated from the intestines.
If the tumor originated from the liver, the incision should be three fingers below the navel, slightly above the pubic bone.  If it originated from the spleen, the incision should be three fingers to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, so that fluids do not run to that weak spot.  Then, pierce the skin all the way with the instrument and insert the instrument into the incision and lift your hand.
With the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, the amount peeled being roughly the size of a fingernail.  Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, the location of the fluid, then extract it and insert the instrument of this shape into the opening.
It resembles a thin tube made of silver, copper, or smooth polished leather.  At its bottom is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
A small, pointed tip, resembling a pen's nib, may be affixed to its end, as shown in this image.
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the fluid, it will immediately drain from the patient onto the instrument.  Drain a moderate amount of fluid, for if you remove more than necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of the vital spirit.
Or he may experience a near-death fainting spell.  However, drain only as much as his strength permits, guided by the patient's pulse strength and complexion, then remove the instrument and contain the fluid, as it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin that covers the opening in the peritoneum, which you were told to cover in that manner.  Then re-employ the instrument another day if you see the patient able to tolerate it.
You should also remove only a small amount of fluid, doing this for several days, keeping a close watch for mistakes, so that only a small amount of fluid remains.  If you fear for the patient and have left behind a large amount of fluid, treat it with burial in hot sand.
Heavy sweating in baths and in the sun, enduring thirst, and treatment with dried medications until recovery.  Cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the fluid as described previously.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In treating infants born with unperforated or constricted urinary openings, or with openings in the wrong location.
Some boys may be born with an unperforated foreskin; therefore, one should immediately perforate it as soon as they are born.
With a very thin scalpel, in this manner:.
Then, place a thin lead nail in the opening, tie it, and hold it for three or four days. When urination is desired, remove it and let him urinate; then, replace it. If you do not use the lead, the urine that passes through the opening may cause it to close.
And as for those with a constricted opening, it is treated with lead, as we mentioned, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place – some are born with the opening at the end of the foreskin, so that they cannot urinate forward.
Until he lifts the urethra upward with his hand.  Before this, semen cannot reach the uterus straight, which is a very serious problem.  The method of treatment is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then, stretch his foreskin firmly with your left hand and trim the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like carving something so that the middle protrudes, like a foreskin, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
Be careful of bleeding during your work, as it often occurs.  Address the bleeding with what stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the ulcers that appear in the foreskin, foreskin sheath, and the darkening and corruption and adhesion of the foreskin to the foreskin sheath.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra, a fleshy, dark protrusion, which may be malignant or non-malignant.  The non-malignant one should be removed with a gentle snare.
And cut it completely clean, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment.  Then treat it with palm ointment until it heals.  However, if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, cauterization should be applied after cutting and scraping it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then the ulcer inside should be removed first.  Once it has healed, then treat the external portion.
Because if you treat both simultaneously, you risk the foreskin tearing.  It can also occur in women, and in the foreskin, there may be darkening and corruption.  All blackened or potentially corrupting areas should be cauterized.
Then apply honey, crushed and sieved pomegranate rind, and crushed kermes to the area.  Then treat it with further remedies until it heals.  If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this way:
Cauterization is beneficial for both cases, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the cautery mark is completely gone, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate through.  As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the cautery mark...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision.  Adhesion may also result from a wound or tumor.  The foreskin should be scraped with a sharp scalpel until the ligament loosens, and the cautery mark is fully separated.
If it is difficult to distinguish them, then a small portion of the cautery mark and foreskin should be separated.  The foreskin is delicate and may tear easily due to its thinness. Then, separate the foreskin from the cautery mark with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cool water so as to prevent further adhesion.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the purification of boys and treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing more than the separation of connection, like other surgical procedures. However, since it is an action of our own volition, and specifically used on boys, the best possible procedure must be implemented.
And the easiest path to safety, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws, but rather something we have acquired.
By experience, I have found that the majority of surgeons and barbers use purification with a knife and scissors, and employ cauterization, tying with thread, and cutting with a nail.  I have tried all these methods.
Therefore, I found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with a knife often damages the skin, as the foreskin has two layers.  Perhaps the outer layer is cut, while the inner layer remains.
One is then forced to make another cut, causing renewed pain.  Cauterization does not prevent the cutting of the urethral tip, as it may enter the opening.  As for purification with a nail, the skin may tear, ruining your work, or the boy's skin may be too short by nature.
Many are born in such a way that they do not need purification, as I have seen.  As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors make even cuts, as the blade on top is like the blade on the bottom.
When you squeeze your hand, the blades cut at the same level and in the same time, and the thread becomes like a wall around the urethral skin from all sides, making mistakes impossible.  First, you must reassure the boy.
Especially if he understands a little that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it for another day, then make him happy and pleased in every way you can, and whatever he accepts in his mind, then position him upright before you.
Do not let him sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot.  Do not let the boy's eyes see them or anything else from the tools. Then, insert your hand into his urethra, and blow on the skin, pushing it upward until the tip of the urethra is exposed.
Then, cleanse it of any dirt that may have gathered.  Then tie the marked area with a doubled thread, then tie a second knot a little lower.  Then, firmly grasp the lower knot with your thumb and forefinger, and cut between the knots. Then quickly lift the skin upward and withdraw the tip of the urethra.  Allow the blood to flow for a little while, as this is better and lessens swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and then sprinkle dried, burned pumpkin ash onto it, as this is the best I've experienced, or fine sawdust, also a good option.
Then quickly lift the skin upward and withdraw the tip of the urethra.  Allow the blood to flow for a little while, as this is better and lessens swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, and then sprinkle dried, burned pumpkin ash onto it, as this is the best I've experienced, or fine sawdust, also a good option. Then apply a poultice made from a beaten, hard-boiled egg in rose water, mixed with soft, good rose oil, to the wound.  Leave it on for a day.  Then continue with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
This is a suitable scissor design for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-like. The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A common mistake in the procedure is that the inner skin, wholly or partially, may turn inward during the cutting.  Therefore, one should gently spread it with a fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it (the skin) evenly. If you can't grasp it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If after three days, the area beneath the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and gently peel it away.
Cut it as best you can, being careful around the head of the urethra. If a bit of the urethral head is cut, it will not be harmful. Treat the wound with the poultices described in the article on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upward, this also is not overly harmful. Treat it as described until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-eight.
On treating obstructed urine in the bladder.
Obstructed urine in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or grown flesh, and the like. If you treat it using the methods of treatment described in the classifications,
And if the urine does not flow, and you perceive that its retention is due to a stone that has harmed the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be placed on their knees, prostrate, and then a man should mount his back, extending his abdomen onto the back, and the patient should hold himself as best he can.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backward, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow as described, and the patient's condition worsens, then one should use the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about a foot and a half in length.  It has a gentle funnel at its head.  The method of drawing urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie a piece of cotton or wool to one end securely.
You insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter and trim any excess wool with pliers so that it fits snugly inside the tube, like a button.  Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
His bladder and urethra are softened with moist applications, or warm water and oil, then the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra, until it reaches the root of the urethra.  Then, the urethra is bent upward towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed into it.
Once the urethra is bent, the catheter is pushed further in until it approaches the perineum.  The penis is then tilted downwards, with the catheter inside, and pushed until it reaches the bladder, where the patient feels it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this way because the passage for urine has curves.  Then, the thread with the wool is pulled gently, causing the urine to follow the wool.  Then, it is removed, the urine is drained, and the catheter is reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory.  They have a long, thin tube, and are intended to drip water and medicines.  This is done with an instrument called a syringe.  Here is its image.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long, thin tube, hollowed out entirely except for the tip, which is solid with three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part, where the projectile is, should be just enough to hold it without more.  Thus, if you pull something out of the moisture, it will be pulled out; if you push something in, it will be pushed away, just as the oil-thrower used in naval warfare does.
If you wish to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull up on the plunger. The moisture will be drawn into the syringe. Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as described for catheters, and push the moisture out using the plunger.
This moisture will reach the bladder and the patient will feel it. This is also an image of a gentle enema instrument to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or a similar material; its upper part resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove where the cord is placed.  Then a camel's bladder is taken and the moisture to be injected into the bladder is placed inside.  Then it is securely tied between the grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm the moisture slightly over a fire. Then insert the tip of the enema instrument into the urethra.  Firmly press on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If a bladder is unavailable, take a piece of thin material, shape it into a circle, and pierce holes all around it.  Tie a strong thread securely through these holes, as you go around. Then, assemble the circle, as you would assemble a tray, after placing within it the desired moisture, ointments, or water.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously described the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with the signs of each.  We have also discussed stones requiring manual removal or incision.
This is particularly true of bladder stones, and those that form in the urethra, which I will describe clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones most often affect children.  A sign of this is that the urine is discharged from the bladder like thin water.
Sand is also visible, and they scratch and play with their penis.  It often hangs down, and the anus often protrudes in many cases.  Children often recover from this up to the age of fourteen; it is more difficult in the elderly, and in young adults it is intermediate.
The larger the stones, the easier the treatment; the smaller ones, the opposite.  When we come to treatment, first the patient should be given an enema to remove all the impurities in his intestines, as this may obstruct the examination of the stones.
Then the patient is taken by the legs and shaken downward to bring the stone down to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps repeatedly from a high place.  Then he is seated upright before you, hands under his thighs, so the bladder is tilted downwards, and then it is examined.
And you feel for it from the outside. If you feel a stone in the area, immediately make an incision into it. If it is not at all under your touch, then you should lubricate the index finger with grease from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If it is a fully grown boy, you introduce it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it is under your finger, you move it a little at a time to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you want to incise.
You instruct a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant to stretch the perineum upward with his right hand, and with his other hand to pull the skin below the perineum towards the location of the incision.  Then take the dissecting forceps, which are of this form:
Incise between the anus and the perineum, not in the middle, but to the side of the left groin. The incision should be over the stone itself. Your finger should be in the anus, pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, to the extent possible for the stone to exit.
Do not enlarge the incision too much; perhaps the finger in the anus will press the stone during the incision, causing it to exit without difficulty.  Be aware that some stones have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like a nut, and round, making removal easy; but those with angles and edges require a slightly larger incision.  If it still does not come out, you should devise a means to remove it, perhaps by grasping it with a firm forceps, the tip of which is like a rasp.
To grip the stone and not lose it; or to insert a delicate, curved instrument under it.  If you cannot do this, widen the incision slightly.  If much blood is present, cauterize it with a cautery.
If there is more than one stone, first push the largest one toward the bladder opening, then make an incision on it.  Then push the smaller ones out afterward.  Do the same if there are more than two.  If the stone is very large, it would be foolish to make a very large incision, as this exposes the patient to one of two outcomes.
Either he will die or he will have constant dribbling of urine, because the wound will never heal properly. But try to push it out; or devise a means to break it with forceps to remove it in pieces.
When you are finished, treat the wound with kender, sabr, shiyan, and stitches. Place a dressing soaked in oil and a drink, or rose ointment and cool water over it to calm the hot swelling. Then the patient should lie on his back, and the bandages should not be removed for three days.
When the swelling subsides, wash the area with much water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basil ointment until it heals. If an excessive inflammatory swelling, ulceration, or similar occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder that prevents urination, and this is recognized by the presence of blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to the corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of issue with a corresponding treatment until it heals.
During all treatment times, the thighs should be bound together to hold the medications applied to the area. If the stone is small and has become lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and obstructing urination, treat it as I have described above before it reaches a rupture.
Often, this treatment has dispensed with incision, a method I have tested.  Take a chisel of tempered steel, its form like this:
The chisel's tip is sharp and pointed, fixed to a stick. Then, take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then, gently insert the chisel's iron into the urethra until the chisel reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the chisel in the stone, bit by bit, aiming to pierce it until it passes through to the other side.  Immediately, urine will flow.  Then, grasp the remaining stone from outside the penis and squeeze.  It will break apart and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone. Then, make an incision on the stone in the urethra between the ties, and remove it.
Then, untie the thread and clean the coagulated blood that has accumulated in the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread was tied above to ensure that, when the thread is removed after the stone's expulsion, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely form in women. If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for several reasons. One, the woman may be a virgin; the second, it is difficult to find a woman who would allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or related, and third, you cannot find a woman skilled in this practice, especially in manual procedures. Fourth, the incision site for a stone in women is far from the stone itself, requiring a deep incision.
In this case, there is danger. If necessity demands it, one should seek a skilled female physician, though such are rare. If one is not found, seek a virtuous and compassionate male physician or bring in a skilled female midwife or someone with some knowledge in this field.
You should bring her in and instruct her to perform all necessary examinations to locate the stone. First, if the woman is a virgin, a finger should be inserted into her vagina to search for the stone. If found, it should be pressed against her finger.
Then instruct her to make an incision. If the woman is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina to search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and applying firm pressure.
If found, she should gently guide it away from the mouth of the bladder, down as far as possible, towards the upper thigh.  Then make an incision at the point where the vagina meets the upper thigh, whichever side feels the stone is located.
Her finger should remain on the stone, pressing it down.  The incision should be small at first. Then, using a probe, if she feels the stone, she should increase the incision size as much as necessary for the stone to exit.  Know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched stones.  Know their types so you can identify what you are dealing with. If bleeding occurs, sprinkle crushed alum over the wound and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone is removed. Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, to aid your work. If severe bleeding occurs, and you know the bleeding is from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
Press firmly with the forceps and leave it. Do not reapply. Leave the stone and do not remove it.  The patient may perish.  Then treat the wound. If the bleeding subsides after several days and the area becomes infected, return to your work, until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the incision on the watery dropsy.
Watery dropsy is the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum beneath the scrotum, which surrounds the testicle, and is called the scrotum. It may also be in a special membrane which nature has prepared in one area of the testicle.
So that one might think it another testicle, and it is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum we mentioned.  This occurs only rarely.  This dropsy arises from weakness that affects females, in which this substance accumulates.  It may also arise from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture comes in various colors: sometimes yellow, sometimes bloody red, sometimes dark blackish-purple, sometimes watery white, which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where there is an accumulation of water, if it is in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat oval, like an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a separate membrane, the swelling is rounded on one side of the testicle.
For this reason, one might imagine it another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable.  If you wish to determine the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe we previously described.  Judge by what is inside the probe's impression.
If we turn to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to be bled, if possible, and if you see their body is full.  Then, they should lie on their back on a slightly raised surface, placing many cloths beneath.  You then sit to their left.
And instruct a servant to sit on his right, extending the patient's penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the lower abdominal region. Then, take a broad lancet and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotum's skin, from the middle towards the pubic area.
The incision should be made in a straight line parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until it reaches the white peritoneum.  Carefully separate it, avoiding further incision.  Your separation should be more pronounced on the side that adheres to the testicle.  Continue the separation as much as possible.
Then, widely dissect the water-filled peritoneum, removing all the water.  Separate the edges of the incision with forceps, and pull the peritoneum upwards, avoiding contact with the scrotum's skin.  Cut the peritoneum as much as possible, either entirely or in pieces.
Especially the thin side, for if you do not fully sever it, you will not be sure the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes from its skin during the procedure, then return it to its place once you have finished cutting the peritoneum, and stitch the edges of the scrotum skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals.  If the testicle has already been damaged by another illness, you should tie off the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding, then cut the testicle from the sac, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously described.
If the collected water is present in both sides, then know that it is a hydrocele in both. Incise the other side as you did the first, or if it seems easier to perform the procedure on only one side, then do so.  Then, wipe away the blood.
Place wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  On the outside, place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil, spread it over the testicles and abdominal cavity.  Place a folded cloth, the 'rafad', on top. Bind it from above with the six-sided bandage, in this manner:
Then take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, like this example.  Make the straps for binding from damp cotton or wool and fasten them with a belt around the waist.  One strap should be placed on the buttocks towards the back.
The second strap should go towards the pubic area, with the other two straps on the lower thighs and the remaining two straps on the groins.  All the straps are tied to the waist belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with a knife.
This involves taking a thin, heated cautery iron, to cut the scrotum skin, until the white sac containing the water is exposed.  Take another cautery iron like this:
It resembles a Greek eye. Then, using it, cauterize the sac while it is hot, until all the moisture is expelled. Then, stretch the sac with forceps and cauterize the containing layer and cut it as much as possible, until all are removed. Be careful not to burn the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and less prone to bleeding than the incision method. If during the incision or cauterization a hot swelling or bleeding or something else occurs, it is necessary to treat each issue with the appropriate treatment as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, let him use the cauterization method as I describe, if it is correct according to the previous indications.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair. Then cauterize the swelling beneath it with a wide spatula. Make the cauterization along the body, with a wide opening so all the water drains. Then, place cotton on the area and bind it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during the cauterization, it is likely because the white membrane is obstructing the wound opening, preventing the water from draining.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used for extracting the water from the afflicted, which has been previously illustrated, or enlarge the wound opening slightly.
Know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient must endure the days.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the fissure of fleshy ulcers and their treatment.
Know that a fissure on these ulcers is a perilous matter, leading to death in most cases.  Therefore, we recommend leaving them alone and avoiding them. I will describe the treatment and the different types of ulcers.
I say that many tumors can occur in bodies whose structure is like that of the vagina. This can arise from various causes, either from a sharp excess flowing towards the vagina, or from a blow. The color of the tumor is the same as the color of the body, and there is no fluid in it.
The tumor is hard, and sometimes it may be stony, the color like mud, and has no sensation. It may also arise from a constriction and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins. If it is from an arterial swelling, this is recognized by the scattering of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it will not yield; one should not attempt this at all.  As for what arises from the swelling of the veins, nothing will dissipate from it when pressed with fingers. This type may cause fissures in itself and in other flesh.
One should make a cut in the testicle's skin, then pull the testicle upward, bringing it out from the white peritoneum.  Remove the ligament from its vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the ligament after having freed it from every side of the testicle.  If the testicle has become attached to those growing flesh.
Then the testicle should be removed and cut. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between vessels, then all such adhesions must be separated and cut in a circular fashion.
If the flesh has grown in the place of adhesion, which is behind, then all of it must be cut and the testicle removed, as we have said. When your work is complete, treat the wound with moist wool in rose-scented oil and drink, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-four.
On treating the dropsy accompanying dropsy.
Dropsy is a swelling twisted in some way, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the limbs.  It hinders the afflicted person from movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment for this ailment is similar to what was previously mentioned.
However, it is necessary to mention the treatment as the ancients did.  I say that the afflicted person should sit on a raised chair, then pull the limbs downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it and stretch it vigorously.  Then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make an oblique cut alongside the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.  Then, dissect from every side, as I described to you in dissecting the arteries of the temples.  Then, insert a needle with a double thread into it.
Tie it at the initial points where the dropsy appeared and also at its end. Then, cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body, and remove the collected impure and corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that require time to heal.  Removing the vessels nourishing one of the limbs is acceptable, for a time. If the dropsy affects all the vessels, then one limb, with the vessels, must be removed, so that the testicle does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wilt and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal dropsy.
This dropsy occurs when a fissure appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, near the groin, and the intestines protrude into one of the limbs through that hernia.
This hernia is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types arise from many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a cry, or lifting a heavy object, and so on.  The sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long period.
It does not occur suddenly.  The swelling is flat to the depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestines.  If it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, the sign is that it is accompanied by severe pain immediately at the start, and the swelling is noticeably different beneath the skin nearby.
This is due to the intestines emerging and passing outside the peritoneum.  Pus may also emerge with the intestines, in which case this dropsy is called intestinal and purulent.  It may also be accompanied by wind, and the bowels may be obstructed with faeces, which can lead to the patient's demise.
Because it causes intense pain and rumbling, especially if compressed.  The treatment for these types of ailments with iron is risky; therefore, one must be cautious about resorting to it.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to push the intestines back into their cavity with their hand if they are able to return.
Then he lies on his back before you, and his legs are raised. Then the skin next to the groin is pulled upward, and the entire scrotal skin is cut lengthwise.  Then hooks are inserted into the edges of the incision, as much as needed to widen the slit.
The incision should be as large as possible to allow the testicle to be extracted. Then, the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin is peeled back until the white, firm peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  At that point, insert your index finger beneath the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, the adhesions behind the testicle are released.  Then, the right hand pushes inward against the scrotal skin, while the left hand pulls the white peritoneum upward and lifts the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
You instruct the servant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely release the adhesions behind it.  Examine with your finger to ensure there is no twisted intestine within the firm white peritoneum. If you find any, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the incision.  Then cut the ends of the thread, so that four strands remain. Then, tie the strands together in a firm knot, and bind the peritoneum, which we said was under the scrotal skin, firmly from both sides.  Then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the nourishing vessels can reach it. To prevent a hot swelling from developing.  Also make a second knot outside the first knot, at least two fingerbreadths away.  After these two knots, leave a space of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin the size of a finger.
To prevent a hot swelling from developing.  Also make a second knot outside the first knot, at least two fingerbreadths away.  After these two knots, leave a space of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin the size of a finger. Cut the rest completely in a circle and remove the testicle.  Then cut a slit below the scrotal skin, from which blood and pus will flow as described previously. Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and use the ligature as described.
The white peritoneum, which we said to cut carefully to prevent blood flow, often presents this problem.  Leave the ligature until it falls off naturally.  If it takes too long to fall off, apply warm water and something that will cause perspiration to hasten its removal.
Then treat the wound with all other surgical treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this type of flatulence, I have seen no one dare treat it with iron.  The ancients mentioned creating [the treatment] as described for the flatulence with the pouch, namely by tying the vessels gently beneath the incision.
Then it is incised in the middle and the swelling is treated to open it up so that the vessels fall out, and the wound is treated as we described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
In the hernia of the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, and nothing of the intestines descends into the groin.  If it does descend, this is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the rupture in the peritoneum increases until the intestines and the spermatic cord descend into the scrotum, and that appears from the extension of the peritoneum that is in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and prolapses the area, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I previously described.
It may also be treated with an iron, in this manner: the patient lies on their back before you, then you make a transverse incision at the location of the swollen protruding hernia, about the width of three fingers, and then you dissect the peritoneum under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed, then you take a reed, place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum, pressing it into the abdomen's depth. Then you stitch the two protruding parts of the peritoneum at the reed's end, and attach one to the other with stitches.
Then you withdraw the reed, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle, nor anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernias. Then treat it with the treatment of surgical procedures.
When the threads are severed, clean and close the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum will contract, and the hernia will not increase.
And this method is superior in this location, as it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
Relaxation of the scrotum skin.
The scrotum skin often relaxes in some people without the internal flesh relaxing, making the appearance unattractive.  Therefore, whoever wishes to treat it should lay the patient on their back.
Cut all the relaxed skin away from the thick skin, then bring the edges together.  If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure the stitches are secure, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the usual treatment for other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, it was necessary for me not to mention it in this book of mine.  However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be part of the physician's knowledge when questioned about it, and so that he may know the treatment for those who have been afflicted; and the other, that we often need to castrate animals for our benefit.
Like sheep, oxen, and cats, and other animals like that, I say that castration can be done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting.  The method involving crushing is that we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush it with your hand until it breaks apart and is no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and grasp the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the appendages and make a single cut on each testicle.
Until the testicles protrude, then cut them off after removing their coverings, leaving no peritoneum on them except the thin membrane that covers the vessels. This type of castration is better than that done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave some part of the testicles, and the animal might desire mating, and then the wound must be treated until it heals.
Seventy-first chapter.
On the treatment of hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in males is of two types. One is that which appears below the scrotum or in the scrotal skin between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotal skin.
As for females, there is one type, which is located above the vulva on the pubis, like small, protruding male testicles, one of which resembles a male penis, and the two are like the female ones.  The treatment for all three types.
The two types of males and the single type of females, the excess flesh must be cut off until its trace is gone, then treated with the treatment of other surgical wounds until healed. As for the second type of males from whom urine flows from within the scrotal skin, there is no treatment and it does not improve at all.
Chapter Seventy-one.
On cutting the clitoris and excess flesh from the vulva of women.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural state, becoming inflamed and unattractive, and in some women, may even enlarge, spreading out like that of a man, and interfering with intercourse.
Therefore, you should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or forceps and cut it off.  Do not cut too deeply, especially not into the root, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And perhaps it will protrude outwards, resembling a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients called it the "tail-like disease."  You should cut it off, like the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of hernia.
Hernia is when a woman's vagina is not pierced or the piercing is small, and it may be either congenital or acquired.  An acquired hernia results from a previous ailment and may be due to excess, growing flesh.
or thin or thick peritoneum, and it may be located deep within the uterus, along its sides, at the top or bottom, preventing intercourse, procreation, and childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  A midwife can determine this by observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close by, and if not visible, she should investigate with her fingers or a probe.  If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and is close to the labia, then promptly pierce it, that is, place a sort of wedge on the labia, and then place your thumbs from both hands.
And the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, forcefully spread the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction is opened. Then, take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should be copulated daily so that the area does not close again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a wide scalpel resembling a leaf of asparagus. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, grasp it with forceps and cut it. Have with you remedies to stop bleeding without cauterization, such as acacia, cynamomum, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube to prevent the wound from closing quickly. Hold it for days, then use a dry linen wick.  Treat it with the usual treatment for inflammation until it heals.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus, which should also be cut in this manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are swellings of the veins' mouths, causing copious and constant bleeding.  If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs were previously mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
Of those that are treatable and those that are not, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if located deep within the uterus and not perceptible to touch, are not treatable with iron. Those that are in the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are those that are treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then the warts should be scraped with a lancet or a rough cloth and cut from their roots.  Then, after bleeding from one of the blood-stopping incisions, powder should be applied, without pricking.
Such as qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense, and similar substances.  Then, raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and astringents, and similar substances. Then, take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this to her back. If the bleeding stops, then stop. Otherwise, apply leeches to the groin and breasts, without restrictions. Then, take wool, dip it in the juice of celandine or the juice of comfrey or the juice of elder twigs with astringent drink, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the affected area with ointment until healed.  As for a red sore, resembling the heads of boils, rough in appearance, it should be cut away as described for warts, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the treatment of a tumor that appears in the uterus.
Many types of tumors can appear in the uterus, such as cancer, stony tumor, ulcers, wasting disease, devouring disease, warts, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors.  All these diseases and their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification.
Therefore, in this article, we should discuss the hot tumor appearing in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that accumulate over time, how it should be treated with iron.  It is necessary to observe whether the pain of the tumor at its onset is severe, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
If you see that it is red, and if it is sensitive to touch, do not rush to treat it with cauterization. Treat it with something that aids maturation, until these symptoms subside. Then, the woman should sit on a stool with two seats, leaning back.
And her legs should be brought together towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs spread apart. Her arms should be placed under her knees, and tied together with an appropriate bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument for opening the cervix, the image of which will be shown later.  When using this instrument, one should estimate the depth of the woman's uterus to ensure the instrument does not penetrate beyond its depth.
If the instrument is too deep, it will harm the patient.  If the instrument extends beyond the depth, then pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine cavity.  The spiral that runs through the instrument should be positioned from the top.
While you hold the instrument, the servant should rotate the spiral until the cervix opens. If a boil is visible and feels soft and thin, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel.  If all the pus has been discharged.
A soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should extend outward from the incision in the cervix and, externally, on the uterus and pubis, clean wool should be soaked in boiled baker's water.
Then, treat it after two days with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with the root of the wormwood or long zeraond.  Then return to the ointment. If the boil is hidden deep within the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but to treat it with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter Seventy-five.
On teaching midwives how to treat live fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife must first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include the woman's pushing downwards, her longing to smell the air, and the easing of her postpartum discomfort.
And if the fetus emerges quickly, know that this birth is in the natural form, and the fetus emerges headfirst, with the placenta attached or hanging from its navel.  If you see these signs, you should massage her abdomen to facilitate the fetus's quick expulsion.
If it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it, and is cleaned thoroughly of impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and objectionable, for the fetus may emerge on its feet, with its hands and feet before its head.
One hand or one foot, or the head and a hand, or it emerges curled, or perhaps on its back, and other such objectionable forms. The midwife must be skillful and gentle with all these things, and avoid errors and mistakes.
And I am explaining each form and how to handle it so that you will be able to recognize it and understand it.  If the fetus emerges headfirst, the natural way, and if the woman is greatly burdened and finds the delivery difficult, and you see her strength weakening, then have her sit on a chair and instruct women to assist her.
Bind her uterus with cooked herbs and moist ointments.  Then, the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers and cut the placenta, or cut it with her nail, until the moisture within it flows out.  Massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with the juice of fenugreek and a sheirj unguent.  Then, after the injection, tell her to cough and to sneeze her with a kunds.  Hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge soon.  If the fetus' hands emerge first, then gently push them back, little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a stool, and raise her legs above.  Then shake the stool on the ground, and the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shaking.  If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them out gently; it will come out.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, then you should push its feet upwards, then gradually turn the fetus to straighten it out, then take one of its feet and pull it out gradually.
If they emerge to the thighs, tell her to cough and sneeze her with a kunds, then it will come out. If it does not come out as described, then gently push the fetus back bit by bit until it is in its natural position, then it will come out smoothly. If it resists all these methods.
Take the juice of  *khatmi*, the juice of fenugreek, sheirj unguent, and dissolved gum. Grind them well in a mortar. Then apply it to the vulva and lower abdomen of the woman. Then seat her in lukewarm water until the fetlock joints are reached.
If you see that it has softened beneath, make her a poultice of myrrh and let her bear it. If she holds the poultice for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then sneeze her, block her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen, then the fetus will come out immediately. The fetus will emerge on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands bit by bit. Then have the woman lie on her back, her legs dangling downward, lying on a bed, and her hands clasped together. Then gently squeeze the upper abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her feet are raised.  If the fetus does not come out, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then squeeze above the fetlocks bit by bit until the fetus rises. Then the midwife should insert her hand and gently reshape the fetus.
Tell the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus will emerge sideways, one arm dangling.  Gently try to return the arm.  If you cannot, then make the woman stand, and have her walk. If she cannot walk, then have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice described from the saliva. If the delivery begins, seat her on a chair, then work to return the arm and straighten the fetus to its normal shape. Make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it comes out.
If the fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, and face towards the mother's back, the midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn it and straighten it.  Once straightened, apply the grease and saliva as previously described.
Then tell her to move slightly, and when she does, seat her on a chair.  Tell her to lean to the right side, then instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with the stick.  The fetus will come out, upright on its side.
If the fetus and placenta descend in this manner, slit the placenta with your fingernail to remove moisture. If the placenta adheres to the fetus's face or neck, cut it from the navel to prevent suffocation and death. Then push the fetus inside to correct its position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly, as this will facilitate delivery.  Twins, or multiple fetuses, are often born.  Three or four may be born and survive, but this is rare. Five fetuses are unnatural and will not survive.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous, and are separated by a membranous partition attached to the navel of each.  They may emerge as a single, naturally, easily delivered fetus.  They may also emerge in a difficult way, as described before.
If some of them are difficult to deliver and present unnatural forms, treat them as described previously.  Let the midwife be gentle and act with care, and ingenuity for each case, employing any methods that lead to safety.
Fetuses that can be conceived in the womb include one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten.  I have observed a woman who miscarried seven and another who miscarried fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the all-knowing and all-powerful, all this should be part of a midwife's knowledge, as such occurrences may happen to her one day, and she should be prepared to handle them appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-seven.
On the removal of a stillborn fetus.
If, after treating the stillborn fetus with the methods of treatment described in the section on treatments, it is not expelled and you are forced to use your hands, then you must observe. If the woman is strong and healthy, and shows no symptoms that suggest potential harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not shift when the fetus is pulled out.
Then, the mouth of her uterus should be moistened with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatmi* plant, fenugreek, and flaxseed.  Then the midwife should anoint her hands with these ointments and saliva.  Then, she should gently insert her hands into the uterus, and then seek a location in which to insert the hooks from the fetus, and the appropriate places for this.
If the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, insert the hooks into its eyes, or the back of its neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
And if the descent is on its feet, then in the pubic area and the middle ribs.  One should hold the hook with the right hand, and curl it between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and the hook into one of the positions mentioned.
Until it reaches an empty space, then insert another or a third hook, if needed, so that the pull is equal and does not lean to one side, then pull in a level manner.  The pull should not be straight, but should be moved in all directions.
To make its expulsion easier, just as one does with a tooth when extracting it.  In between, the pull should be relaxed.  If it is stuck in a particular area, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment, and insert them to rotate whatever is stuck. If some part of the fetus emerges, move the hooks to other positions.
She should do this gradually, until the whole fetus is expelled. If a hand comes out before the rest and cannot be pushed back due to compression, it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled out until it is completely expelled, then cut it off.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Likewise, this should be done for the other hand and legs. If the fetal head is large and faces pressure during expulsion, or if there is accumulated water in its head, then a pointed/sharp scalpel should be inserted between the fingers.
With it, one should split the head, so the water comes out, or crush it with the instrument called the *mashdakh*, which appears in the image of other tools in the following chapter.
Likewise, do this if the fetus has a naturally large head.  The skull should be split or crushed with the *mashdakh*, as we said, and then the bones removed with forceps. If the head comes out and is compressed at the collarbone, it should be split to drain the moisture in the chest.
Then the chest will adhere.  If the chest does not adhere and cannot be expelled, cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains a tumor, it should be incised so that moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and positioning it toward the cervix is easy.  If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be cut to drain the contents.
If the rest of the organs are removed and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand.  If the cervix is open, insert the hand into the neck of the uterus, feel for the head, and pull it with the fingers toward the cervix. Then insert a hook or two and pull with them.
If the cervix has adhered to a hot, inflamed tumor, it should not be forced.  Instead, moist, oily substances should be applied, compresses used, and she should sit in relaxing and moistening waters.
If the fetus is on its side, if possible, the procedures described for a living fetus should be used.  If not possible, it should be cut and removed.  Absolutely nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  Once you have finished the treatment, use the treatments described for hot tumors that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into constricting waters and use all other treatments.  I have witnessed a woman who conceived, then the fetus died within her, and then she conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her abdomen, swelling until it opened and began to discharge pus.  I was called to treat her and treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  I then applied some strong, drawing ointments.
Then a bone came out of the area.  After several days, another bone came out.  I was amazed by this, as the abdomen is a location without bone.  I surmised that it was from the bones of the dead fetus.  I probed the wound and removed numerous bones from the head of the fetus.
I continued this process until I removed many bones.  The woman was in the best of health.  She lived for some time, with only a slight discharge of pus from the area.  I have related this unusual case.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to achieve by his own hand in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This is the binder with which books are bound. It has two spirals at the ends of the wooden planks.  However, this spiral should be gentler than the binder, and should be made either of ebony or of lignum vitae wood. The width of each plank should be the thickness of two fingers.
Their edges should be about a finger's width, and their length should be a foot and a half.  In the middle of the planks, two dowels of the same wood are secured within them, with a length of half a foot or slightly more, and a width of about two fingers or slightly more. These two dowels...
They are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  An image of another similar instrument, gentler and lighter.
Made from ebony or lignum vitae wood, shaped like tongs, but with two dowels at the end, as you see.  The length of each dowel is about a foot, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Then, place the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart, and insert these two dowels, tightly, into the cervix.  While holding the end of the instrument below her between her thighs, open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with tongs, to the degree of opening the cervix you desire. Until the midwife accomplishes what she wants.  An image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end, as you see.  It can be made into a rectangle like tongs, with teeth like a saw to cut and sever.
Image of another instrument.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so as not to break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more varied their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his esteem among people.  Do not disdain any instrument being prepared for you; there is inevitably a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, the woman should be instructed to hold herself, then to be made to sneeze with a cundurango, and hold your hand tightly over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, then do so; otherwise, take a measure.
Pierce a hole in the cover, place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fodenj, sithab, dill, chamomile, shih, sliakha, and qanthorion, all or some of these medicines.  Soak them in water and heat them over a fire, then place a silver tube on the hole in the cover, and the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze, as we said.  If the placenta comes out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in the grease of a she-goat or the saliva of the Egyptian viper.
Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, grasp it and pull it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described, until the placenta is found, then pull it out slowly, gently.
So that the uterus does not fall when pulled too hard, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left.  Then increase the amount of pulling, as it will respond and become free from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, the treatment with sneezing, the pot, and the herbs, has been described.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid force when pulling it back.  Instead, tie what has been removed to the woman's thigh, then inject her with the four-fold ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, but if it rots, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, it is necessary to use appropriate incense.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the incense of myrrh and dried figs, a description of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated when menses and placenta are retained, and the like.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper.  The thin end is placed at the vulva, and the wide end on the fire.  Incense is placed on the embers, held until it is consumed, and then replaced with more.
The seventy-ninth chapter.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, sometimes blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should pierce it with a sharp lancet, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat with ointments until healed.  If you fear that it will close again, place a lead tube in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
A blockage of the anus may also result from a wound abscess or a tumor.  It is necessary to incise this abscess, and then treat with the remedies mentioned, and cauterize.
Eighty-eighth chapter.
Treatment of warts that occur on the lower parts.
Warts that occur on the lower parts are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus, externally or in the space on one side, and may be one or more in number.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a watery, whitish fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate the rectum and intestines.  Those that do not penetrate can be identified by what is discharged in the stool and wind when using laxatives for bowel movements.
And worms may come from them.  Some warts, if in the space, may penetrate the bladder and urethra.  Some may penetrate the thigh joint and coccyx.  What is known about the wart penetrating the anus also applies to those that do not penetrate.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe of copper or iron into the wart, if there is no winding in the wart. If there is a winding, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.  If you feel nothing at all and no stool, wind, or worms emerge from the opening, as we have said, know that it is not penetrated; then proceed to treatment.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it and the inability of the area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates the thigh joint or coccyx, the sign is the probe reaching that place.
If there is no winding to the bone, and there is pain in the vicinity, and pus constantly discharges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment, these penetrating warts are all incurable.
Treating them is a fruitless effort for those unskilled physicians who attempt it.  As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for using iron, as I describe and have experienced.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise the patient's legs upward, and incline the thighs towards the abdomen.  Then introduce a brass or lead probe into the wart, if there is a winding, so that you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated itself, exposed without feeling any tissue or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not expend effort on it, as there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Some say it heals in rare cases in some people.  A treatment that may be helpful is to heat a thin cautery according to the size of the wart, as mentioned before, and insert it into the wart until it reaches the vicinity of the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
So that you know that all of the excess, solidified flesh, resembling the tube of a bird's feather, has been burned. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter until that burned flesh is removed. Then treat it with healing ointments, and if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe, but it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between the probe and your finger, and you see the wart beneath the skin surface, then in that case, cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. As you make the incision with the probe inside the wart, continue the incision until you reach where the tip of the probe ends.  Remove the probe and discard it. Then, clean away all the solidified flesh resembling a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then, treat it with healing ointments until it heals.  If bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from completing the excision of that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.  Cauterization with fire combines two beneficial effects: burning the excess flesh.
Stop the bleeding and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the area becomes purulent and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then, at that point, treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the remedies that have a binding and drying effect.  If it is consolidated, then it has healed, and further attempts are not necessary. If the wart extends deep into the anus and away from the body surface, insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetration, then the only approach is through hope and anticipation.  That is, you should use one of three approaches: either cauterize it, as we have stated.
Or to dissect it until you reach its bottom to gain access to insert the thread and treatment from close proximity. Do not exaggerate the dissection, lest you sever the muscle surrounding the anus, causing involuntary bowel movements in the patient. Then, treat it with the methods mentioned, and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or, after dissecting it to the vicinity of the anus as we mentioned, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument, penetrate that barrier and pierce it.  Then, thoroughly remove all the congested flesh that is in the incision to the extent possible.
Then, suture the entire wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed, leaving the wart open within the anus, which will be less troublesome for the patient.  The wart may be cured in this manner.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart, it is located on one side of the anus, near the skin surface and the ring of the anus, then take a probe with a pierced tip, like a shoemaker's awl, in this manner:
Then, insert a twisted thread of five strands or so into it.  Then, insert the probe with the thread into the wart until it reaches the bottom; if it is punctured in the edge of the anus from the inside, near the edge.
Then, take the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling the thread out.  Gather both ends and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two.  Every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it firmly until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls off.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not punctured, puncture it as best you can, but if it is deep, you must not do so, lest you cut the muscle.  Then do with it as we have described until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed lancet used to cut warts should have a very sharp curve on one side and a blunt side on the other, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red swellings or bunches of grapes, small or large, and blood constantly drips from them.
They can be single or multiple, and some are located outside the anus, along its edges.  However, those located outside the anus are usually less moist, dripping yellowish water or a little blood constantly.  They are the same color as the skin.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to have the patient defecate and strain until the anus protrudes, and the growths are visible.  Then quickly grasp them with forceps or your fingernail and cut them at their roots. If forceps cannot grasp them due to their moisture and looseness,
Then grab them with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened linen, or pull them out with your fingers. Cut them and then, after cutting, sprinkle sharp powders to act as cauterization, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  If the anus does not come out, inject the patient with an enema containing a small amount of irritant to wash out what's inside the anus and encourage quick expulsion when the patient strains.  As for the growths outside the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
To treat them, grasp them with your fingernail or forceps and cut them, then treat as previously described until healed.  For those who dislike cutting with iron, it is advisable to use a different method.  Take a thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upward, pierce it with the needle at its root from the other side, wrap the ends of the thread under the needle which is positioned across it, pull the wart firmly, tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the warts, leaving one unpierced.
To allow blood to drain, place a cloth dipped in rose oil or qirūṭī oil on the anus, instruct the patient to rest, and leave it until the warts fall off. Once they fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until healed.
As for treating fissures, they often arise from dryness, accumulation of waste material, and sluggishness. If they persist and remedies fail, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or fingernail until they become moist and the top layer of skin preventing healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, scrape it more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels. Then treat it; it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On treating inverted and non-inverted nails, dry warts, and the nits.
A nail is a round, skin-colored swelling resembling the head of a nail that occurs throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
One should cut around the nail, grasp it with a pick or a hook, and pull it out from its root, then treat it.  If desired, cauterize it as described in the relevant chapter.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hard, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They often appear on children's hands.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting it, or piercing it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.  If desired, cauterize it as previously described with fire or a caustic agent.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument I have mentioned in the treatment of nits.  Nits are also a small, hard, thickened protuberance on the skin's surface, penetrating deeply.  If exposed to cold, they produce a sensation similar to the sting of ants.
They occur throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a tube made of strong goose or eagle feathers, placing it around the nit, ensuring the tube encircles it completely, then turning the tube with your hand until it cracks the surrounding tissue.
Push it into the flesh and the nit will be pulled out from its root.  Alternatively, you can use a brass or iron tube in the same manner.
The top of the tube should be smooth and pliable, making it easy for the fingers to control and twist it.  Alternatively, cauterize the nit as previously described for cauterizing warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Illustrations of instruments used for injections in ailments of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, porcelain, or hollowed or hammered brass.  Small and large versions of this instrument can be made, depending on the intended users. The ones used to treat small children, or those with narrow or painful rectums, should be very delicate.  Image of a large syringe:.
The upper funnel, where the bag is attached, should be wide, with a partition where the bag is attached, as you see.  The lower end, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and solid.  On one side, two small holes; on the other side, a single hole.
The size of the holes should be the thickness of a reed or slightly thicker.  The bag for holding the medicine, made of animal bladder or sheepskin, should be shaped like a small tray, one span in diameter.
It is pierced with many holes, spiralling around, with a space of approximately finger's width between each hole. Then a strong thread, made of doubled ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes to gather the bag like a tray. When the medicine is placed inside, tighten the head of the syringe firmly between the stones. Then inject.  This is the image of the bag and its holes.
How to inject: fill the bladder or skin with medicine, warmed to the patient's tolerance. Be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. Then, the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed beneath. Then the tip of the syringe is smeared with ointment, egg white, or licorice saliva, or similar.  It is gently inserted into the rectum. The attendant of the bag holds it with both hands and squeezes forcefully until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowels.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs. If the medicine is pushing to come out, the patient should hold back as much as possible.  If the patient sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective for relieving. If injected for diarrhea and quick expulsion is desired, repeat the injection until cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe must be very gentle, smoother than the syringes used for children. This is an image of a gentle syringe, with its skin tightened.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have previously mentioned a classification of treatments similar to cauterization, and now I am describing here the treatment of cauterizations by hand and medicine thoroughly.  I say that wounds differ according to the object that caused the wound and according to the location of the wound.
The objects causing wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a stab from a spear or a stick or arrow, and many other things.
As for wounds according to locations on the body, like wounds on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple wounds of the head, particularly because the compound wounds will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, and if it is from a blow of a stone or similar, and the skin alone was bruised, and the wound was large, and I feared for the patient the onset of a hot swelling, then immediately lance it with the lancet on the spot. Do not delay this, and draw blood from him to the extent of his strength, unless something prevents venesection, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is slight, and let the venesection be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods. If anything prevents venesection, then let him lessen his food intake, avoid meat, and abstain from drinks. Apply a compress soaked in rose oil, alone or mixed with a drink with astringent properties, to the wound if a hot swelling occurs.
If you are not concerned about a hot swelling, apply a compress to the wound if it is fresh and its blood has not been altered by the pernicious air that I will describe to you shortly, but if the air has altered it, apply some ointments.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and from a sword cut or similar, and its edges have not come together by themselves, bring them together by stitching, as described in my account of abdominal wound suturing.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its only hold is in a slight attachment, cut it off, then treat the wound with remedies to form firm flesh in place of the skin.  Tell the patient to eat foods that provide strength, such as heads and marrow, and similar items.
If a foulness occurs in the skin but it is not attached to the bone, cut away all the rotten parts and apply a poultice.  Then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding, and the bleeding does not stop with remedies, then search for the artery.
If you strike it and it does not stop bleeding, cut it off with a scalpel and tie it off.  If the situation requires it, and what we have mentioned is not helpful, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple.  Just apply this powder to the wound while it is still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, the recipe for the powder is to take one part frankincense, two parts myrrh, and three parts quicklime or un-quicklime.  Grind all of them, sift it, and pack the wound with it, and tie it tightly so that it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then it is tied from above with bandages.  Leave it without undoing it as long as it does not swell.  The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  Quicklime itself can do this if frankincense and myrrh are not available.
This action can also be done with a poultice in many large wounds if its application and binding are well done, and the wounds are fresh and bleeding, as long as the air has not changed them.  However, if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is during the summer.
Applying this powder is not the only way to treat it.  Use some ripening ointments or a barley flour poultice made with water and honey until pus forms, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
If the wound involves a simple fracture of the bone, pull it out with a dressing.  The treatment of skull fractures is mentioned elsewhere, in the section on neck injuries. If the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treatments that constrict strongly, such as al-zunjar and al-zaj and similar substances, because they injure and spasm the nerve.
Absolutely nothing cold should be placed on the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use mild remedies like moistened rosewater and zinc oxide, or oil-soaked or rose and mulberry-oil based ointments.
If also washed with fresh water and other mineral substances in this manner, and moist ointments.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with strips, then treat until healed.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has accumulated at the bottom, drain it at the lowest point. If an artery is severed and blood is flowing, tie it off, cauterize it, or cut it if necessary.
If part or all of the cartilage of the larynx has been severed but the veins are intact, bring the edges of the skin together with sutures along the larynx, do not touch the larynx itself, but smooth it out and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for a period of time.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until healed. If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are bone fragments, remove all you can, or as many as possible. If not all can be removed, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powders we have described. If the bone in the wound has become necrotic and suppurated, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you see a cavity, observe if air escapes when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a deadly wound. If there is no cavity and it is fresh with blood, do not immediately apply powders or tighten it, lest the blood be trapped in the cavity.
It will recede to the heart and kill the patient. Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice daily. If ointment is unavailable, place a moistened compress in the wound to absorb the moisture.  Have the patient sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain any accumulated matter. If three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted, and the patient shows no spasms, abnormal palpitations, or shortness of breath, and their general condition is otherwise good, know that the wound is sound. Treat it with bandages and other remedies until healed.
If viewing the wound and applying gentle pressure does not reveal the cause of the persistent discharge, know that suppuration has occurred. Treat it according to the appropriate section.  The patient should lie on the wound to drain any accumulated matter. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it as described previously by suturing.
If large, apply powders; if small, apply powders.  If the wound has affected the bone, fracturing it, probe the wound and remove any loose fragments if they are readily available. If not, leave them until...
This will cause the wound to fester, making removal easier. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the principles we have outlined.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, intestinal protrusion, and their suturing.
A wound exposing the abdomen may be large, small, or medium.  A large wound may expose intestines, or several intestines.  Then, returning them to the abdomen and suturing them will be more difficult and harder.
A small wound too, may present difficulty in another way, requiring more challenging return of the intestines.  If the intestines are not returned to their proper place immediately, they swell and thicken, making their return more difficult.  Therefore, the most favorable wound is the medium one, because it does not cause the same difficulty in returning the intestines as the other two types.
Know that abdominal suturing has four types. The two general types are suitable for abdominal suturing and for suturing other bodily wounds; the other two types are specific; they apply to all wounds, but are especially suited to abdominal suturing.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification.  I say that if the wound is small and something of the intestines has protruded and its return is difficult, it is due to one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestines were previously inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone or in which has been cooked barley, saffron and hyssop, and apply it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with astringent properties may also achieve this, and is superior to plain water in resolving the swelling.  If you see that the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which you have cooked  fennel or anise, as this facilitates their return with ease.
If its return remains impossible after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for piercing the nostrils. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision, and incision is only resorted to as a last resort when all other methods fail.  This is a depiction of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is unlimited.  The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel blade, but is slightly blunt.  It is a tool similar to a small pickaxe, as you see.  If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, it is necessary that their return be to their natural form.
Its specific location, if achievable, is best.  However, if the wound is extensive and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated above their head.  If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised higher than the lower body.
Likewise, if the wound is in one side of the abdomen, always keep the side with the incision higher than the other.  This should be used in major and medium surgical procedures.
For minor surgeries, position it as best you can. Then have a helpful assistant hold the entire wound in their hands and bring the edges together.  Then, reveal the wound section by section to the person performing the stitching.
This is the common method of single-stitching: take a needle or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Leave a space the thickness of a little finger on the wound's edges.  Insert a single needle, without thread, into the edges of the skin. Using the skin's edges and the peritoneum's edges (beneath the skin, from within), until you penetrate it on that side.  The edges of the skin and peritoneum have come together, making four layers. Then, you tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides, bringing the wound edges together tightly.
Then leave a space the thickness of a finger and insert another needle.  Tie it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.  Continue doing this with as many needles as needed to completely close the wound.  Use needles of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore the needles should be of medium thickness.  Do not insert the needle into the skin's edge too deeply.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before it heals, and also do not pull too tightly with the sutures so that the wound cannot heal.  Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while they sleep.  Provide him with linen strips to hold the needle ends on each side.
Leave them until you know that the wound has healed.  This method of stitching with needles is best suited for minor surgeries, as it may suffice to use one or two needles, or so.
As for the method of suturing a common wound, gather the four edges, meaning the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, in one step using a needle with a thread of moderate thickness and thinness.  Then, after the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle from the same side from which you began.
So that the thread interlocks from above the wound, thus making the suture similar to the method of tying bags to secure goods.  Leave a space of the width of a little finger between each stitch.  This method of stitching is known to everyone.
With this method of suturing, a surgeon treated a man who had a wound in his abdomen caused by a knife.  The surgical opening was more than a span in size, and about two spans of the mid-intestine had protruded from the wound.  The opening was located in the center of the abdomen.
After the intestine had been protruding from the wound for twenty-four hours, he returned it.  The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he recovered.  He lived many years after that, functioning normally in all his activities.  The physicians had previously judged that he would not recover.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with any ointment, because I was in a place with no medications available.  I used old cotton on the wound twice a day and treated it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specific types of stitching, I mention it based on Galen's text:  Begin the stitching at the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.  Once the needle has penetrated the skin and the muscle, continue in a straight line along the entire length of the abdomen.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then, insert the needle into its other edge, from inside to outside, at the edge of the diaphragm.  If you have inserted it, insert it again into this same edge of the diaphragm, from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into its other edge, from inside to outside.  While inserting it into the peritoneum, insert it also into the edge of the diaphragm on its side, until it penetrates completely.
Then, beginning again from this same side, follow the edge adjacent to the peritoneum on the other side.  Bring the needle out through the skin near it, then return it to that same skin and follow the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, tracing the edge of the diaphragm alongside it.
Bring it out through the skin on its side.  Do this again and again, until you have stitched the entire wound in this manner.  The general description of this stitching is like the stitching of furriers for furs.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side, until it is empty.  As for the second type of specialized stitching mentioned by Galen, this is his statement in its entirety.
He means to stitch it in the manner some physicians stitch, by bringing together each part to its naturally corresponding counterpart, thus bringing the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the diaphragm to its other edge. This is how I describe it to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the diaphragm closest to you, from the outside, and penetrate it from the outside to the inside; leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then the needle should be returned and penetrated from the outside to the inside of both edges of the peritoneum, and then returned.
And penetrate it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the diaphragm on the opposite side.  This method of stitching is better than the simple, common stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's statement, verbatim. Some say that stitching the abdomen can be accomplished with two needles. This means to insert a single thread into both, starting by inserting the needle from your side and penetrating it to the other side; then insert the other needle from the opposite side and penetrate it to your side, according to the stitching of the leather workers, as is customary.
Know that if the rupture is in the center of the abdomen, stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is like other wounds.  If you grasp the wound fresh with its blood before the air has altered it, and you have returned and stitched the intestines securely, then apply a styptic dressing.
If the wound has been affected by the air, apply some ointments that you have available until it suppurates and the stitches fall out, and the peritoneum and diaphragm adhere; then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines available, apply a poultice of old cotton as soon as it begins to suppurate, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals. You will not require any further treatment in most cases, if the wounds are simple, unless you fear that the wound will cause major organs to be involved in the pain.
Therefore, it is necessary to dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit.  If he feels pain or putridity in his intestines, as often occurs, then inject him with a lukewarm, dark, astringent drink.
Especially if the putridity has reached the intestines and has become a penetrating wound into its cavity.  Know that the thicker portions of the intestines are easier to heal than the thinner ones.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it will not heal from a wound that occurs within it at all, due to the abundance and size of its blood vessels, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nerves.  However, if what protrudes from the wound is the jejunum and you catch it quickly, return it in the same manner as you would return a severed portion of intestine.
If it has been a while and the jejunum has turned green or black, then it should be tied with thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, because the jejunum contains veins and arteries.  Then cut what is below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so it is easier for you to lift and remove it when the jejunum falls out and the wound becomes suppurative.  This describes a wound that occurs in the intestines.  Now, if a perforation in the intestines occurs, and it is small...
In some cases, it may be possible to repair it, for I have seen a person who had been wounded in the abdomen by a spear thrust.  The wound was to the right of the stomach, and it festered, and feces and air were discharged from it.  I treated it, though I did not hope for a cure. I continued to treat him until he healed, and the area closed.  When I saw the area had healed, I feared that the patient might have some unfortunate occurrence within his body.  But he had no such misfortune, and remained in the best possible condition. Indeed, he ate, drank, engaged in sexual intercourse, bathed, and performed exercises as part of his care.  Some experienced individuals have stated that if a small wound occurs in the intestines, it should be sutured in this manner.
Large ants, with large heads, are taken.  Then the edges of the wound are brought together.  An ant, with its mouth open, is placed over the edges of the wound. If it bites down and closes its mouth, its head is cut off; it then adheres and does not come loose. Then another ant is placed near the first one.
This is repeated with several ants according to the size of the wound, and then the wound is closed and sutured.  Those heads remain attached to the intestines until the intestines heal and recover, and no harm occurs to the patient.  The intestines can also be sutured with thin thread.
The method for removing the animal glue from the needle is to take the end of this thread from the glue and pull it free.  Then a fine, spun linen thread is tied to that end, and this linen thread is then placed in the needle. The glue thread is used to suture the intestines, and then the intestines are returned to the abdomen.  This method of suturing with ants and glue is only by way of hope and expectation.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy and no cure.
Chapter Eighty-six.
In the treatment of colds and nasal obstructions.
Know that any wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic, protracted, and ulcerated without healing, and constantly discharges pus that does not cease, is generally called a fistula, in whatever organ it may be, and we call it a cold or fistula.
It is, in fact, a hardened, dense, white mass without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some called it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, constantly discharging pus; sometimes the moisture may cease.  This moisture may be profuse or scant, thick or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical injuries that any ulcer that does not heal or form flesh does so for one of nine reasons; one of which is either a deficiency of blood in the body, or poor quality of the blood, or a hard mass of flesh within or on the edges that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or, it is due to its being excessively harmful and dirty, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter it discharges is of poor quality, or that the treatment is inappropriate, or to a widespread disease in the region, or to a specific condition of the region.
Or, it is due to its being excessively harmful and dirty, or that the ulcer itself is foul, and the matter it discharges is of poor quality, or that the treatment is inappropriate, or to a widespread disease in the region, or to a specific condition of the region. As is seen in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors slow by nature, or because of a single or multiple bones present.  I have explained all these causes, their signs, and treatments with medicines in the classification.
Here I must inform you about the treatment of boils and colds that occur through manual work.  Know that boils can occur in all parts of the body, some of which terminate in large veins, arteries, or nerves.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the multiple-part joints like the hand and foot, and some lead near to a major organ, and the like.
Those boils that are of this nature are among the difficult-to-cure diseases that do not accept treatment, and working on them is troublesome and ignorant.  If there are boils that do not reach the mentioned locations, and I hope and expect to cure them...
If you wish to understand this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the boil runs straight, probe it with that. If the boil has a bend, probe it with a thin lead probe, because lead softens the body.
It will slide when entering and bend towards the curve.  If the boil has many openings that you cannot identify with a probe, puncture one opening. Then the moisture you inject will follow to the other openings and drain out.
Then, diligently investigate in any way possible to ascertain if there is bone or nerve, if the bottom of the boil is distant or near, or if it is a single boil with multiple openings.  Determine all of this to the best of your ability by inquiring and noting the pain when your hand touches the area.
And similar to that are the signs and causes of the swelling.  If you have ascertained all of this truthfully, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  If...
If the boil is outwardly close or in a healthy area far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the locations I mentioned, then incise the boil as previously described and remove the hardened matter, corrupted flesh, and excess flesh from within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its opening, until it heals. If the boil is deep and in a straight line, it should be incised as deeply as possible, then cleansed of all its corrupted flesh.
Then use a finely-spun thread, saturated with strong medicines, and insert it into the bottom of the boil, which you locate with the iron probe. Do this repeatedly until the strong medicine consumes any remaining corruption at the bottom of the boil.
Then dress it with ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals.  If it does not heal with this, cauterize it according to the method previously described. If the cause of the boil is bone, and you are certain of this, probe and incise it as I instructed you, unless something prevents you.
If it is a vein, nerve, or major organ, as we said, and if the bone is exposed to you and has some corruption and darkness, then remove the corruption until it is gone, and then treat it with what will knit it together until it heals.  If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Therefore, expose everything on it again, and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort, then dress it. If it heals, then well and good.  If not, know that the corruption is in a very deep cavity.  Expose everything on it again.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with the finest forceps suitable for this.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove all of them, leaving nothing behind.  If any ligaments obstruct them, and cutting them poses no danger, cut those ligaments and any surrounding flesh, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at that time, apply something to the wound that will putrefy it, and leave it for some days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones are putrid.  Keep the wound open; do not allow the opening you created during your work to heal.
If you fear that, place on it a cotton swab dipped in pulverized sulfur mixed with oil, or a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments.  If those ligaments putrefy and the bones become loose, removing and pulling them out will be easy.
If it is a single large bone, such as the tibia or femur, and only its surface is corrupted, thoroughly scrape it until the blackness and corruption disappear, then close the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to spread the wound.
Cut it all the way to where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a case of a man's leg that has a cold, to use as an example and help you in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years ago, a man experienced pain in his leg, caused by a movement within his body, until the materials reached the leg and formed a large swelling. This was not due to an external cause.  Then, time passed, along with the errors of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
A great deal of material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated until his leg became affected by a cold, and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and bodily humors. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled surgeons.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, with materials flowing from those openings in a great flood. The man's body had wasted away, and his complexion had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, which led to the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to each other from all sides of the leg.  I then cut open one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone, which I found corrupted, eaten away, blackened, and rotten, with holes that reached the marrow. I described what I discovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, which I believe was the only corruption in the bone that I had cut and described, and I believe that I had removed it completely. Then I used bonding medicines on the wound for a long period, but it did not heal.  Then I uncovered the bone again, further than the first time.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, and I described what I saw of that corruption as well.  Then I tried to close it, but it did not heal or join.  Then I opened it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempted to close it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
I removed it along with its marrow, and then closed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and opening was necessary because of the patient's weakness, their limited tolerance, and my fear for their life, since they were experiencing frequent fainting spells due to excessive vomiting.  He recovered completely.
Solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in his body improved. His strength returned, and he acted normally.  No ailment affecting his walking ever troubled him.  If a bone in any part of the body had broken.
One should open it in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone.  Have someone pull it upward, and make another bandage of thicker wool than the first.
Then, tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, and pull its end to draw the flesh downward.  While exposing the flesh at the area to be opened, so the saw does not injure the flesh, place a board or plank under the bone from below, firmly.
For if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.  The incision should be slightly above the corrupted area, so that there is no corruption within the bone's cavity, which would not be apparent to the senses, forcing you to reopen it again.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, and its parts are joined together, with the corruption within its center or a part of it, expose the flesh on all sides. Then place the board underneath, and open it from the side where the corruption is.
Once you've completed the incision, open it from the other side, and let the incision be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and open the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the corruption is in the hand or foot, the treatment is very difficult. However, you should remove the corruption in whatever way it appears and excise and clean it in any way you can.
By whatever method is possible for you, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.  Know that the cuts and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position, setting, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suited to each type of work.
Know that the work itself will indicate the type of tool you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for whoever is skilled in the craft and has seen many diseases. He may devise tools for each disease, and I am depicting several tools at the end of this chapter for you.
Make them examples to follow and measurements by which to judge others, if God wills.  Image of a saw:.

Chapter eighty-seven.
In the amputation of limbs and the spreading of bones.
The limbs may decay either from an external cause or an internal one.  If you treat this decay with medicine and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the decay progressing in the limb, unchecked by anything.
Then you should amputate that limb where the decay has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a great calamity that is greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this affliction is that the limb turns black, so that you think fire has burned it.
Or it may decay after turning black, until the decay spreads to the part of the body next to that limb, and affects the whole body.  Therefore, act quickly to amputate it.  Also, if the cause of decay is a bite from some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, or similar things.
If the decay or bite is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger, and do not delay until the decay spreads to the hand.  Similarly, if the decay has reached the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not delay until the decay spreads to the elbow joint of the arm.
Also, if it has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow joint, at the joint itself.  If the decay progresses and you see it approaching the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder, as that will bring the patient's death.  Use other treatments to the extent possible.
Likewise, do this with the leg. If decay has reached the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints. If decay has reached the instep, amputate the entire leg.  If it has ascended to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and submit the patient to death.  The method for amputating or spreading the limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you wish to cut, and tie another bandage above the place.
One servant stretches the lower bandage downward, and another servant stretches the upper bandage upward.  You yourself scrape the flesh between the bandages with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed.  Then it is cut or spread.  You should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient excess pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the spot quickly, or apply some hemostatic styptics, then return to your treatment until finished.
Then bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a similar case, affecting a man's leg:  the same affliction I describe to you, which occurred on his leg with blackening and a burning sensation like fire.
This decay first appeared on his finger, eventually affecting his entire foot.  When the man saw the decay spreading through the limb, with the intense pain and burning he experienced, he had it amputated at the joint, and he recovered.
After a long time, the same decay appeared on his index finger. He came to me, and I applied the remedies I had prepared for the hand after cleaning his body.  But the decay did not stop, and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to his entire hand. He asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to restrain the decay, and fearing for his life from the amputation, because his strength was failing.  When he lost hope in me, he returned to his home.
I was later told that he eventually amputated his entire hand and recovered. I have related this story to assist in treating similar illnesses and as a guide for treatment.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject remedies into them.
If a fleshy tumor occurs in an organ and persists for a while, eventually bursting or rupturing, releasing all the matter within it, and leaving the area empty like a vessel.
The skin on it, like a tattered cloth, becomes thin, and the damage has not progressed to the extent that it has affected bone, nerve, or ligament.  For this reason, it is called an abscess, and not a fistula, unless the duration is prolonged, so that the damage affects one of these structures.
In that case, it is called a fistula or a sinus.  Its treatment is to cut away all of that skin, as it goes around, especially if it is thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it is not adhering to the area because of the damage.
If you expect the skin to adhere, and the damage has not reached that extent, and there is thick flesh in the skin, treat it with injections.  Observe the abscess. If it is large and the pus it produces has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and alum, equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey, then take what you need and dilute it with water and honey, inject it into the abscess, constrict its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then extract it by pressing.  Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor disappears.  If this medicine is unavailable, you may inject with ash water, which is prepared by taking the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed clean. If the patient is not responsive to the Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject him with water and honey in which some powdered alum has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed, because honey is apt to cleanse and wash, and syrup adheres to the abscess, especially if the syrup is somewhat astringent and dry.  If you do this several times and are certain that the abscess's corruption is gone, inject it with something that promotes flesh growth there.
Such as taking some of the palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and a binding syrup, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have demonstrated in the treatise on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and does not accommodate the injecting tube.
Then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or Syrian ointment inside it until it widens.  Likewise, if the opening is wide, sew its edges together, leaving only enough space for the injector to enter without excess.
Also, if the opening from which pus is flowing is elevated, incise it at the lowest point so that the pus drains downwards, because if pus is retained in the depths of the abscess, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot incise the abscess downwards as desired, then attempt to position the limb so that the pus flows out easily, as best you can, and ensure that no pus remains trapped within it.
As for the adhesive medicines that are applied to the abscess from the outside and how to apply them, take one of the adhesive ointments suitable to your needs, spread it on a linen cloth, ensuring the cloth covers the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut an opening slightly larger than the abscess's opening, spread some soft ointment onto another piece of cloth, sized to fit the opening, and place it in such a way that it is spaced away from the opening of the abscess so pus can drain easily. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the one on the abscess opening is removed periodically to allow the collected pus to drain, so you may observe whether the discharged pus is copious or scant, mature or immature.
Furthermore, examine the abscess site itself; does the patient feel pain, or not; is there swelling, or not?  If you continue your treatment in this manner and observe that the discharge from the abscess opening is minimal,
Know then that the abscess has adhered or is close to adhering.  In that case, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  Once you have treated the wound, replace the cloths with new ones and renew the ointment.  If, after a long period, thin pus is discharged from the abscess, do not despair of its adherence.
For its healing is near, because some people have slow wound healing, while others have rapid healing.  If, after many days, unripe pus drains from the abscess, know that it has not adhered.  If the abscess's adhesion is delayed,
Then increase the drying medicines, and let the medicines be moist in consistency but dry in strength, like the palm ointment, if more opobalsam has been added.  The most effective treatment is to use palm ointment.
It can also be treated by applying rose oil and sprinkling moderate, viscous, old wine over it, then mixing it with it and applying it.  A similar procedure can be used if palm ointment is unavailable:  use honey boiled until thickened, or take myrrh, licorice, and kender, powder them, and sprinkle them over the honey while it is on the fire. Then, apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the thickened boiled honey, sprinkle the medicines on it, place the cloth over it, and bind it.
Long-leaved wormwood, iris root, kresne flour, and dittany, either individually or mixed, can also be used.  Grind and sift them, sprinkle them on the honey I described, and apply them.  If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its core.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it as a nasal tumor as previously described.
Chapter Eighty-Nine.
In treating the bruised fingernail and the severed or superfluous finger, and the cleft joining of fingers.
The daḥs is excessive flesh that grows beneath the fingernail of the hand or foot, and possibly other fingers. If it persists and treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it rots and decays, consuming the base of the nail, possibly destroying it entirely, and possibly the decay reaching the bone, resulting in a foul odor, and the fingertip becoming broad and discolored, dark-grey.  If you treat it with the methods described in the previous sections, and your treatment is unsuccessful...
Then you must cut away all the superfluous growth from the nail with an instrument, and then cauterize the wound.  Cauterization is very effective in this case.  And if the bone is healthy and the nail also healthy...
If the corner of the nail had pressed the flesh inward, causing it to be pricked and irritated, then a thin strip of material should be placed under the corner of the nail that is pricking the flesh, and raise it upwards, and gently cut away that flesh.
Apply to the remaining flesh the burning, corrosive medicines until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals.  However, if the decay has affected the bone, you must cut away and remove the bone, for it will never heal as long as there is rotten bone within it.
If you see decay and erosion spreading through the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously described, and then treat it until it heals.  If the nail is struck or wounded, causing severe pain, you must first bleed the affected area.
Then, split the nail with a sharp scalpel, making an oblique cut from top to bottom.  Be careful not to extend the cut to the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause severe pain to the affected area and will cause an overgrowth of flesh in that place.  Then treat the affected area with something to relieve the pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bone in parts of it, or perhaps a nail.  Some parts may grow at the base of the joints of certain fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger phalanges.  Those that grow on the phalanges of the finger do not move, and those that grow at the finger joint may move.  Any purely fleshy part should be easily severed; you should cut it off at its base with a wide scalpel.
However, if it grows at the base of the joint, its removal is difficult. Avoid cutting it.  If it grows on the finger at one of the phalanges, you should first cut off the flesh in a circular fashion around the bone, then scrape the bone using one of the appropriate rasps for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this often happens at birth, or from the healing of a wound, burn, or similar injury.  You should split that adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural state. Then place a piece of gauze or a perforated piece of cloth soaked in rose oil between them so that they do not quickly reunite, and separate them or place a thin lead plate between them until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, split the adhesion as the shape of the limb allows.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting veins.
Veins are tortuous, thick vessels filled with dark, black blood, occurring in most parts of the body, but most frequently in the legs, particularly in the legs of travellers, laborers, and carriers.  Therefore, one should first use vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the black fluid.
Then, bleed the affected person with a lancet.  Treatment with an iron instrument has two types: one is to cut and remove the black blood; the other is to cut the vein and remove the entire vein.  As for cutting, the leg should first be soaked in warm water, indeed.
Until the thick, cloudy blood dissolves.  Then, the leg of the patient is tied with a bandage from above the thigh to below the knee.  Then, the vein is cut in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, the black blood is extracted by hand from the bottom of the leg upward and from the top downward, until a sufficient quantity of blood, or as much as the patient's strength can tolerate, is removed.  Then, the patient is bandaged and instructed to avoid foods that generate black blood, and emesis and bleeding are repeated.
When the veins become full and this harms the patient, as for vein cutting, it is done in this manner: the patient's leg is shaved if it has much hair, then the patient enters a bath and the leg is soaked in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or the patient engages in strenuous exercise.
If a bath is unavailable, to heat the limb, the skin is then cut alongside the vein lengthwise, either near the knee or lower down at the heel.  Then, the skin is opened with hooks and the vein is dissected from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it is red and glistening.  Once freed from the skin, it also resembles a tendon.  Then, a blunt probe is inserted beneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin, at which point it is secured with a smooth, blunt hook.  Then, another incision is made near the first, roughly the width of three fingers.
Then, dissect the skin away from the vein until it is exposed. Then, lift it with the probe, as was done before, and secure it with another hook, as was done initially.  Then, make another incision, or several incisions, if needed.
Then, cut and sever it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull and dissect it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it towards the incision above, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, above all the incisions.  Once it is all out, cut it.
If pulling and dissecting do not work, insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, tie it and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in all directions until it comes out.  Be careful not to break it, as if it breaks, it will be very difficult to dissect it further.
This can cause harm to the patient.  Once you have dissected it entirely, apply wool soaked in a potion and rose ointment or oil to the wound and treat it until healed.  If the varicose vein is tense and has twists and turns in different directions.
If it is not straight, as we said, then you should make an incision on each twist and bend, then secure it with hooks until you have dissected it entirely.  Be careful when making incisions to avoid cutting or injuring the vein, as it will make it difficult to dissect and preserve your efforts.
Image of the incision used for dissecting the varicose vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp, so as not to injure the vein.  Its bend should be thick and smooth, for if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness.  Instead, it should have a degree of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
In the treatment of the civilian vein.
This vein arises in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely fertile countries.  It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, resulting from a suppuration that occurs beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the abscesses of gourd and the worms that develop between the skin and flesh.  A sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that in the leg there will be intense inflammation, then the area will swell, and then the vein will begin to emerge from the location of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal.  If its tip appears, then a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams should be wrapped around it, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it outwards, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows large, cut off a portion and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its origin before it is all expelled, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, suppuration, and a foul ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it is necessary to gently draw it out gradually until it is completely expelled, leaving no part of it in the body.  In some people, this vein can grow to a length of five or ten cubits.
I have heard that it has reached twenty cubits in length in one man. If it breaks off during treatment, insert a reed into the hole and push it deeply into the body to empty it of its material, and try to heal the area with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint or the leg itself, forming many openings, and a branch emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the abscess of the worm generated under the hoof, known as the affliction of the cattle.
This disease is called in some of our countries the affliction of cattle, because it often affects cattle. It is a single small worm that develops between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the body, moving up and down.
It is felt as it crawls from one part of the body to another, until it penetrates the skin at a point, coming out and forming an abscess from the putrefaction of some fluids, as occurs with worms, snakes, and the gourd-like tumor in the abdomen.
Its danger lies in the possibility that, if it crawls through the body and reaches the head and the eye, it may burst through it and emerge, thereby destroying the eye. This often occurs.  Therefore, if one wishes to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it is crawling and visible to touch.
One should tie firmly above and below it with a strong bandage, then cut open and remove it.  If it has burrowed into the flesh and cannot be found, apply a cauterization with fire to the spot until it is burned out.  The greatest danger is its potential to damage the eye, as we mentioned.
If you see it near the eye in the head, tie firmly below it on the forehead, then cut open and remove it.  The patient should maintain the purification of his body with medicines that loosen putrid and bad fluids, and be cautious of foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-three.
Concerning the incision on the disease known as the "naفر".
This disease, called the nafr in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs, then moves from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a woman in distress in some remote area. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in the vein of the arm. After an hour, I saw that swelling creeping up the forearm, like a worm ascending towards her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain disappears from that spot and settles in the shoulder. Then, after an hour, it ran throughout the rest of the body until it was in the other arm, and she recounted to me that it was circling her entire body as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its transfer from one organ to another.  Before, I had only heard of this disease affecting organs in this way, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I had seen it in this woman.
I attributed this only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, lean of body, with exposed veins.  Therefore, this moving sensation was apparent to the touch.  It would not appear in a similar way in those of affluence, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain, if it appears to you visibly as we have described, then firmly press above and below it with urgency, and cut open the area until that congested sensation comes out.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and dispersing the air, such as with rotten bean or skabing bean and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations in the body where they are lodged.  As for their variation by type, there are large and small arrows, hollow and solid glass arrows, and those with three or four corners.
Some have tongues, others have splinters.  As for those located according to the organs they strike, they are of two kinds: either the organs are major, hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and signs of death that I will describe to you later appear, you should avoid extracting the arrow, for death will most often befall the person. If these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded in the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone, and wounding the membrane covering the brain include severe headache, swooning, and dizziness.
If these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded in the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone, and wounding the membrane covering the brain include severe headache, swooning, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and tongue, convulsion, confusion of mind, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears; perhaps speech and voice fail, and a white, porridge-like moisture, resembling the watery part of meat, may flow from the wound.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow, if it has not already been extracted.  As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, and if it is near the left breast, and felt as if it had lodged in something solid, not hollow.
Perhaps the arrow's movement resembles the pulse, and dark blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; know then that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels around the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, and he breathes heavily, seeking to inhale cold air.  If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs, and the breathing will be heavy, accompanied by severe pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move.  If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness flows from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may flow from the wound.
His condition is evident. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, pierces it, and something from the bowels, or the intestines, or the intestines themselves, have been punctured flow from the wound, then there is no hope for treatment or for removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine flows from the wound.
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are usually unharmed.
Unless the arrow hits an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow is poisoned, I am informing you of some things I have observed concerning these arrows so you may use them as a guide in your treatment. An arrow struck a man's eye socket at the base of his nose.
I removed it from the other side, beneath the ear cartilage, and he recovered without any harm to his eye.  I also removed another arrow for a Jew, which had lodged in the cartilage of his eye beneath the lower eyelid. The arrow had largely disappeared, with only its small tip, which adheres to the shaft, remaining.
It was a large arrow, from a composite bow, with a square, smooth iron head, lacking ears. The Jew recovered without any further eye problems. I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arab arrow.
It had two ears, and I split it open between the windpipes.  It had penetrated his throat, and I carefully worked on it until I extracted it. The Christian recovered.  I also removed another arrow from a man's abdomen, and we believed he would die from it.
After about thirty days, or thereabouts, and nothing had changed in his condition, I split open the arrow and worked on it, extracting it. He recovered and no further problems arose. I saw a man with an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
However, after seven years, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh.  I saw a woman who had an arrow lodged in her abdomen. The wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained. No change in her condition occurred, and she experienced no hindrance in her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow lodged in his face. The wound had closed over it, and he experienced little pain.  Many such cases exist.  I removed an arrow from a Sultan's commander who had an arrow lodged in the middle of his nose, slightly tilted to the right.
The arrow had completely disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow entered.  I found the arrow wound very narrow. I probed it with a fine probe but felt nothing. He was experiencing a prickling and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped this prickling was from a part of the arrow.  I dressed the area with a dressing to draw out and ripen the spot, hoping the area would swell and the arrow's location become apparent, so I could then cut into it.  However, nothing happened to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued to dress the wound for many days, but nothing happened.  Eventually, the wound healed completely.  The patient remained hopeless about removing the arrow for a while.  Until one day, he felt the arrow inside his nose.  He told me of this. I then applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it.  I felt a thin arrowhead stuck to the wood. I continued to enlarge the wound with that strong medicine until the arrowhead became visible.  This took approximately four months.
Then, when the wound had widened and I could insert forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it wouldn't come out.  I continued to manipulate it with various instruments until I grasped it with firm forceps, as will be illustrated later in the chapter.
The physicians had judged that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it.  The wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, suffering no further harm. I am telling you how to remove certain arrows so that this will serve as an example and guide for what I have not yet described.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped through description nor encompassed by a book.  Instead, the skillful craftsman draws parallels from the few to the many, from what is present to what is absent, and invents new methods and instruments to deal with unusual cases.
Concerning this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the members where they lodged in two ways: either by pulling them from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, emerging from where they entered.
If the arrow is protruding into fleshy tissue, it should be pulled out.  If it cannot be removed immediately, you should leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh has become inflamed, making its removal easier.  The same applies if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days and try pulling and moving it daily.  If it still does not come out after a few days, you should carefully pierce around the arrow in the same bone from all sides with a fine drill to widen the space for the arrow, then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull, penetrating one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I previously mentioned appear, do not pull the arrow out. Leave it for several days until the situation improves.
Proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply lodged and cannot be removed, use drills around the arrow as described earlier. Then treat the wound until it heals.  If the arrow is concealed in some part of the body... If it is hidden from the sense, search for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with appropriate instruments. If you cannot reach it due to the narrow wound and the arrow's deep penetration, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, ...
Cut it open to widen the wound, and then remove the arrow. If the arrow has two barbs, grab them. Remove the flesh caught on them from every side by any means you can.  If you cannot remove the flesh by breaking the barbs or twisting them, ...
When attempting to remove the arrow from any location, use your hand and forceps in all directions to extract it.  Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it harder to remove. If you cannot remove it within a reasonable time...
Leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh around it decays. Then try again; it will be easier by then.  If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in the relevant section, and be cautious to avoid cutting any vein, nerve, or tendon. Use ingenuity.
By any means possible, remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as described.  When pulling the arrow, the patient should be positioned as they were when the arrow struck, which is the optimal position.
If this is not possible, use whatever means are possible.  As for an arrow exiting from the opposite side, either something will be protruding outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow near the surface of the skin and see it protruding.
Cut the skin over it, keeping the incision to the size of the forceps. Then pull it out.  It will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, rotate your hand, so that it breaks the bone and creates space for the arrow.  Then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for several days and try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it out with it.  If the shaft has fallen out, and you want to push it out, insert a hollow instrument into the arrow's barb, and then push it out with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits inside the hollow.  The arrow will be easier to remove that way. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the affected flesh, if possible, and then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, cut and be careful not to sever a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to remove arrows:.
Its tips are like a bird's beak, crafted like a rasp so that when it grasps an arrow or anything, it does not release it.  Large, small, and medium sizes are made, depending on the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and its width.

Image of the solid cannon:.
This is solid at the end, like a roller, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-five.
On bloodletting.
The veins customarily bled in the body are thirty.  Of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *hasissin*; the two arteries in the temples, visible; and the two veins in the eye sockets, known as the *naazirin*.
The vein standing in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the tip of the nose; the two veins in the neck; the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth; the two veins in the lower lip; these veins, known as the *jayhark*; and the two veins beneath the tongue.
And as for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five. One of them is the *qayfal*, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head.  The *akhl*, which is the middle vein, is a composite of a branch of the *basliq* and a branch of the *qayfal*; the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the *basliq*, which is located on the inner side, is also called the axillary vein.  The common people call it the vein of the abdomen and the cord of the arm. It is situated on the forearm, and where it attaches it is clearly visible above the thumb.  And the *asīlim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches.  In the leg and foot there are three veins: one beneath the knee on the outer side; the second, the saphenous vein, located at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the *nisa*, located at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their incision is beneficial for chronic colds, migraine, scabies, and chronic, troublesome head sores; and I will describe how to make their incisions.
To do this, shave the patient's head and rub its back in the area of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well. Then the patient's neck is bound with a turban until the veins appear behind the ears, in the low parts of the head. Probe them with your finger, and where you feel a pulse under your finger, mark the spot with ink.
Then take a scalpel, the kind known as a lancet, and insert it under the vein into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin, making a complete severance.  The length of the cut should be the width of two clasped fingers.
Or thereabouts, and release the amount of blood you desire.  Then tie them with ligatures and leave them until healed.  I have described their cutting and cauterization in the beginning of the book. As for the arteries in the temples, their incision is beneficial for chronic migraine, severe headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and intense, persistent eye discharge.
Their incision, as I describe to you, involves binding the patient's neck with a turban until the veins clearly appear and their pulse is evident under your finger. Then mark the spot with ink.  Thereafter, raise the skin above the vein with your index finger.
Insert the lancet from below, lift the vein upwards, and sever it as you did with the other veins. Release the blood as needed. Then loosen the patient's neck restraint and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a compress and ligature on it, tying tightly from above. Leave it until it heals.  Their cutting and application have been previously mentioned in the beginning of the book.  As for the frontal vein, after incision of the cephalic vein, it is beneficial for chronic facial conditions such as sores, ulcers, and persistent redness.
Incision of this vein, as I describe to you, involves binding the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears. Then you take the instrument called the "axe" -- and this is its image:
Place the pointed tip of the axe on the vein, and strike from above with a chisel or similar object.  Allow the blood to flow as desired. Then release the patient's neck restraint, and secure a bandage to ensure healing.
It may be opened with a broad lancet, but it should not have a sharp tip like other lancets, rather it should be slightly broad-tipped.  Incision should be made in a slight oblique manner because the bone is close by; if the lancet is thin, it might break.
As for the veins located at the eye sockets, they are beneficial for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and other ailments, as well as facial maladies.  Their incision involves the patient binding their neck with a turban, while you stand over their head.  Make an incision, slightly oblique in a lengthwise direction, with a small, somewhat broad lancet.
If the area has little flesh, a thin-tipped lancet might break.  Then, draw off the desired amount of blood, place a bandage over the veins, and secure them for one night.  Then, remove the bandage.  As for incision of the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial ailments, such as the red swelling that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, may be treated by binding the patient's neck.  Then, hold the nose with your left hand and take a long, thin lancet.
Insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between the nasal septum, in a straight line.  Since the vein is not perceptible there, blood will emerge immediately.  You should push the lancet in slightly and draw off the desired amount of blood.  Then, bind it for a night, as it will clot quickly.
As for the veins on the sides of the neck, their incision is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic skin conditions such as dark vitiligo, scabies, and foul ulcers, and sores.  Their incision involves the patient tying a bandage around their neck beneath them, while the surgeon stands over the patient's head.
The patient sits in a chair, then the vein is incised lengthwise, with a somewhat wide incision.  Then, drain the moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed.  Then, repeat the process with the other vein.  Then, loosen the bandage.
Apply a moderate degree of pressure to the veins to prevent suffocation, and leave them until the following day; the wound will heal.  As for the veins on the temples, their incision, after incision of the temporal vein, is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, foul sores, chapped lips, and foul sores.
Those located in and around the nose.  The method of incision is to have the patient sit facing you, and tie their neck with a turban.  Then, turn their lips and look for the veins; one will be on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and recognize them by their blackness.
Around them are also thin black veins, and cut them off completely. If this is unclear, and you do not know which veins are which, focus on cutting the largest and clearest ones.  Do the same with the veins on the lower lip.
As for the two veins beneath the tongue, incision after incision of the temporal vein is beneficial for obstructions in the throat caused by diseases of the tongue and mouth diseases.  The method of incision is to have the patient sit before you, facing the sun.  Lift the tongue and look under the tongue on one side, and on the other side, for a vein.  Their colour is towards black.
Incise them and be careful, do not cut them deeply.  Below them are arteries, and there is a risk of bleeding from these arteries.  The three veins that are incised at the elbow are those commonly used for bloodletting among people. Incision of them has two approaches.
Either by a wide, aromatic lancet, or an olive-shaped one, to the depth; or by a surgical knife, with a sharp edge—that is, lancing—[and this is its illustration].  Illustration of the wide, aromatic lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, in order to be suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins, which contain thick, dark blood. This is the illustration of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening the thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood.  This is the illustration of the lancing lancet.
This lancing lancet, which is suitable for incision, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins.  It can be used as a model for other similar tools, and is well-known among practitioners.
And as for the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, towards the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist, when opening it, must be cautious and have a sense of its location.  If there is an artery beneath it, an error and further probing of the lancet could cut the artery.
This results in blood leakage, so it should not be opened with a lancet used for probing, but rather incised with a lancing lancet. If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, one should avoid it and turn to another vein or look for a branch of it.
Or open the brachial vein, which is clear, and incise it with the lancing lancet, as we said.  If you want to open it directly, you should, before tightening the arm, palpate the area to identify the pulse location, then mark it with ink.
Then, the arm is tied, and the vein is incised with a deviating cut using the lancing lancet, as we said.  Be sure that the incision is made away from the artery.  If, when tightening the bandage, you see a bulge in the area you marked with ink, this bulge is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during the venesection spurting like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood.  At that point, quickly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, often it will stop, then tighten the arm.
Leave it alone, and warn the patient not to neglect it. It should be placed on a pillow and not moved for several days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are unable to obtain a remedy quickly, cut off the artery if it is exposed.  Its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and use one half and firmly bind it to the vein location with bandages and splints until the next day.  If the bleeding stops, good. If not, treat it with the previously mentioned methods of applying cautery to stop the bleeding.  Stopping the bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because the wound is small and the bandage is secure on the arm, be aware of this.  As for the black vein, the benefit of its venesection is to draw blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we said.
The surgeon who performs the venesection should be careful to place the venesection on a pillow, for beneath it are nerves.  If the lancet penetrates too deeply and hits a nerve, numbness will result that is difficult to treat, and possibly will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible by touch.
If in some individuals it is hidden and delicate, not clearly visible, one should make a shallow incision with a lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible.  If the vein is between two nerves, incise the vein lengthwise.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its venesection is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein especially, if you wish to perform venesection, use the olive-shaped lancet or the broad, broad-leaved lancet, for it is the safest of all veins because there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, when performing venesection, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft area.  If the desired site is not struck on the first attempt, it will not be harmed to repeat the venesection several times, although it may swell in some individuals if not performed on the first attempt.
But that swelling does no harm.  Concerning the method of venesection, its effects, and what should be done to remedy them, first it must be understood that venesection is used either to preserve health alone.
And it is used in illnesses.  The venesection for preserving health and maintaining it, and preventing illnesses, should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely, the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital vein.  It should be performed at the beginning of spring, if signs of fullness appear.
Venesection should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  Venesection used for illnesses, however, has no specific time; it is performed when needed, regardless of whether it is day or night.
And at any hour and at any time.  Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years of age. If someone intends to perform venesection for any reason...
He should cleanse his bowels before venesection with a mild enema if there is much accumulated phlegm, so that foul matter from the intestines will not be drawn into the veins during venesection, harming the principal organs.  The hypochondriac, the drunkard, and the intoxicated should not be bled until these conditions have subsided.
One should also avoid venesection following dysentery, vomiting, diarrhoea, excessive sexual activity, exertion, exercise, late nights, fasting, and anything that weakens the body or mind.  Then, one should consider thinning the humours beforehand if the blood is thick.
Through foods, drinks, and medications, if possible.  Then, he should take a bath, if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood may become thin.  He should perform the venesection in the middle of the day, as we have said, and he should try to clear his mind of all bad feelings that day.
He should avoid worries, anger, and fear, and all bodily ailments such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, sexual activity, and the like.  He should prepare his environment with items commonly used by people—perfumes, flowers, and amusements—to the extent possible for each individual.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the one the patient sits on.  The phlebotomist then strokes the arm twice or thrice.  Then he tightens the tourniquet with the ligature and twists it twice or thrice, and the tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening prevents the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, the patient should rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and are visible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially.  Then he places his left index finger on the same vein slightly below the point where he intends to draw blood, so that the vein does not move and avoid the blow. For some veins are like tendons, moving when lanced, and some are filled with air; when the lancet is placed on them, they sink below the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. If it does open it, it is a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be cautious and meticulous in all of these matters.  Then he lowers the lancet. If the vein opens at that time, then [he should continue]. Otherwise, he returns to the same spot a little lower or higher, quickly, if the spot has not become swollen.
If the patient swells or feels pain, leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it might cause a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bath. Then he can repeat the procedure if he wishes. If the lancet pierces and the opening is small, and the blood flow is thin.
And if you fear that the amount of blood will not be sufficient, return to the same hole with the lancet gently and in a straight line, increasing the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area becomes swollen. For many people, a small opening can cause swelling.
If you see that it has swollen, do not return to it at all.  It will not help you. Apply some clarified oil to it.  It facilitates blood flow and is better in this situation than plain oil or other ointments.
Use clarified oil in all your phlebotomies when blood flow is difficult.  This remedy, and the *shakhznaya*, can also do this, if one of them is applied to the spot.  The blood will thin and liquefy if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for someone who has not been bled before or if the vein opening was small, quickly apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the swelling and bind it for an hour.  It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood has completely exited the vein itself or another vein.  If, after a few days, there remains some discoloration (blackness or greenness) at the site, it will not harm. If desired, apply some dissolved myrrh and aloes.
Or some of the juice of the *fūdanj* and the like.  A swelling and protuberance often occurs when bleeding the basil. If you place your hand on it, and find that it trembles when you touch it, that is a bad protuberance; beware of applying any of the things we have mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood, but bandage it with something that will constrict to firm the area, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  It is necessary to remove blood from each person in proportion to their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red.  Likewise, if you see it thick, allow it to flow until it becomes thinner, and if it is sharp, until its sharpness diminishes.  For those who are strong and full and need to remove the blood in one go...
To widen the vein incision, and have the lancet be broad; for the weak, the opposite.  It is necessary to remove it in stages and have the puncture narrow.  The best tool for vein incision is one that is slanted and oblique, a cut rather than a puncture.
This type of bleeding is free from hemorrhage and nerve damage.  It is better and safer than bleeding across or lengthwise.  If someone is prone to fainting during bleeding, it is necessary to give them something to eat beforehand, like bread soaked in pomegranate juice or sherbet.
If he is free from illness and the blood is removed in three or four stages, if his temperament is cool, let him eat bread soaked in myrrh drink or honey drink flavored with herbs or sweet, fragrant drink.
If fainting occurs during bleeding, and the cause is excessive blood loss, it is necessary to give him meat broth and a thin, fragrant drink.  Use fragrance with galbanum, and gently wash his chest with it.  Use all the methods mentioned in the section on fainting.
For those who are bleeding due to excessive vomiting, and whose strength is weak, if they wish to release their arm's blood again, it is necessary to gradually release the blood, little by little, according to their strength, over consecutive days.
If someone wishes to release their arm's blood a second time and their body is strong, they should do so after seven or nine hours from the first bleeding.  If someone wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite side from which it initially flowed, this should be done on the second or third day.
If a person has a large amount of hot, inflamed blood in their body, causing fever, it is necessary to remove a large quantity of blood in one single session, widening the opening until fainting occurs, after ensuring all the conditions for bloodletting are met. Place your hand on their pulse while the blood flows to prevent death instead of fainting.  This often occurs if the leeches are not careful and inattentive. This should not be done when intending to release the arm's blood a second time.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully prod or twist it; this is very harmful.  Instead, either leave it until it can be opened again, or use a lancet blade to remove the clotted blood from the vein opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a potent antidote (like theriac or shekhsnaiya), and gently prod the vein until the blood flows. If the vein has swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If further bloodletting is absolutely necessary, either open a new vein above the affected area, or bleed from the other arm or a different vein.
For bleeding the arm's vein, use the arm's vein instead of the vessels in the eye or temples, if those are not available or difficult to locate, since it is a combined vein from those. To perform this procedure, the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the forearm turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible; then the vein is gently constricted with a bandage.
Then, make a small incision across the vein, not lengthwise or outward, and make a wide opening.  Incise just above the wrist joint.  If blood flow is difficult, return the arm to the warm water basin and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you've achieved your desired amount.  If it's summertime, you may be able to avoid returning the arm to warm water.  Most often, placing the arm back in warm water is used in winter.  Bleeding from this vein is the safest of all veins. Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  Bleeding from the vein in the right forearm is helpful for liver ailments.  To perform this procedure, the wrist is bound with a bandage or your hand after the arm is immersed in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it.  Bleeding from the vein in the right forearm is helpful for liver ailments.  To perform this procedure, the wrist is bound with a bandage or your hand after the arm is immersed in warm water until the vein swells. The vein is very clearly visible. Then, make a slight incision across the vein.  Even if you cut it completely, it will not harm him.  Be careful; do not press too hard with the lancet, as there is a nerve to the fingers beneath it and the area is devoid of muscle. Then return the arm to warm water.
Leave it [the arm] to continue bleeding.  If you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and stop flowing.  Once you have extracted the desired amount of blood, apply a mixture of grease and salt to the vein to prevent it from closing quickly.
Likewise, this procedure should be followed for all constricted veins.  Bleeding from the left arm is beneficial for spleen ailments.  Do the same procedure as you did with the other vein.  As for bleeding from the saphenous vein, it is beneficial for illnesses in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.
And for menstrual irregularities, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  The procedure for bleeding from the saphenous vein is to immerse the leg in warm water, and apply massage until the veins become prominent.  Then, bind above the joint of the leg with a bandage.  The vein is located near the heel, roughly at the position of the thumb.
From it [the saphenous vein] many branches spread throughout the leg.  Make the incision on the widest branch, or near the heel where it joins, as this is the best and safest approach.  If you incise on the front of the leg, be cautious of the nerves below the surface on the front of the leg.
Make your incision by deflecting the vein, as if you are trying to sever it.  The lancet should be sharp.  If bleeding is difficult, return the leg to warm water and allow the blood to flow until it is emptied.  If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt.
If the surgeon misses the vein on the first attempt, then return to a point slightly higher on the vein.  The area is safe, and there is no danger, as long as the nerve is avoided, as we have mentioned.  The same procedure applies to the saphenous vein of the other leg.  As for the vein of Venus, its location, as we stated, is at the heel, on the outer side.
Its [the saphenous vein's] benefit is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood.  The procedure for bleeding is to have the patient enter a hot bath, then rapidly tighten the leg from the hip to above the heel with a thin, long bandage.  It will only appear then.
If it appears, then open it in any manner; either by deflecting it (which is best), or by cutting it off completely or by cutting it in half.  The location is safe.  In most people, it is extremely hidden.  If you do not find it.
If it does not appear at all, then open some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers.  Be careful of the nerves and release the amount of blood you desire.
Then release the bandage, place a compress on the incision site, and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-six.
On Cupping and its Use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping can be done in two ways: one by incision and bloodletting, and the other without incision.
This cupping without incision is of two types.
And the cupping vessels of the nape of the neck, the two sides of the neck, the chin under the lower jaw, the shoulders, the coccyx at the base of the spine, the elbows in the middle of the arms, the legs, and the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the fine veins spread throughout the flesh.  Therefore, it does not weaken the body as much as venesection, and cupping, whether by fire or otherwise, should not be used in any disease arising from fullness until the entire body is emptied.
If cupping is needed due to illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning, end, or middle of the month.
For some people, an excess of blood requiring cupping causes heaviness and headaches.  Others experience fullness, redness in the face, head, and neck. Some experience itching on the face, temples, and darkening, and heaviness in the eyes, and some experience itching at the cupping site.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, and have gums bleeding and spitting of blood. Others sleep excessively and see blood, redness, slain people, and wounds, and similar things in their dreams.  When we see any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of cupping the temple is in relieving heaviness in the head and water that flows to the eyes.
However, this should be done after the body has been emptied. This cupping can be a substitute for lancing the veins.  It should be avoided by those with a cold head or a cold, as it will do them great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly, or those with cold diseases in their heads, and those who habitually use it may develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly to avoid the development of forgetfulness.  As for cupping the shoulder, it is a substitute for lancing the temples and lancing the neck.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, splitting of the breathing apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The shoulder cup should be raised slightly, because if lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it is beneficial for pains in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, constriction, and toothache. It is a substitute for lancing the neck.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the cup too deeply, lest they cut an artery and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments. It may take the place of lancing the veins on the lips.  As for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearm, it is beneficial for what is beneficial for lancing the three veins: the neck, temples, and the crook of the arm, because it draws blood from all the delicate veins in the flesh and draws these delicate veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard, because the area is lacking in flesh and has nerves and arteries beneath.  As for a single cupping on the coccyx, it is beneficial for piles and sores of the lower parts.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, copper cup, as the area requires strong suction, and glass cups may break.  The cupping should be done vigorously.  As for cupping the legs, it diminishes fullness noticeably.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, inducing menstruation, and beneficial for boils and abscesses.  It acts as lancing the safenous and saphenous veins, but it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people.  Cupping the saphenous veins is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place the empty cup and apply moderate suction.  Do not prolong the application of the cups, but quickly place and quickly remove them to allow the humors to flow evenly to the area.  Repeat this process until the area reddens and opens.
When redness from the blood appears, then apply gentle pressure and resume suction gradually.  Then observe the condition of the body. For those with thin, porous flesh, a single pressure is sufficient, so that the area is not ulcerated.
The cupper should widen and slightly deepen the pressure, and adjust the suction gently and with slight movement. If the blood is thick, then it should be pressed twice. The first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood. And the second time to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, then the pressure should be repeated a third time to achieve the goal.  In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one pressure is sufficient.  If we want to remove a large amount of blood, we should apply more pressure.  If we judge the blood to be thick.
Therefore, a deep pressure should be applied. The moderate limit for pressure is just the depth of the skin. What ointments should be used when applying cupping, and what waters, and what the cupper should avoid?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and tight pores...
The areas for cupping should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving ointments.  In summer, for example, the ointment of the Khari, or violet ointment, or sweet almond ointment, or pumpkin seed ointment.
And in winter, for example, narcissus ointment, or lily ointment, or chamomile ointment, or hyacinth ointment, and the like. If the phlegm is thick and cold, the ointment should be of hellebore, or bindweed, or frankincense, or rue, and the like.
If the cupper has large pores and soft flesh, then the use of ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping vessels after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or elderberry water, or pumpkin water, or rue water, and the like.  And for those whose blood is excessively moist...
They should wash their vessels with vinegar, or with rue and sumac water, and the like.  And those whose phlegm is thick should wash their vessels with aged wine, or hellebore water, or rue or chamomile decoction, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and after the bath.
Rather, it should be performed one or two hours after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leeches should take care of before and after the procedure.
First, one must observe if the cupper or leech is bilious, and if their blood is predominantly hot and inflamed.  Then they should consume coolings such as pomegranate, dandelion (with vinegar), endive, mulled wine, gelab, and the like.  Their food should include chickens, lamb (including the stews and stewed meats), and the like.
And if their temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks and myrrh drinks or buzury mulled wine.  A moderate, fragrant wine, between old and new, should be consumed.  A reduction in food should be ordered, and their diet should consist of chickens, quails, sparrows, and pigeons (with a sauce).  On the day of cupping and bloodletting, drinks should be consumed more than food.
Sometimes, certain individuals should be given, before cupping or bloodletting, or afterwards,  a therapeutic antidote or musk medicine or sheeltha to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood.  This should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cupping without stipulations, these are cupping that are placed upon the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidneys, and the groin area.  Because these organs cannot tolerate stipulations, the intent is to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or we use it to dispel a cold wind that has gathered in an organ, such as placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel.  It loosens the organ, warms it, and relieves pain by dissolving that wind.
It can be placed on the kidneys if there is blockage or stones, because its strong suction may open the blockage or remove the stones from their position.  Similarly, it is done when placed on the liver and spleen, when wind affects them.  These cuppings may also be used empty, by suction alone.
It can be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of swelling.  This involves filling a large cupping with hot water alone, or water in which certain herbs suitable for this purpose have been cooked.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the method of cupping using fire.
Its opening should be two fingers wide, as illustrated.  Its depth should be half a span.  On one side, near the middle, there should be a small hole, the size of a needle's insertion, made of thick-rimmed Chinese or yellow brass.
Smooth, flat, and polished so as not to injure the affected area when placed on it.  There is a transverse, central depression of brass or iron in the middle for placing the candle in the fire.  Such cupping vessels can be made larger or smaller than described, according to the illness.
The practitioner must understand the proper size.  Cupping for children and thin individuals is different from that for men and those with larger bodies.  The method of applying this cupping vessel with fire to the area is to light a wick made of tightly wound linen or a small candle of pitch and place it in the center of the hardened rod (in the center of the cupping vessel).
To allow the heat to rise from the bottom of the cupping vessel to prevent burning the patient.  Then place the cupping vessel on the affected area and hold the finger over the hole we previously mentioned, so that when we hold the cupping vessel, the finger does not need to be removed.
Steam will emerge through that hole, and the cupping vessel will be detached from the area.  Then light the wick again as needed.  However, the cupping vessel used for dropsy is without a hardened rod or hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the area only.  This is its form.
The larger the cupping vessel, the better it is, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
On applying leeches.
Leeches are used primarily on areas where cupping cannot be applied, either because of their small size, like the lip, gums, and similar parts, or because the area is lacking flesh, like the finger and nose, and similar parts.
To use them, select leeches from clean, uncontaminated freshwater, then leave them in fresh water for a day and night to become hungry and empty their stomachs. Then the body is first bled by venesection or cupping, then the affected area is cleansed.
Until it turns red, then a leech is placed on it. When it is full, it will fall off.  If it is possible to draw the affected area with a cupping device, that is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze. If bleeding continues after the leeches fall off and it is a trickle, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Apply it over the area until the bleeding stops. If there is a lot of blood, sprinkle crushed alum, or cinquefoil, or similar astringents, over it to stop the bleeding, or place peeled halves of lentils on the area.
Leave it until the lentils adhere to the area, and the bleeding will stop. If reapplication of leeches is needed, and other leeches are available, do not use the same leeches again. If the leeches refuse to attach, cleanse the area with fresh blood.
Or, insert a needle into the area until some blood comes out, then place a leech.  If it senses blood, it will attach. When you want it to detach, sprinkle some powdered sorrel, salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off.
The Third Chapter.
On Fractures.
This chapter, too, is necessary for the practice of medicine, dealing with the setting of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, O my children, that many ignorant physicians and laypeople claim expertise in this chapter, those who have never studied the writings of the ancients on it or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge is lost in our land, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner of it. However, I have gained what I have gained through extensive reading of the writings of the ancients and diligently understanding them until I extracted this knowledge. Then, I dedicated myself to practice and apprenticeship throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. And after I have brought it close to you and relieved it of prolixity, my experience has been applied to it, condensing it to the utmost brevity, clarifying it with utmost clarity, and illustrating for you many images of the instruments used in it.
This is an addition to the explanation, as I did in the previous two chapters. There is no power except with God, the Exalted, the Great.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and collections of the matter of fractured bones, which should be presented before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one.  Before we begin to discuss the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary to present in the beginning of this chapter a collection of statements and sections. This will first compel you, and anyone else eager to learn this noble craft, to understand them and grasp their truth.
So I say, whenever a fracture, dislocation, injury, or fall occurs, one must first hasten to splint or reduce it, or both. Unless prevented by something like weakness, or the person affected was a child or an old man, or the time was extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, their diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, and overeating are forbidden, along with any food that excessively fills the veins with blood, until the swelling subsides and there is no longer a concern of further fluid build-up at the site.
Then, the patient should return to their original diet, as was their custom. If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should eat foods that are rich, thick, strong, and viscous, such as rice, barley, wheat, and beef stomachs. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar foods, will result in faster and better healing of the fracture. Know that fractured bones in strong men and the elderly cannot fully connect and heal to their original state.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones, some fractured bones, even those as pliable as the bones of young children, might still connect and heal.  However, nature forms a substance around the fractured bone, similar to glue, which is thick and causes the bone fragments to adhere and hold together.
This holds the pieces together until it reaches the original strength and solidity, so that nothing hinders its functions.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are strong, viscous, and thick, as we have mentioned.  Know that the types of fractures vary according to the different body parts, for example, a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone differs from a fracture of the spine.
Likewise, all other parts of the body differ. We will describe each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the type of bone fracture itself can also vary.
Because a fracture may be a simple break without fragments, or it may be a lengthwise break with fragments, detached and non-detached splinters.  The fracture may also occur with a wound and tear in the skin, or it may be a slight crack.
Each type requires a specific method of reduction, which will be described in detail in its proper place.  Signs of a bone fracture include its deformity, unevenness, visibility to the touch, and creaking sound when you gently tap it with your hand.
If there is no visible deformity, creaking, or discomfort when palpating the bone, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture, but possibly a strain, a minor fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore, it is absolutely not advisable to move it by pulling or tapping it.
Instead, apply the appropriate medications, which will be mentioned later, to the area, and then gently bind it.  Know that if a bone breaks into two without fragments, each piece is separated from its counterpart.
You should immediately realign and straighten it before a hot swelling develops.  If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for several days until the swelling subsides, then gently realign it by any suitable means.
Know that reduction and realignment are easier when there are no fragments in the bone.  Then, it will be bound as described later. If there are fragments in the bone, the fractured limb (arm or leg) must be stretched from both sides.
Either by your hands, if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and your hands.  Position the limb on a level surface in its natural shape.  Once the fractured bone fragments have been stretched, carefully return the fragments to their proper positions by any method you can devise with gentleness.
Take great care to avoid causing the patient pain or discomfort in your actions.  Your effort should be to bring the two bone pieces together in the best possible alignment.  At that time, you should touch and feel them with your hands. If you find anything out of place, correct and adjust it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many unskilled practitioners do.  Often, they cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb with their actions, as I have repeatedly observed.
After the realignment, careful treatment, and stretching, keep the limb still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness or sleep, when turning over, or experiencing restlessness, and during bowel movements, and with all his movements to the greatest extent possible.  Ensure that the limb is held in a position that minimizes pain.
If, while the limb is held in that position, the patient feels pain or discomfort, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain.  He should ensure that this new position is straight and aligned.
So that no crookedness occurs in the limb if it is forced.  As for the method of stretching a fractured limb, it is as I describe to you.  Know that fractured limbs vary in size, condition, and configuration.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar parts...
The bandages should be soft and gentle for small parts like the arm and fingers.  For larger parts like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be firm and strong.  A wide bandage is needed for a large limb, to hold it firmly from all sides, without any gaps.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Begin by applying a soft splint to the fracture site.  Then, wrap the bandage around the fracture three or four times, depending on the limb's requirements.  Slightly tighten the bandage, and then move it up towards the upper part of the fracture.
Tighten the bandage less than you did for the fractured area, then move the wrapping away from the fracture site a little and gradually loosen the tension until a proper alignment is achieved.  Then, take another bandage and wrap it similarly over the fractured area.
Wrap the bandage further, moving towards the lower part of the fracture. Maintain the tension and looseness of the wrap as described for the initial, upper wrap.  Place soft splints or cloths between the layers of bandage to correct any bends or misalignments in the fracture.
If there is any misalignment, do not add anything; otherwise, apply another bandage. Then, if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb, apply firm bandages over these layers.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and remove the puffiness. Allow it time to settle, then apply firm bandages, which can be fashioned from appropriately shaped and cut reeds or from ebony wood.
Made of pine, palm fronds, papyrus, or similar readily available materials,  each splint should be of the same size and shape.
However, the splint placed directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others. The length of the splint should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Image of splint:.
Then, apply another bandage over the splints, tightening it to the same degree as the first bandage.  Secure them from above with strong threads, ensuring the tightening is particularly strong over the fractured area. The tighter the bandaging, the closer to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and not too thin, preferably made of damp flax.  Threads made from tightly twisted flax strips, as some unlearned individuals do, are a serious mistake.
Because this results in excessive tightening.  Thin threads are also unsuitable, as you cannot achieve the desired tension.  There should be at least a finger's width of separation between the splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening them properly, place soft padding or fluffy wool beneath them so that nothing causes discomfort.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin is broken, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be bandaged from the first day.  For a large limb, splints should not be applied until five or seven days, or even longer, depending on whether you are confident that inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages used by the ancients for fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a general, concise bandage suitable for fractures and adaptable to most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take the flour dust, the residue from the millstones, and knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then dry it.
Another bandage for fractures, dislocations, and sprains is made from: ten dirhams each of mastic, gum ammoniacum, acacia, frankincense, and myrrh; five dirhams each of gum arabic and licorice; twenty dirhams of Egyptian frankincense; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix with Egyptian frankincense water, or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Then apply this bandage; it is well-suited, quickly sets broken bones, and is appropriate for most people due to its balanced nature.
Another bandage useful for fractures and sprains is made from: ten dirhams each of myrrh, mastic, and white hellebore; five dirhams each of gum arabic and licorice; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white, then apply.
A bandage for dislocated joints and bones, relieving the pain of such dislocations, bone fractures, and skull fractures:  take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.  This bandage does not have the strength to set a fracture.
However, it is excellent at relieving hot swelling and pain in particular. Another bandage for setting broken bones: take the leaves of the fig tree and the leaves of the wild poppy, grind them both together, and apply as a damp compress.  A further, brief bandage is used when a fracture is displaced.
If you want to treat the remaining swelling, take root of hellebore, chamomile, violet, and caraway seed, all in equal parts. Grind together and mix with paint if the limb is not inflamed; if inflamed, mix with coriander water or water, and apply.
Another stronger resolving bandage, used when a hard swelling occurs following a displaced fracture, is made by taking equal parts of hellebore root, flaxseed, fenugreek, basil,  violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and mix with vinegar water, or plain water, or paint, depending on the heat of the limb and the relief of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb when setting it.
However, the plaster made of wax and oil, nothing more, should be of medium thickness.  Galen believed that when setting a fractured limb, one should apply things with dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar things.
A remedy for weakness and pain: take mugwort, chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, hellebore, and salt, all in equal parts. Grind, sieve, mix, and apply as a bandage.  As for the proper amount of remaining ligament...
Then, it should be resolved.  Observe if the patient experiences no pain, no rubbing, and no movement of the fractured bone from its position.  Do not dissolve it for many days.  However, if there is severe rubbing, disturbing pain, or swelling at the location,
Immediately dissolve it at once and do not delay. Remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching subsides and the pain ceases.  Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bandage it overnight to relieve inflammation and swelling and pain.  Then return it to a gentle bandaging and a light dressing.  Do not apply the initial tight bandage.
And care for it until it heals.  If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and swelling have completely disappeared, and you need a bandage and tension, then repeat what you did initially. If nothing mentioned previously occurs in the limb,
then do not dissolve it until after three, four, five, or seven days. It may sometimes take twenty days, all according to what appears to you from the condition of the limb as we have said, until the fracture is stabilized and the flesh heals over it.
Then, increase the tension of the bandage further than your original dressing and also increase the patient's nutritional intake as previously mentioned. If you see the fracture site has dried out and wasted more than necessary, understand that nourishment cannot reach it.
Then loosen it with lukewarm water each time you unwrap it, and let that be every three days. Reduce the bandage tension slightly. By doing this, nourishment will reach the limb and it will heal quickly.  As for what the ignorant among the bone setters do, by breaking the limb again...
For if it is not properly set the first time, and it is set crookedly, that is an error on their part and a great deception.  Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it. I have never seen any effect of that from any of them. The correct approach is not to use it.
Chapter Two.
In fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous and varied in form, and their causes are diverse. Some fractures are caused by sword blows, and in these cases, the bone may be completely broken, extending to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As the carpenter does with wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "carpenter's fracture".  Alternatively, the sword might only cut a part of the bone, breaking only its surface, without penetrating to the end, and this is called a simple fracture.  The wound of either type of fracture may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by a blow or impact with a stone, or a fall on a stone or similar object.  This fracture may be penetrating, approaching the membrane under the bone, or it may be superficial, affecting only the surface of the bone.
The wound of these fractures may also be large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, a slight fissure or crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  A fracture can result from a fall or impact with a stone or similar object, causing a portion of the bone to penetrate inward, creating a depression, similar to how a blow to a copper object can cause a portion of it to sink inward.
This is most often seen in the soft skull bones of children.  All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments, and we will discuss the treatment for all of these in their respective sections, and we will identify all these types of fractures through examination.
Inspecting them with probes and removing any putrid flesh.  The hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink, for the fracture will appear dark.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe evident symptoms of danger, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bloodshot and red eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat the patient, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and hope for his recovery, then take action in his treatment. This is so that if the injured person comes to you at the very beginning of the injury, and that was during the winter months...
In any case, you should strive to remove the bone before the 14th day. If it is during the summer months, you should hasten to remove the bone before the 7th day, before the membrane beneath the bone deteriorates, causing the symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is a crushing and contusion, then you should cut away the crushed and contused portion, as I am describing to you—that is, shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the shape of the wound and the patient's tolerance. If, during the exposure, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, address it appropriately.
This is done by filling the area with cloths soaked in rose-water and ointment.  Clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding is controlled.  Then, begin to manipulate and extract the bone.  This can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, delicate incision.  This is how it is done:
Then, use another cut, slightly wider than the first.  This is how it is done:
Then use yet another cut, wider than the second.  You should have several differently-sized incisions, some wider and some narrower, with extremely sharp edges.  They should be made from Indian steel or good quality wrought iron.
Use gentleness when striking the incision to avoid disturbing the head and injuring it.  If the bone is strong and hard, it is advisable to pierce around it with a  "non-immersive" drill before using the incisions.
Because it does not pierce beyond the skull's bone, since the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, like a ring or small circle, which prevents it from sinking in and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that for every skull, you have a drill whose sharp tip is the correct length and width for the thickness of that skull.  Here is an image of three types. Of the drills, large, medium, and small.
As for how to pierce around the fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.  Then move the drill to another spot, placing it at a distance equivalent to the thickness of a rod or similar.
Then, use the chisels to cut between each pair of holes.  Do this with as much gentleness as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with another instrument you have prepared for that purpose.
Such as splints and delicate forceps.  You must be extremely careful that the drill or chisel does not touch the periosteum.  If you have smoothed the bone and separated it from the periosteum, if it was attached, and removed it, you should then strip it.
And smooth any roughness remaining on the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel, but it should be thinner and gentler than the other chisels. If any small fragments or splinters of bone remain, remove them gently with the instruments you have.
Then treat the wound afterward with the compresses and ointments that are mentioned.  As for the other aspect of the procedure, it is truly easy, free from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it highly.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the section of bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that section, position the tip of this lens-shaped chisel beneath it. This is its image/form:.
The lens-shaped portion should be smooth, not cutting anything. The sharp portion of the chisel should be along its length, as you see, so that the lens-shaped portion rests against the periosteum and the sharp edge of the chisel faces the bone. Then strike the chisel from one side.
With a small hammer, so that all the bone is cut gently, as it turns, and you are safe from injuring the membrane, no dangerous accident will occur at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of men, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the tip of the lens-shaped chisel itself, and remove it gently; it will come away without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not penetrate the membrane, and the broken surface of the bone remained rough and with slivers, it is necessary to remove that roughness and those slivers with delicate instruments, different sizes, so that you can use the most appropriate one for each place according to the requirements of the work.
The bone, fractured and shaped as it is, you should use the widest of these instruments first for scraping the bone, then use a finer one after that, and continue in this manner until you reach the use of the finest and most delicate of them all.
As for the other small, hairline fractures and subtle breaks, each should be treated according to what will restore it to soundness. This is something that is not hidden from anyone who has even a minimal skill in this craft and has paid attention to what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, dip it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Dip it [the second cloth] in rose water and oil, place it on the first cloth, and do this with the utmost gentleness to avoid weighing down the peritoneum.  Then, use a wide bandage over it, tightening only enough to hold the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until the hot swelling subsides.  Then, remove it and use thereafter the drying remedies such as iris root, quince flour, pulverized kender, and zarand, and similar ones.  These remedies should be prepared as poultices.
And sprinkle them [the remedies] on the wound, dry as they are. In general, use a remedy that cleanses without stinging.  Be very diligent in treating the wound to ensure it is clean, free of grease, grime, or pus.  Do not allow pus to accumulate within it at all.
Because if pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, causing great harm to the patient.  This may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is certainly doomed. If the discoloration was caused by a remedy applied to it, and that remedy had the power to produce such discoloration.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, thoroughly mix them, and apply them to a cloth.  Then place this cloth on the peritoneum.  Then treat it with the appropriate types of treatment until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a fractured nose.
Know that the only parts of the nose that can fracture are both or one of the upper cartilages, because they are bones.  The lower part is cartilage and cannot fracture, but it may be bruised, bent, or perforated.
If one of the cartilages is fractured, you should insert the little finger into the nostril.  Straighten the fracture from inside with your index finger and from outside with your thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape.  Be gentle in your actions, taking care not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with a rounded instrument of moderate thickness. If the fracture is in both sides, do likewise.  The fracture should be treated on the first day after it occurs.
If possible, or else after seven or ten days when the acute swelling has subsided, introduce a thread of linen into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two threads if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the threads be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some earlier surgeons suggested soaking the threads in clarified butter and changing them daily.  I do not agree with this; rather, the threads should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then the threads are left in place until the bone is firmly set and the cartilage solidified.  After the thread is in place, goose feather tubes wrapped in soft linen can be inserted into the nostril.  This will hold the fracture more securely, and prevent the patient from having difficulty breathing.
This is not a necessary procedure.  You can either use the threads or do without them. If during the procedure a hot swelling appears on the nose, apply a compress of fine linen or cotton dipped in vinegar, rose oil, or some kind of diachylon ointment to the nose.
If no hot swelling occurs, it is appropriate to apply a compress externally made of fine semolina and crushed kandar mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it.  Do not bind the nose at all; if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it splintered, the fragments must be extracted using an appropriate instrument, then the gap sutured and treated with ointments that promote healing and suppuration.  If a wound develops inside the nose, it should be treated with threads and lead tubes. Until it heals.
Fourth chapter.
On the setting of the lower jaw if fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured, but not accompanied by an open wound, if the fracture is only external, and not fractured in two, and has not deviated inward, then its knowledge is easily obtained.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is in the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted, and the bump of the fracture should be gently lifted from inside to outside.
With your other hand outside the bone, you should control its alignment. If the jaw fracture has splintered into two, then traction must be applied from both sides in a straight line until alignment is achieved. If it has affected the teeth, they will have grown.
Or if it has separated, tie what you hope will remain together with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then place a splint over the fractured jaw, then a folded cloth, and over that a large, tight bandage or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to how you are able to tie it and align it so that it does not become dislocated. Tell the patient to rest and remain still, and provide him with soft food.  If you suspect a change in shape in any way, proceed to remove it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to how you are able to tie it and align it so that it does not become dislocated. Tell the patient to rest and remain still, and provide him with soft food.  If you suspect a change in shape in any way, proceed to remove it on the third day. Then, after removing the splint, correct the area with flour dust and egg white, or semolina flour, and place a soft bandage over the dressing.  As long as the bandage adheres and the bone's condition does not change, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the fracture heals and strengthens.  This fracture often strengthens within three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use the methods we have mentioned repeatedly to relieve it until it subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, if a piece or pieces of bone have become detached, carefully remove those pieces using a tool suitable for the task. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, if you have removed the pieces of bone and nothing remains, suture the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for the wound. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of a fractured collarbone.
The collarbone is most often fractured from the front, at the acromial end.  Its fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters with two fragments without splinters, which is easiest to treat;
Or the fracture may have splinters, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants.  One should hold the arm adjacent to the fractured collarbone, and the other should extend the neck toward the opposite side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, and there are no protrusions or irregularities. If more traction is needed, place a ball of lint or wool under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone as needed, and pull and elevate the collarbone.  Press on the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the collarbone outward because it has been driven inward, the patient should lie on their back.
Place a medium-sized cushion under the patient's shoulder.  The assistant should press down on the shoulder, so the deep-seated collarbone bone is elevated.  Then correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the collarbone has broken off and is moving, gently remove the splinter. If the splinter is lodged within the bone, use one of the instruments prepared for cutting it out. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm, which is made of wood or iron, under the collarbone, this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon, without any twists. Its width should be adjusted according to the size of the bone, and its length according to the necessary work. Let it have two ends, as you see, one wider and the other narrower.
If the wound you made when removing the bone splinter is wide and a hot swelling is present, stitch the edges of the wound together. If the opening is small or if you fear a hot swelling, cover the wound with strips and dressings according to the size of the opening.
If a hot swelling is present, soak the strips in rose-water and vinegar or a drink, and apply them.  As for the tightening of the bone, if there is no wound or opening, apply a dressing made from mill dust mixed with egg white to the bone. Place the soft splint on it. Then, if needed, place the ball under his armpit.  Then, take a very long turban, whose width is a span or thereabouts.  Then, apply a folded bandage over the splint and dressing.  Then, take a splint made of thin wood. Make its width three fingers' breadth and its length the same. Then wrap it in a cloth. Then wrap that cloth and the splint in the part of the turban that covers the fracture site. Then, tighten the turban over the fracture, as you would wrap it. Wrap it around his neck and under his healthy and affected armpits, and return it repeatedly in each direction.  As you see, the tightness ensures a firm hold on the fracture, and this should be clear to you.
And the whole aim is that the splint not be removed from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligament loosens and you see that the splint has shifted, correct this and tighten the bandage.  Then, have the patient sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their armpit when sleeping at night.
To raise the arm from the side, so that the fractured collarbone is elevated to the level of the shoulder, or tie the arm to the neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs in the area within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason to do so. Maintain the tension and leave it until the fractured collarbone is healed and consolidated, and it strengthens and becomes more solid within twenty-eight days. It may be in some people in less time than that.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its broad area; rather, its bony projections fracture.  Whenever a part of it is fractured, or it is broken in its middle, this is determined by touch.  Therefore, according to the appearance of the fracture, apply a splint.
Bring it back to its natural shape by every means possible, then apply powdered millstone, egg white, and softened clay to the area.  Place a folded cloth pad on top, then apply a wide splint made of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder, or a little wider.  If under the splint, there is a depression in any part of the shoulder, smooth that depression with soft clay until the splint lies flat.  Then secure it from above with a long bandage.
Apply a firm bandage and secure the splint so it does not move from its place.  Examine the bandage daily; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted.  The patient should lie on their healthy side.  The shoulder will be healed in twenty days.
For a day or twenty-five days.  If this period is completed, loosen the bandage and you are safe.  It is a bone that one does not fear shattering or dislocation.  If a piece of bone protrudes and is piercing the skin, cut around it and remove it. Do as described for the fractured collarbone in relieving any inflammation that may occur.
Chapter Seven.
For the setting of fractured ribs.
The chest can fracture in its middle, though this is infrequent.  Its extremities are more prone to breakage and fragmentation.  Symptoms of a fractured mid-chest include a downward slant, intense pain, and difficulty breathing and coughing.
There may be blood expulsion, and the depression of the fractured bone will be apparent, easily felt.  To set the fracture, the patient should lie on their back with a cushion between their shoulders.  Then, their sides should be pressed down, and the ribs should be brought together with the hands from both sides.  Efforts should be made to realign the fracture from all possible angles.
Maintain this until the bone returns to its proper shape. Then, apply a bandage and splint, placing a light splint of thin board, such as poplar or willow, or similar material, over the bandage. Then, carefully tie the splint to the fractured bone to prevent its shifting.  Wrap the bandage around the back in a circular fashion, repeatedly tightening it firmly.  The bandage should be checked frequently, and tightened if it loosens.
If the injury necessitates removal of the splint due to swelling, pain, or inflammation in the area, remove it immediately and address the affected area appropriately.  Then, reapply the bandage if deemed necessary. Apply a dressing and maintain pressure until healed.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures typically occur in the thick portions of the ribs adjacent to the spine and their anterior ends.  This is because they are cartilaginous, and pressure is often applied due to impact.  Palpation will reveal this, and its recognition is readily apparent.
To treat the fracture, align the fractured ends of the rib with the fingers to restore its proper shape.  Then, apply a dressing and support the fractured bone with a splint, if necessary. If the rib fracture is inwards, the patient will experience severe pain.
And the pain is like the pain of those with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the diaphragm, causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and significant blood spitting.  This is a difficult condition to treat, and many past practitioners tried various approaches for it.
Some have suggested that the patient should eat foods that produce gas and wind to inflate the abdomen and push the fractured rib outward.  We do not recommend this, lest it further inflame the condition if it has not already begun. If the inflammation has already occurred, this would only exacerbate and confirm it.
Some others suggested applying a cupping device to the area, then applying strong suction.  This is similar to a logical approach, but there is a concern that the cupping device might be pulled unintentionally to the area due to its weakness.  Others suggested covering the area with wool dipped in hot oil.
The ribs become filled in the space between them, so that the ligaments will be aligned when wrapped around the rib cage. Then the patient is treated with the treatment for pleurisy, both with diet and medicine.  If the patient's condition is severe and unbearable. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, we should cut open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place the device that protects the peritoneum (as previously described) beneath it.  Then gently cut the bone and remove it.
Then we stitch the edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If a hot swelling appears during this time, quickly apply rose-oil poultices to the area and treat the patient internally with something to relieve the swelling.
He should lie on the side where he sleeps more comfortably until he is healed.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if they are fractured, it rarely happens; most commonly they are injured by contusion.  Likewise, the vertebrae of the back. If this occurs to someone and you want to know if they will heal or not... Then observe. If you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move, extend, or grasp them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels nothing, and finds no pain in them, know that in most cases he will not recover; he is doomed.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking, know that the spinal marrow has remained unharmed, and the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected, and you wish to know if they will recover, too.
Then look at his legs. If you see that they are relaxed and the same has happened to them as to the hands, and then, when he lies on his back, wind and stool come out involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he cannot do so, know that he is doomed, so do not bother with treatment. If nothing like this occurs to him, the matter is less serious. Treatment for what has happened is to try to alleviate the inflamed swelling.
By placing rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, on the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the inflamed swelling subsides.  Then apply a strengthening, dry dressing to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he is healed. If a splinter or something else has formed in the bone from the injury, you should cut through the skin and remove that bone fragment. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with stitches. Then treat it with healing ointments until healed. If the other coccyx bone (the tailbone) is broken, you should insert the little finger of your left hand into the rectum.
Then, using the other hand, adjust the broken bone as much as possible and achieve alignment.  Then apply a bandage and splint, if necessary, and bind it tightly.
If you feel a fractured splinter in it, cut open the area and remove it. Treat the wound with the previous methods until healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Fractures of the hip bones are rare. If a fracture does occur, it usually involves splintering at the ends, longitudinal splitting, and inward tilting.  The patient experiences pain, pricking, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, run your hand over it to determine the nature of the fracture.  If the fracture is only at the ends, adjust the ends until they resemble their normal shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach until you are able to set the fracture.  Once you have adjusted it, apply a bandage and then a splint of wood or leather, securing it firmly.
Do not fear the fracture shifting or the splint loosening.  Fill the hollows of the waist with something that will provide support for the splint until it is properly positioned.  Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side, if a hot swelling develops.
Refrain from manipulating or setting it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply something to soothe it, as previously described. Then, resume setting and securing it properly. If fragments or splinters of bone are visible at the ends, they should not be removed.
Do not touch it [the bone], but adjust it from the outside, as we said, and leave it secured until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, set it using one of two methods. One method is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, like this:
And tie straps to its ends.  Then suspend it from a high point. The patient sits on a chair, and then places their fractured arm on the stick so that their armpit lies against the middle of the stick's curve.  Then hang a heavy object from above it.
Or, a servant pulls it downward. Then the physician straightens the fracture with his hands until the fracture is put back in place.  The other method is that the patient lies on their back, and their arm is suspended from their neck by a strap.
Then instruct two servants, one to hold the upper part of the fracture in their hands, and the other to hold the lower part, and each to pull in their direction. If you wish the pulling to be stronger, tie a strap under the fracture and another over it, and have each servant pull in their direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the center of the strap should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the strap should be in that location and on the elbow itself.
Then gently straighten the fracture without force, until the fracture is correctly aligned and joined together well. Then tighten it, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling does appear, leave tightening until the seventh day. Apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil to it.
Until the swelling subsides.  Then tighten it.  The method for tightening is to place the bandage over the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth bandage over that, then bring the arm up to the upper arm, and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the cloth and the tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and if nothing changes about the broken bone.  If you fear something may change about the broken bone, use splints.
That is, place a splint over the fracture itself, which is wider and stronger than other splints.  Let there be a space of one finger's width between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an extra three fingers' width on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening described in the first section.
The tightening should be stronger on the site of the fracture.
The further from the fracture, the less the tightening should be. If you see the placement of the splints and the tightening as we described when you set the limb, do so.
If you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the ligaments every three days, lest a rash or puffiness occur at the site, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening. All of this can be corrected with what we have described.
If you are confident that none of this will happen, do not loosen the bandage until many days later. The patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their stomach.  A padded armrest filled with wool, properly positioned, should be placed under the elbow.
Examine at all times, night or day, lest the fractured limb's shape change or the bandage loosen.  Correct everything with your effort.  Make the patient's diet as we previously described: First, let the food be gentle, until the bone is strengthened.
Then the diet should be thickened.  The arm and leg usually strengthen in forty days.  At that time, the bandage should be loosened, and the patient should use a bath and be treated with ointments appropriate for this.  If the fracture is severe and extensive.
Do not loosen the bandage until fifty days, or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
In setting a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the radius. One is small, and is the one next to the thumb; the other is large, and is placed beneath the smaller one below.  A fracture may occur in the larger radius alone, or in the smaller radius alone, or in both together.
If the upper small radius is fractured, then setting it is easy, and healing is quicker. If the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is bad and healing is difficult.  Worst of all is when both bones are fractured.  If the fractured bone is the upper small radius.
Therefore, the physician, in setting it, should make the traction gentle, so as to align it. If the larger radius is fractured, the traction should be stronger. If both radii are fractured, the traction must be considerably stronger.
When setting and pulling, the hand should be positioned on a pillow, extended. The thumb of the hand should be positioned higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated upright.
Let the pillow be at his height so that the patient does not strain himself.
Then an attendant stretches the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant stretches it from above.  Then the physician aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible position. If the fracture contains splinters, they are removed.
Return each splinter to its place to the best of your ability. If a splinter protrudes, piercing the skin, and you cannot hope to set it, then cut into it and remove it as described previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section is devoted to it.
Then take treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears during the initial setting, apply a cloth soaked in rose-oil and white wax ointment (qiyruṭī). Let it be of medium thickness, and apply the cloth gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the qiyrutī and apply a bandage prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white.  Then apply the splints.  The splint placed directly over the fracture itself should be somewhat wider and stronger. Know that an arm usually requires six splints.
The fracture may be in one radius or in both.  Then make your traction on the fracture site stronger and tighter.  As you move the traction upwards or downwards, gradually loosen the traction, as previously mentioned in the beginning of the chapter.
The cloths used to wrap the fracture should be soft, damp, and not overly stiff.  The thread used for tying should be fine linen, of medium thickness as described.  Inspect the limb and ligaments after several days.
If anything needs correcting, such as an irritation appearing on the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the irritation subsides.  Leave the limb unbandaged overnight for rest, then resume traction.
If the traction has become too loose and the bone has shifted, or similar problems have arisen, correct it to the best of your ability.  Also, if the limb is deprived of nourishment due to excessive traction, loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days until nourishment reaches it, then tighten it again.
If the patient experiences none of the aforementioned problems, the bandage should not be removed until twenty days or thereabouts.  Then, hang the patient's arm from his neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should avoid strenuous movements and sleep on his back.
Know that this arm fracture will be healed in thirty days, or thirty-two, or perhaps in twenty-eight days, all depending on the patient's temperament and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of fractured hand and fingers.
The metacarpals and phalanges of the fingers are rarely fractured, but often bruised.  When the hand is fractured or bruised.
The patient should sit on a stool, with a chair in front of him at the same level.
Then he places his hand on it, extended, and the attendant of the fractured bones extends it, and the physician straightens it until it is properly aligned.  Then, if there is no hot swelling, the bandage and splint should be applied, and then a brace should be placed over the area.
Wrap it in a soft cloth; if the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape from cloth, and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand, then tie it with a long cloth.
The brace should be made of soft leather, so that the skin can adjust with the bending of the entire hand, and it should be tied as needed. If the fracture is outward, then a brace should be placed above, and another below, in the hand, so that the hand remains open and upright.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand rotates, and tied between the fingers with a bandage. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, align it correctly and then tie it with the hand.  If you wish, a small, upright brace may be placed to support the fracture.
Do not move it. If the fracture is in other fingers like the middle, index, ring, or little finger, align them and bind them with the healthy adjacent finger or bind them together. That is better, or place a small upright splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, and examine after the fracture is set, and avoid the hot swelling.  Apply the appropriate remedy if anything of that sort occurs, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On setting a fractured thigh.
The thighbone frequently fractures and is evident to the touch because it shifts back and forth.  Setting it involves applying a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, while the patient lies on their face.
Then each bandage's attendant stretches it toward its side, equally, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft bandage, either of wool or the like, should be applied.
At the origin of the thigh, towards the pubis, the stretch should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee so that the stretch is downwards.  Then, the physician should align the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural form.
The bone will heal well.  At that time, the dressing and bandage should be maintained, unless a hot swelling develops in the limb. If swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, and then return to treatment.
As for the bandage, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or three times, leaving some excess. Then the leg should be wrapped until the heel is at the origin of the thigh, and a long thread should be inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread extending above on both sides.
Then, wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Next, place splints on the thigh, at the location of the fracture itself, and make one splint on the leg bone.  Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloth so that the bandage is even.
Then begin with a strong bandage, three or four turns, at the center of the fracture site.  As you move the bandage away from the fracture site, make the tension less, softer, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie them to the overlying splints.  Then, run the ends of the thread downwards until they reach the heel of the foot, and with them tighten the other ends of the splints as well.
So that the bandage does not shift from its place, then leave the bandage on as long as there is no pain, swelling, or inflammation to the limb. If anything of this sort occurs, promptly remove it, and correct whatever has happened, as we have described repeatedly.
If there is a splintered piece of bone piercing the flesh, then it should be smoothed, if possible. Otherwise, cut open the flesh, remove the splinter, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals.  Sometimes this thigh fracture can be bandaged without including the leg.
As we mentioned regarding the upper arm and forearm, except that this kind of reduction does not cause lameness to the patient.  However, if the bone is reduced without the leg being included, the patient will always be lame.
Know that the thigh takes 50 days or a little more or a little less to heal, depending on the variation in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On fractures of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but is often bruised.  If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a fragmentation of its parts, and this can occur with or without a wound.
Diagnosis is made through observation, and the fracture is treated by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they come together and unite, as best as alignment, gentleness, and precision allow. Then a circular bandage or splint is applied, if needed.
And further binding is applied above that which corresponds to the injury, then all cases described for other fractures, such as inflammatory swelling, and the like, should be treated in the same manner, addressing each symptom appropriately until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On setting a fractured shin.
The shin has two bones; one is thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its setting is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is twisted in all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg twists forward. If the thicker bone is fractured, and this occurs from the bottom, it is clear to you.
Therefore, use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly, just as in other cases, but if the fracture of the shin is extensive and has many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and take care in setting it.
There is an additional procedure for the leg compared to the arm.  After aligning the splints and completing all your work, take two pieces of pinewood, similar to those used for smoothing the walls of rooms (or possibly strips of palm leaves, or something similar),
Select pieces of moderate thickness, not too thin, and of length equal to the leg from the knee downwards.  Then wrap each piece with two layers of cloth lengthwise. Place one along one side of the leg and the other along the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two pieces in three places, at the ends and the middle.  With this restraint, the leg will not tilt right or left, and will be properly supported. A groove of wood may be used along the leg.
Place it [the groove/restraint] to prevent movement, especially in fractures accompanied by a wound.  Then examine the leg daily, carefully watching for swelling, puffiness, or any other abnormality. If any of these occur, treat them as necessary until recovery.  The leg bone will heal within thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the leg and fingers.
The heel bone is rarely fractured.  The leg bones may be fractured, and the fingers are rarely fractured, but are more commonly bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see those bones overlapping, have the patient stand upright on the ground, then place your foot on the protruding bones and press them down and straighten them.
Until they return to their proper positions. Then, take the bandage and splint, placing a small, flat board with two ends under the sole of the foot.  Securely bind the foot with the cloth and other necessary materials.
After three or four days, release the bandage. You will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as described.  If some of the fingers are fractured, manipulate and align them as described for the fingers of the hand.
Then, make a splint for the fractured finger, extending the length of the finger and slightly wider than it.  Place the board, as previously described, beneath the foot, and bind it securely. If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Make a splint for each finger, sized accordingly and wrapped in soft cloth. Secure the board beneath the foot, ensuring each end of the board extends beyond the sole of the foot for good support.
You should not forget to consider all the aforementioned symptoms in other fractures, and address each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the fracture of the female pubic bone and the male pubis.
When the female perineum is fractured, have her sit in a squat position, then slowly lean her back, holding her from behind.  Then, the midwife should fill the vagina with cotton until it is full and round like a ball.
Then, the woman should rock, raising her pelvis slightly, and the cotton will be expelled, so that a ball forms at the entrance of the vagina, and the bone fracture will be reduced.  Then, place a support under her back.  When she wishes to urinate, gently remove the cotton so that she can urinate.
And return it to the position it was initially placed, then return to her original support.  Do this for seven days or thereabouts and it will be healed. If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube of reed to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube forcefully to inflate the bladder within the vagina, and the fracture will be reduced. Then fill it with cotton and keep her as described until she is healed.  Likewise, if the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this method is used for its reduction.
And its application is the same as described for the hip bone.  The correct approach to these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is apparent to you, especially if you have some skill and understand this book. Indeed, the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
Follow the correct method for reducing and fixing it.  If a man's penis is fractured, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage made of cloth over it and bind it. Leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of bone fractures when accompanied by wounds.
If someone presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur, humerus, or similar, one should promptly perform bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting are favorable, as we have previously described.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately cauterize it with powdered alum, if nothing else is available.  Then proceed to set the fracture on that very day, and do not delay.
If no inflammatory swelling occurs, if inflammatory swelling does occur, postpone the reduction until the ninth day, so that the inflammatory swelling subsides.  Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it will expose you to undesirable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding and exposed, you should gently attempt to reduce and align it with your hands and a slight extension. If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument.  This instrument is made of iron, approximately seven or eight fingers long. And its width should match the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take three or four of these, as needed for treatment of each type of fracture.  They should be round and slightly thick, so as not to bend when pressed during use.
It should have a sharp tip, a bend at its end, thicker at the top and progressively thinner towards the bottom.  This is its image:.
It is called, in Greek, *permos*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent tip should be placed on the protruding bone end and pressed once.  If the bone has returned and is somewhat aligned, then finish by aligning the fractured ends against each other.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it properly, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it. If the bone cannot be repositioned as described, then cut it with a similar type of saw as we have previously mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, as best you can.  Then, remove any remaining roughness or thin flakes from the bone. If, after repositioning the bone, the patient experiences severe, painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can reposition it to its natural position, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once the bone is completely set, dip a cloth in a dark, astringent liquid, especially if it is summer, and do not place compresses or anything greasy on the wound.
So that putrefaction and decay will not occur.  Then, use splints once you have finished setting the bone.  Leave the wound uncovered, by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, sized to fit the wound.
Beware, most carefully, of tightening the wound with the fracture, as often the ignorant physicians do this, bringing their patients either death or sores or colds.  Let your tightening be gentle and relaxed, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some bad symptoms, as we have described, and if the patient experiences troublesome pain at the affected area, it is not appropriate to apply splints. Make bandages from strong cloths in place of the splints and secure them.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the liquid, and then use the dressings and ointments that we are accustomed to using for wounds, such as the four-part ointment, and similar ones.  You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that pus drains downwards easily.  If the wound takes many days to heal, and the pus does not stop, know that there are small fragments of bone.
Therefore, you should probe the wound with a probe.  Any fragments that have loosened, you should remove.  If any fragments are still stuck, and are irritating the limb and causing pain, make cuts to remove them in any way you can.
If the wound develops a cold, or decay, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, you should counteract each such symptom with a similar treatment as described in its section.
If a large, prominent bone like the femur or humerus, or similar large bone, is fractured and protruding from the limb, do not attempt to pull or remove it. Often death results from this.  Leave it until it decays; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place to treat it; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the suppuration that occurs after some fractures.
This suppuration often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially when it is near the joints.  It spoils the appearance of the limb and may prevent the limb from its normal function.
If the suppuration is fresh, use astringent medicines such as quince, frankincense, myrrh, gum arabic, acacia, and similar substances, taking some or all of them, and mixing them with an astringent liquid or egg white or vinegar.
Apply it to the suppuration with care and bind it tightly. Leave the binding on for many days, then remove it and repeat the application until the suppuration disappears, God willing, or apply a tight lead plate to it.
Lead has the property of removing all inflammation in the limbs. If the suppuration has hardened and become severe, and necessity requires its removal, cut through it from above, and cut or scrape away the excess until it is gone, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating a fracture, if the limb, after being set, remains thin and not in its original condition.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either the excessive loosening and binding of the ligaments improperly, or the excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and improper manipulation, or excessive movements at the wrong time, or insufficient and weak blood supply in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that the blood increases, using a bath, bringing joy and cheer, and similar measures.  Then apply asphalt to the limb to draw much nourishment to it, or continue to bathe it with lukewarm water. So that nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On the treatment of fractured bones that have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after the healing of a limb that has been set, the fractured bone shows crookedness or protrusion, or if it is misshapen, and the appearance of the limb is thus disfigured. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, one should not accept the claim of those who assert that the limb should be broken again from the head. Many ignorant physicians and setters have done this in our country.
This action is strongly censured, leading to great danger and, at its worst, crippling. However, if the crookedness and distortion are recent, it is necessary to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as the leaves, root, and crown of the flower, and the like, have been cooked.
And it is bandaged with relaxing dressings, such as carefully crafted diachylon, or the sap of the root of the flower is taken, mixed with chicken fat and sheikh fat, and bandaged with it, or plump figs are taken, pounded with pigeon dung, and similar remedies known as resolving inflammation.
And the distortion can be resolved through continuous gentle massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times. If the crookedness is old, severe, and hardened, and the need arises to treat it with iron.
Then, it is necessary to cut it from above, release the bone connection, and cut off the excess of the distortion or bone with gentle cuts.  Care and effort should be applied in this, and then the wound should be treated with what has been previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocated joint, preventing movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing severe pain and suffering to the patient.  Therefore, if a jaw dislocates, one must promptly attempt to relocate it.
Delay this not at all, for if delayed, swelling of the area, a swelling, will develop, making relocation of the jaw difficult.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor moved, nor stretched while it is swollen, since painful spasms and suffering often occur in the patient.
However, if this occurs, the patient should be bled, then allowed to rest until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, the affected area should be bathed in warm water and oiled.  The jaw should then be gently relocated, and each affected area treated as described in its appropriate section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as was done with fractures, from the upper body to the lower.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate; and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they slip slightly from their positions, relaxing a little; or they completely dislocate, relaxing entirely. To the chest, so that the patient's saliva drips and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stammers with speech.  But if the dislocation is slight, it will in most cases return to its place easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, one must quickly reposition it and delay nothing.  The patient's attendant should hold the head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or he should insert both thumbs, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides.  And with the rest of his fingers outside, he should align it.  He should order the patient to relax his jaw and allow it to move in any direction, while the physician aligns the jaw and pushes it back to its place.
If repositioning is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use warm water and ointment compresses until repositioning is easier.  Do not delay repositioning, as we said.  If they are returned to their place and the patient's mouth closes without relaxing, then place linen bandages with a resin and ointment mixture of rose-red wax on them.
Then tie gently with a loose bandage.  The patient should sleep on his back, with his head propped up between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left, nor try to chew anything.  Instead, his food should be soft and easily swallowed.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, let him eat whatever he desires.  He should use gentleness and not exert himself to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is healed and firm.
If the jaws, when dislocated at any time, do not return to their proper position, there is often fever and constant headache, and possibly the patient's stomach may become upset, and he may vomit repeatedly. If you see this, know that he is seriously ill.
Often, one who has this condition dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On relocating the collarbone and shoulder joint.
The collarbone does not usually dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outwards, which is discernible through palpation. To realign it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then, press firmly on the area with your hand; it will return to place.  After this, apply bandages and splints, securing them tightly.  The shoulder end, connected to the shoulder blade, rarely dislocates. If it does, it should be repositioned as described above, to the extent possible.
Then apply bandages, splints, and dressings, and instruct the patient to rest and remain still until healed.  Using the same treatment, the shoulder joint is repositioned if it, too, dislocates.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On repositioning the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is downward toward the armpit, the second toward the chest, and rarely upward toward the top of the shoulder.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade or in front of the nerve. It most often dislocates downward toward the armpit, especially in those with thin flesh, as it moves in and out quickly in them.
However, in those with thick flesh, it is the opposite; it moves out and in with difficulty. Sometimes, a person might experience a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and become hot.  One might suspect a dislocation, but it is necessary to examine this to ascertain the truth.
Then, in treatment, if the dislocation is downward towards the armpit, you will find an obvious difference between the dislocated shoulder and the healthy one.  You will find a protrusion at the head of the dislocated shoulder.  Under the armpit, upon palpation, the head of the dislocated shoulder will feel like an egg.
The injured person cannot raise their hand to their ear, nor move it in any way.  Similarly, if it dislocated toward the chest or upward, this will be evident upon palpation.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if the patient is young or the condition is recent.  To reduce it, have the attendant raise the patient's arm upward, then place your thumbs under their armpit and lift the joint firmly upward into place, while the attendant raises and extends the arm.
Then, gently lower it downward, and it will return quickly.  If it does not return with these methods, and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in warm water and use poultices that soften and relax tissues, such as cooked roots of the plant _line_, fenugreek, and King's crown in water.
Then, the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under their armpit.  The physician places their heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand, extending it downward.
The physician pushes the ball with their foot, and it will return to its proper place.  Alternatively, if you wish to reduce it in another way, have a person taller than the patient stand to the side, placing their shoulder under the patient's armpit and lifting it upward so that the patient hangs suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand down toward their stomach. If the patient is light, something else should be suspended from the hand to weigh it down, and the dislocation will return immediately.  There are also other methods of reduction.
Another method is to place a long, round wooden rod in the ground, similar to a mortar pestle but neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the top of the rod, and the patient, standing along the rod, has the rod placed under their armpit.
Then, the patient extends their hand downward on the other side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side. The joint will quickly return to its place. If reduction proves difficult with all the previously mentioned methods, then use this treatment: take a wooden rod about two cubits in length. Its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a rounded head, to easily enter the armpit in this manner.
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.  The rod is placed under the armpit, and the entire hand and arm are extended downwards along the rod.  The rod is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a support beam.  The hand is extended downward, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side. The joint will immediately enter its place. If it enters in any way possible, a moderate-sized ball of wool should then be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared dressing, made of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is applied over the entire shoulder area, rotating upwards.  The ball is tightly tied under the armpit. The bandage is tied over the dressing from above, and the hand is suspended from the neck.
He must not move his hand for seven days. The patient's food should be kept light so that the limb strengthens more quickly, and heals faster. Then, after seven or five days, he is allowed to exercise, and if the limb remains firm and does not relax, then he is healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three cauterizing materials should be used, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint does not remain stable,
If the bandage and tightening are repeated many times, and the joint still does not stabilize and falls loose, and the patient cannot raise the arm, know then that the nerve in the top of the shoulder has been severed, stretched, or relaxed.  Know then that the joint will never be stable in its position.
As for the dislocation of the jaw, which is near the chest and breast, and behind, it is to be repositioned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All other tightening and treatment should be used until it is healed. If, after healing, the limb shows sluggishness or delayed movement upon examination,
The patient should use hot baths frequently until that sluggishness loosens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
In the treatment of the dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is visible and palpable, regardless of the specific direction of dislocation.
If you align the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, this will be clearly evident from the concave appearance of the joint. The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be brought into contact with it.  You should act promptly and relocate the dislocation at once, before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, relocation becomes difficult and possibly the injury will never heal.  Especially if the dislocation is backward, it is the worst and most painful of all dislocations, and often results in death.
If it is possible to reduce the dislocation, the attendant should extend his arm fully with both hands, while the physician's hands are placed above and below the elbow. The physician pushes the joint back into place with all his thumbs or the base of his hands.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once so that the base of the hand strikes the shoulder, which is adjacent. If the dislocation does not return, use very strong, forceful extension, wherein two attendants extend the arm.
And the patient is held by two attendants as well, so that it does not move during the extension. Then the arm is turned in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around the hand. If the physician works on the joint with his hands, he should apply ointment to the joint to facilitate easy dislocation.
Then the joint is pushed forcefully until it returns. After its return, a bandage with a compress and a drying agent, along with egg white, should be applied firmly.  The arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is loosened. If the joint is firmly fixed in its place, loosen the bandage and leave it. If you see that the joint is not sufficiently strengthened, reapply the bandage and bandage and leave it for several days until it strengthens, then loosen it. If any swelling occurs after the joint has returned and been loosened.
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage, and kneading until it softens. Or, place a fatty ram's horn on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and a night. Then remove it and place him in a bath; when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then apply the horn a second and a third time with baths until it softens.  If you prefer, apply damp, finely ground cow dung with ghee, and bind it tightly. Repeat this multiple times; it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an assistant extend the arm. The physician should place his hand on the prominent part of the joint and push until it returns. However, one must look to see if the dislocation has moved to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the outside of their hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent on the outside of the hand, then the inside of the hand should be placed on the board so that the physician's hand is positioned over the same bony prominence. If it returns at that time, fine. Otherwise, bind it with a dressing that relieves inflammation.
Leave it be and do not repeat attempts, as it cannot be borne, nor can it be reduced after days have passed, other than the joint remaining crooked and causing the patient no harm, unless the hand becomes slack and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve has been severed or crushed, and there is no remedy except to bind it with cautery.  Sometimes this helps, sometimes it does not. After the wrist is reduced, apply the dressing we have described, then bind tightly and leave for five days.
Then it is released, and the hand is exercised. If its movement is difficult and some hardness appears, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction. If a finger dislocates towards the palm's surface or the back of the hand, straighten the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place, then bandage the finger's head and suspend it toward the direction it dislocated to.
Leave it for two days, then release it and straighten it until it stands upright that day.  If it is night, bandage it in the same way.  Continue to disband it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bandage it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Likewise, if it dislocates toward the back of the hand, bandage it towards the same direction and treat it in the same manner as before until it heals.  Do the same if it dislocates in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In treating the dislocation of the spine.
When a vertebra of the spine or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, because death quickly comes to the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool is expelled involuntarily; he cannot hold it.  Often, some of his limbs—either his legs, or his arms, or one of them—become relaxed.  However, if only one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often dislocates further.
Its displacement can occur in four directions. That which dislocates to the rear is called a hump.  There is no treatment for a hump that has occurred due to childhood illnesses.  As for a hump that has developed from a fall, a blow, or similar events...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, most of which are of little benefit.  I have summarized what is useful, shortening the extensive material they presented, clarifying the meaning, and providing a depiction of the instrument unlike what they described and explained.
I say that there is no remedy or cure for a hump that occurs in the front of the chest, nor for those that occur to the sides.  However, the one that occurs in the back, especially the kind I am describing, is treated by laying the patient on his face.
On a level platform near a wall, spread a moist mat beneath him to avoid injuring his chest. Then, place a vertical plank, planted in a hole in the ground, near his head at one end of the platform, and another plank near his feet at the other end of the platform.
A servant holds one plank, which is not secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other plank in the same manner.  Then, a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under his armpits. The end of the bandage is extended to the plank near his head and tied to it.
Then, another bandage is tightened above his hips, above his knees, and at his heels.  Then, all the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank near his feet.  Then, each servant pulls the plank towards their side with the bandage, and the planks remain in their embedded positions.
However, they are not secured, as we said. The physician places his hands on the hump with force to cause it to straighten, or he places a board on it and leans on the board with his legs until it straightens. If it does not straighten with this treatment, take a board about three cubits long.
A space is dug in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, to accommodate the end of the board.  The middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls firmly to press on the hump.
It returns to its place. If you wish to do it with a hand-spun device, you should dig into the ground near the head of the patient, at the end of the room, two planks each a cubit long, and at his feet at the end of the room as well, two planks of the same length.
Let there be a span between each plank.  A hole is made in each plank through which the winding device runs.  All the planks are firmly secured to the ground so as not to move at all.  A twisted stick, which is the winding device, is inserted, using the ropes tied in the holes of the planks.
At its end is a hole secured with a stick a span long, to wind around.  The other two planks have similar attachments.  Then, the ropes tied around the patient's chest are pulled tight on the winding device near his head, and the ropes tied around his legs are pulled tight on the winding device near his feet.
Then, a servant stands by each winding device, twisting the winding device with their hand. The physician straightens the hump as we previously described. This is a depiction of the winding device, the room, and the patient.
Then, after the spine is returned and the area is aligned, the dried dressing should be applied, with the egg white, then the linen.  Then place a splint made from a board, whose width is about three fingers, or similar, and its length should cover the area of the hump.
And on top of some sound beads. Then tie with the necessary rope.  The patient should use mild food until healed. If some lump remains in the area after healing, then the softening and relaxing medicines should be used, along with the splint we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used.  A lump may appear at the end of the spinal beads, leading to a mistaken diagnosis of dislocation.  This may be an extra bone protruding; do not treat it with this method, as death might result.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and subluxation that occurs in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards.  It dislocates inwards most frequently, and rarely forwards or backwards.  A sign of dislocation inwards is that if you place the patient's healthy leg alongside the affected one, it will appear longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend their leg at the groin.  The area adjacent to the groin will be swollen and noticeably prominent, indicating that the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of dislocation outwards are the opposite of these signs.  The sign of dislocation forwards is that the patient can fully extend their leg, but cannot bend it without pain, located in the knee. If they attempt to walk, they will not be able to do so forwards.
The patient will retain urine and their groin will be painful. When walking, their gait will be on their heels.  The sign of dislocation backwards is that the patient cannot straighten their knee or bend it before bending the groin, and their leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly visible near the hip area.  As for the reduction of these dislocations, observe if the dislocation has been long-standing and the patient has not attempted reduction, remaining in its condition.  If so, there is absolutely no cure.
Therefore, it should not be exposed to this.  As for a recent dislocation, of any of the four types, immediately manipulate the joint by extending it inward and outward, and move it to the right and left.  Perhaps...
If it returns without further treatment, then if it does not return thus, a strong assistant should be positioned to pull the leg from below, either with their hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another assistant pulls from above.
By inserting their hands under the armpits, then pulling with a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, another assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the pull is made either forward from the groin to the collarbone, or backward towards the back.
All of them should pull at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground and suspended.  This type of pulling is common to all four types.  If the dislocation returns in this way, otherwise, each type requires a specific treatment as described.
As for its specific return if the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their sound side, then a bandage is placed on the root of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then, the bandage is pulled upward from the groin towards the upper body, toward the collarbone.  A strong assistant then grasps the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls outward with great force, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other methods of returning this limb. If you are unsuccessful and this type of treatment is not effective, the patient's legs should be firmly bandaged with a soft bandage around both ankles and knees.
Each bandage should be about four fingers' width apart.  The affected leg should be extended further than the other by about two fingers' width.  Then, the patient is suspended from the head by a wooden beam within the house, with the beam a distance of two arms' length from the ground.
Then, a strong boy is instructed to grasp the head of the thigh, and another boy holds the patient, while the boy holding the thigh pushes with force.  The joint will quickly return to its proper place.  As for its specific return if the dislocation is outward...
The patient should lie on a raised platform, as described for the humpback patient.  A bandage is tightened around the affected leg and chest.  Then, one plank is placed at the patient's feet, another at their head, and a further plank is placed firmly in the middle of the platform.
Damp cloths are wrapped around the planks to prevent the patient from being harmed. The plank should be placed between the patient's thighs to prevent downward displacement during the stretching. Then, each attendant pulls in their direction, and the physician aligns the hip with his hands.  If it returns to its place...
Otherwise, place the board on him, pressing it as described for the humpback, except that the patient must lie on his healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg must be stretched in this same manner on the platform.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand.  The pressure should extend downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be stretched downwards.
He should be raised off the ground, but placed on a firm surface, and the hip should be positioned outward, as described when lying on the platform facing down, with the bandages tightened.
As we previously stated, the board should also be used to press the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint has returned correctly, a sign that it has returned is evident, and you will know by stretching the patient's legs.
If you see that the legs are even, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned properly.  Then, bring the thighs together, apply the dressing, and secure it with a bandage; ensure the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days.  Then, release the bandage and dressing, and compare the legs. If you find them equal in size, know that the joint has set. Allow the patient to walk.  If you notice any looseness,
Return and re-dress and secure it as you did originally. Leave it for three more days, and then release it.  Let the patient walk slowly over several days until the joint is strengthened, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of the knee joint.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not dislocate forward.  A sign of dislocation is to instruct the patient to pull the leg towards the thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated.  Treatment for all types of dislocation is for the patient to sit, extending their legs if able.  A servant sits behind him, holding his middle and gently bending it backward. Then, you sit on the patient's thighs.
Place your back against his face, put his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers on his knee.  Firmly press both sides of his knee with your hands, while another servant extends the leg until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh, gently, not forcibly. Then bandage it, attaching the leg to the thigh, and bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  Only light walking should be allowed for a few days, until strength returns.
If you cannot return it by the method described, then use forceful extension with the bandages previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be slightly displaced or completely dislocated.  Dislocation may occur inward or outward. A sign of dislocation is that the heel will appear swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating a simple displacement, it is easy to return it by gently pulling and aligning it until it returns.  If it is completely dislocated, the patient should be seated, and a strong assistant should hold him firmly behind the middle of his back.
Then you, with your right hand, grasp the foot from above and with your left hand from below, at the ankle.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice.  Then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Repeat this procedure as described, twice.  Then, on the third attempt, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the heel. If it returns in one or two repetitions of this procedure, and you find the foot aligned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure, as it will return.
If it does not return with the methods described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground, and insert a firmly secured wooden stake into the ground, positioned between his thighs.  A cloth has been wrapped around it to prevent injury to the patient, and the assistant secures the patient's thigh.
Then another assistant extends the leg, either by hand or with a strap tied around the patient's neck.  Each assistant pulls in the opposite direction, with the stake held firmly between the patient's thighs to prevent the body from pulling downwards during the extension.  Then the physician aligns the joint with his hands.
Another assistant holds the healthy leg downwards.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splints, and secure them tightly with straps.  Tie the foot to the splints downwards.  Care must be taken to avoid the nerve located behind the heel.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes him pain.  Leave it on for two or three days.  If the bandage loosens, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should avoid walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and become permanently damaged, and treatment will not be effective thereafter.  If a hot swelling appears, then the treatments for its reduction previously described in other parts of the book of medicine and healing should be employed until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of the joint of the toes.
Any dislocated parts should be gently straightened with a slight pull, without force. This is not difficult but rather easy. If the dislocation is in one of the joints of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or on a board while standing, like when walking. Then, place your foot on the protruding joint, and press down firmly on it with your foot until it returns to its proper place and no protuberance is visible.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, covering the entire foot, with two ends.  Secure it tightly for three days.  Then loosen it and keep the patient from walking for several days until it strengthens, and a recurrence is avoided, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both.
When something like this happens and you attempt to treat and set it, death frequently follows.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not rash or reckless.  Initially, one should use only medications that alleviate the acute inflammation, and leave the patient alone.
By God's will, except for what you hope will be safe from harm with the ease of the illness, and some hope appears to you in it, then return it to its original state immediately before the acute inflammation occurs.
If the limb returns to its desired state, use the treatment that alleviates inflammation and treat the wound with suitable desiccated ointments. If the dislocation is with a fracture and splinters have separated in the bone, then remove them. Follow in this what we have previously mentioned about simple illnesses in their respective places.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of risk, as previously instructed and advised. This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
