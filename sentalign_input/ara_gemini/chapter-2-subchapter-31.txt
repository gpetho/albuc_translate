Chapter thirty-one on the extraction of the roots of the molars and the removal of the jaw bones.
The broken one, if upon extraction of the tooth a root remains that has broken,
it is appropriate that you place on the area cotton with ghee for a day or two until the area softens.
Then you introduce into it the husk or the forceps whose tips resemble the mouth of the bird that is called the hoopoe.
And this is a picture of the forceps:
It will have been made like a file from the inside or like a rasp.
If it does not respond to you to come out with these hooks,
then it is necessary that you excavate at the origin
and expose all the flesh with the scalpel.
Then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, whose image is this:
Short at the end, slightly thick, and it should not be watered/polished, lest it break.
If the bone comes out with that, otherwise resort to these other instruments, whose image this is.
The first is triangular at the end, with some thickness in it.
Another nice triangular image/diagram:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, of which this also is its image:
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned previously in the filing of molars
And we may also use this instrument that resembles a large fishhook, which this is its image
Triangular, the curved end having some slight thickness so that it does not break, and it should be unpolished.
And know that the instruments for molars are numerous, and likewise the other instruments are almost innumerable, and the experienced and skilled craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves guide him to, because among diseases there are some for which the ancients did not mention instruments due to the difference in their types.
So if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then probe it in its place with what is suitable for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots, and we use a forceps, this is its form:
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone in place so it doesn't slip until the bone comes out.
And we treat the area with the appropriate medicines for that.
If the bone has some slight putrefaction, then scrape it from its putrefaction and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
