of cupping bleeds
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways:
either by lancing and drawing blood, or without lancing.
And this cupping without lancing is done in two ways:
either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by lancing and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, one of which is right on the top of the head;
and the other is in the middle of the neck;
and two others on the two sides of the neck;
and the cupping glass under the chin;
and the cupping glasses on the two shoulders;
and the cupping glasses on the buttocks;
and the cupping glasses in the middle of the two arms;
and the cupping glasses on the two legs;
and the cupping glasses on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are spread in the flesh, and therefore one does not weaken from it, as one does from bloodletting from a vein;
and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness that comes from plethora, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness cupping is required, or by habit, we administer it every time at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle, and at any time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; 
and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the nose helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the bleeding of the cephalic vein, and it is not appropriate for those of a cold complexion to use it, or those who have catarrh, because it causes them great harm; 
and therefore it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower for fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for cracking of the bronchial tube, and for coughs, and for congestion;
and there one should apply it lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it generates forgetfulness in the stomach and in the heart.
Cupping on the two sides of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for sore throat, and for pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to loosen his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for diseases of the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses that are in the mouth;
and is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and plethora.
Cupping on the elbows is worth as much as from the three veins of the arm, because it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the bleeder not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh, and has nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is placed on the buttocks is good for hemorrhoids of the anus, and for illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well; 
and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break;
and make large wounds there.
Cupping glasses on the legs bleed openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the spleen, and of the bladder, and restore menstruation;
and are placed at the location of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many ways.
The way to apply the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then cauterize, and replace the cupping glasses, and take care in the disposition of the bodies, because there are some who have tender flesh and clear pores:
so it is necessary to strike only once, and make wide wounds, and a little deep;
and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice:
the first time to thin the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, striking once is sufficient. 
And if we want a lot of blood, we start again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, you should anoint the places of the cupping glasses with opening and dissolving oil:
if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of cucurbita seed;
and if it is in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one being treated has tender flesh and large pores, no oil should be applied, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or cucurbita water, or purslane water, or similar.
And he who has much moisture, should rinse with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should rinse with old wine, or elderflower water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not be treated with cupping before the bath nor in the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and should not sleep after cupping, and must take care when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And be wary if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed;
then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things;
and eat chickens, and mutton, and moist foods.
And he who has a cold complexion should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and the day he is cupped, he should drink more than he eats;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to strengthen the principal members;
and the blood should be thinned, but it is not necessary for those who are hot to drink it.
The cups that are applied without scarification are those that are placed over the liver, and over the spleen, and for gout, and over the belly and the buttock and the loins and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate being cut over the skin, and it is only done to draw blood from one part to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we put cups on the belly and on the buttock to reduce the limb;
and removes the pain, when there is blockage or stone, thus removes by its attractive power perhaps the blockage, or loosens the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cups are applied empty to only suck;
and sometimes they are applied together with fire, and sometimes filled with lukewarm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cup with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.
The method of the cupping glass applied with fire is as follows:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, like for inserting a needle, and let it be made of brass, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a lit candle, and let there be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses for children are different from those for the elderly, and for the thin different from those for the fat.
And one should apply this cupping glass to the limb in this way:
take a wax candle or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cupping glass across the bar which is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be over the hole that we mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the wick as before, and repeats this often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then which is used in the case of pleurisy, acutely, there is no bar nor hole, and fire is used only when it is full of water, and it is placed only on the limb;
and this is the method:
