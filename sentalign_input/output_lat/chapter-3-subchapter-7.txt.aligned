On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	Â¶ On the restoration of a chest fracture.	0.8260492
The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted.	The chest is sometimes fractured in the middle, and this rarely occurs. Indeed, its ends are mostly fractured and crushed due to accidents.	0.86842835
The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	When its middle part fractures, which slopes downward, and severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and cough occur: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is visible in the broken bone, and it is not hidden from the senses. Its restoration is achieved by having the patient lie on his back: and placing a cushion between his shoulder blades.	0.8201802
Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs on both sides with your hands: and smooth them in alignment, in every way possible and fitting, until the shape of the bone returns to what is required.	0.76280266
Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	Then place a plaster and wool over it, and place a splint from a thin board of willow, or poplar, and others similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth. Then carefully bind it over the broken bone, so it does not move: and take the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it with appropriate compression.	0.86366665
If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment.	Then inspect the binding every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if there is a need to loosen it due to itching, or erosion at the site, or pain, or swelling, then quickly loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the appropriate treatment.	0.66164315
Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	Then replace the plaster, if you see it necessary: and attach the compression until it heals.	0.75199854
