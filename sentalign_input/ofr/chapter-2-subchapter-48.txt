of abscesses of the armpits
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then that contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b. down to line g.:
And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, then fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, then cut it as we have said in the cutting of scrofula, and if the wound produces pus, then administer a cautery as we have said before.
