When the boil bursts out
If the appearance of the swelling comes from the cautery of a wound or from the split of the sac, and it is on the belly and some pus comes out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries as mentioned before, or from windiness;
and if it is from the rupture of the sac and the exit of the intestine, the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body, and it is an easy thing without pain, and it appears in various forms.
And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when pressed with fingers, it recedes, and then returns, and perhaps it is squeezed, and grows a lot when entering the bath and from hard work.
And if it is from moisture, it is an easy thing, and it is clear when you press it with your hand, and it does not contract; and if it is from blood, the signs show a large and hard abscess, and it is fixed in one place;
and if it is from windiness, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you see if the appearance is from the blood of the artery, or the vein, or windiness.
So you must leave the treatment. Because there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, for the artery and for the vein.
And if the appearance is from the intestine or the bowel, you must order the patient to hold their breath, and lie straight, then mark around the swelling;
then command him to lie often in your hands,
then go around the place you have marked with the spatula,
then extend half of the abscess above with the large hook;
then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and the knot of the tie should be firm;
then open the half of the abscess stretched over the tie, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine;
if you find it caught by the tie, then untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or the vein hinders you, then go carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put in them two strong threads, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you had pierced;
then tighten the abscess in four places on the needles, and if you want, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself;
or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten, then treat it with what is needed, and finish the abscess as we have said;
and extract the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is needed, and seal the place.
