On the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Chapter XVI.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but it often suffers abrasion.
If indeed a fracture occurs, then it is nothing other than a crack or hole in its parts.
And it is either with a wound or without a wound.
And it is all felt with sensitivity.
And its restoration is such that the parts which are disrupted are aligned with the fingers, until they are joined and connected as evenly and easily as possible.
Then place a plaster made from sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; place a round splint over it if needed, and bind it with a bandage suitable for it.
Then consider all the instructions we have described for the other fractures, like the hot swelling and similar; thus, treat each occurrence with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
