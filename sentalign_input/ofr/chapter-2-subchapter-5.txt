of eye rheum
When someone experiences acute, recurring catarrh, and you see their eyes dim and small, and their vision weakening, and their eyelids burned;
and the hair falls out, and there is a sharp pain deep in the head, and the patient sneezes;
then know by these symptoms that these matters and this catarrh come from many veins, and the best treatment there is, is this one.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one the width of a thumb.
And begin from the incision at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone;
and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two edges of the incision and put in old cotton and linen tents;
then tie over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying agents, which promote the growth of flesh.
In this manner:
take two parts wheat flour, and four parts colophony, and make a plaster;
and apply it to these wounds to generate flesh everywhere.
