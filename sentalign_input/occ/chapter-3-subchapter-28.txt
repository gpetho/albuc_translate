Chapter XXVIII
On the treatment of wrist dislocation, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike other joints, but it is important to reduce it quickly before it becomes an inflamed abscess.
The reduction is done by placing the patient’s wrist on a table, with an assistant extending the hand, while the doctor presses on the joint prominence with his hand or palm, pushing until it returns to its place.
However, if the palm is already facing the forearm, the patient should place the back of the hand on the table for extension and reduction; if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, the hand should be positioned palm down on the table so the doctor’s hand can press on the joint prominence.
If it returns quickly, it is good; if not, then apply a poultice to prevent abscess and leave it; do not repeat this, as it may not endure further reduction attempts.
But if the joint remains twisted, it does not harm the patient except the hand becomes weak and cannot grip; then know the nerves are cut or bruised, and the only remedy is cauterization near the injury, which may help somewhat.
Once the wrist is returned, apply the poultice as recommended, leave it and bandage it for five days; then remove the bandage and exercise the hand.
But if movement is restricted and heaviness occurs, relieve it with warm water and gentle rubbing several times until it is alleviated.
