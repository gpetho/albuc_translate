of the abscess of the testicles
Know that in the cutting of this branch there is fear in many situations, for which reason it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone; and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is for many reasons.
That is to say, by an excess of sour and sharp [humor], which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow; and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and there is no pain, and it is a serious abscess; and sometimes an abscess is serious, dangerous and stony, and of a dark color, and sometimes it comes during the night from an artery, or from a swelling of a vein. 
When it is from a night artery, it is known by the condition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.
The one that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its condition upon pressing it with the fingers, and one can safely make an incision on this type, and on other flesh; and you must cut the heart of the testicles, then stretch the testicle upwards, and draw it out from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligament on all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already attached to this new flesh, then you must draw out the testicle and cut it; and if there is air in the tunic, or in what is inside the vessels, then you must free all that tissue, and cut it roundly.
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back part, then you must cut it all out and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
