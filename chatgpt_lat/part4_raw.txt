¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.  
On the treatment of abscess of the two tonsils.

Caput XXXVI.  
Chapter 36.

Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.  
Sometimes swellings occur between the throat, that is, the glands, which resemble almonds, which happen externally: and they are called the two tonsils: when you treat them with what we mentioned in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.

Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.  
If, therefore, the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.

Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.  
And if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, rather leave it until it matures.

Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.  
And then you will either pierce it, or it will rupture on its own.

Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.  
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.

Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.  
And the procedure for it is, that you consider before the operation, if its abscess has quietly completed its warm inflammation, or if it has decreased to a certain extent: then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should rest in your lap: open his mouth, and let an assistant hold it between his hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, which has this shape.

Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.  
Let it be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a small knife.

Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.  
Then, when you press the tongue down with it, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, without pulling with it any of the membranes.

Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.  
Then cut it with an instrument, which has the following shape.

Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.  
It resembles scissors: however, the ends of it should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly sharp towards the other: take care that it is made of Indian steel, or imbued with alfuled.

Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.  
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatumil, which has this shape.

Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.  
It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.

Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.  
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same kind of incision.

Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.  
Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.

Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.  
If, however, there occurs a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood stops: then treat it until it heals.

Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.  
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.

Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.  
Therefore cut them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.

Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.  
And I indeed once treated a woman with an abscess, which had arisen between her throat, which had taken on a dark color, with little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed with difficulty through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached the point of death, if she had remained one or two more days.

Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.  
And the abscess had grown so much that it had sent out two branches, which extended over the two nostrils.

Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.  
So I hurried quickly, and fixed a hook into one of them.

Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.  
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it.

Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.  
Then I cut it off, where it extended from the nasal cavity.

Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.  
Then I did the same for the one that extended from the other nostril.

Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.  
Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue: and then I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed: the woman’s throat was thus freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took some food.

Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.  
Therefore, I did not cease cutting from that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess kept returning in the place where I had incised it, until it became very extended with her.

Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.  
So I took a risk, and cauterized the abscess within the throat.

Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.  
Then it ceased to increase: then I departed, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
