of the crooked limb after healing When the limb is crooked after restoration, and the bone is visibly broken, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:	On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning. When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.	0.69421923
so do not believe the fools who say that the limb must be broken all over again, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;	In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this.	0.44532079
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and possibly death;	The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.	0.62018156
however, if the knots and distortions are fresh, they should be bathed with hot water, in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things;	But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon.	0.7309449
and make a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon, and take marshmallow mucilage, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;	Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied.	0.64169586
or take ripe figs, and crush them with dove droppings, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.	Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.76560783
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And movement should be applied to the limb every hour.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.6621605
And if the crookedness is old and hardened, like stone, and it is necessary to remove it with an instrument, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a thin scalpel, gently; and put care and study into the treatment.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.	0.6823329
