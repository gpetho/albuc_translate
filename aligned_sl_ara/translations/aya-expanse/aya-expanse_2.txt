The author of this book, having completed for you, O sons, this book which is the entire science of medicine in its completeness, and having reached the peak of its clarity and expression, has seen fit to complete it for you with this article, which is a part of the manual work.
Because manual work is its excellence in our country and at our time, it is entirely absent, so much so that the study of its science has nearly ceased and its traces have disappeared. Only a few traces of it remain in the works of the early scholars, which have been altered by hand and whose reality is filled with errors and confusion, making its meanings obscure and its benefits distant.
I have therefore decided to revive it and compile this article, explaining, elucidating, and condensing, and presenting images of knives and other tools used in manual work, as this is an addition to the explanation and a means to convey what is needed with clarity and precision.
The reason there is no skilled manual worker in our time is that the practice of medicine is a lengthy endeavor, and one must first master the science of anatomy as described by Galen. So as to understand the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, separations, and knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, origins, arteries, tendons, and static and mobile vessels, and their locations.
Therefore, Albucasis said that many are called physicians but few truly are, especially in the art of hand surgery, of which we have mentioned some in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable of what we have mentioned regarding anatomy is liable to make errors that may kill people, as I have often seen many who pretended to this science without knowledge or understanding.
I have seen a physician, ignorant of anatomy, who incised a cyst on a woman's neck and damaged some neck arteries, causing the patient to bleed to death in his hands.
I have also seen another physician, who advanced to remove a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the urethra; as the stone was large, he panicked and removed it using part of the urinary bladder. The man died around three days later; I had been called to remove the stone, and upon seeing the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, this is what I estimated.
I have also seen another physician who, for a living, practiced medicine with some of our country's leaders.
I witnessed a doctor, in his ignorance, treating a young black man with a fracture near the ankle, along with a wound. The physician, without knowledge, tightly secured the fracture using ropes and casts, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his desires, and left him for several days, commanding him not to loosen the bandage until his leg and foot had swelled, and he was on the verge of death.
Then I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage, so he found rest and recovered from his pains; yet the corruption had taken hold in the member, and I could not stop its progress.
The corruption continued to spread in the member until he died.
I also saw another physician who treated a malignant tumor; it developed an ulcer after several days, and the condition of the patient grew worse. This is because, if cancer is pure black humoral, it should not be treated with iron at all.
Unless it is in a member where the whole of it can be surgically removed.
For this, my son, you must know that manual work divides into two parts: the work that brings safety and the work that causes harm in most cases.
I have warned everywhere in this book about the work that involves risk and fear; you must be cautious and avoid it.
So that the ignorant do not find a way to speak or argue, take hold of yourselves with discipline and caution, and of your patients with gentleness and stability.
And employ the best path leading to safety and a favorable outcome, avoiding dangerous and difficult diseases.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may cast doubt upon your religion and world, for it is the stay of your honor and the elevation in both this world and the hereafter of your destinies.
As Galen said in one of his precepts: 'Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become bad doctors.'
This article is divided into three doors.
First Door.
In this door, we discuss the use of fire and sharp drugs, arranged from the ancient to the modern, with illustrations of the tools and instruments used for cauterization, and all that is needed for handwork.
Second Door.
In incisions, abscesses, phlebotomies, cupping, surgery, extraction of arrows, and similar procedures, all are categorised and arranged with illustrations of instruments.
**Chapter III**
In fractures, dislocations, treatment of internal injuries, and similar cases, all are categorised and arranged from the most recent to ancient times with illustrations of instruments.
**Chapter I**
**On burning**
Before discussing the procedure, it is necessary to mention the benefits and risks, and the temperament for which it is indicated.
I say that discussing the benefits and risks of burning is a lengthy and precise matter, a hidden secret, and many wise men have spoken about it.
They have differing opinions on this matter, and I have summarized their brief statements to avoid excessive elaboration.
I say that burning is beneficial in general for any bad temperament, whether with or without a material cause, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without a material cause and the dry temperament without a material cause.
On the dry humours with matter, there is disagreement. Some say cauterization is beneficial, while others disagree, stating that cauterization is not suitable for a condition marked by heat and dryness, as fire's nature is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy, and those who disagree argue that fire cauterization may be beneficial for a hot and dry condition in the human body. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the fire's humour, it makes the human body cold.
And I adhere to his saying, for experience has revealed this to me numerous times; however, one should not envision this unless they have been thoroughly trained and schooled in the art of cauterization. And he understood the diversity of human humours, the conditions of diseases within themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other humours, there is no cause for concern, especially for cold and wet conditions. All physicians agree on this, and they are unanimous in their opinion that cauterization is beneficial for these conditions.
Know, my sons, that the secret of treating with fire and its superiority to other cauterizing agents lies in fire's single essence; it only affects the member that is cauterized, without harming another connected part, except slightly.
The use of cauterizing drugs may extend their effect beyond the affected member and potentially cause a condition in the organ difficult to treat or even death. Fire, for its honor and noble essence, does so only when excessively applied.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the long service and care in the practice and observation of the realities of the matter.
For this reason, I have avoided lengthy speech, and if it were not unbecoming of this book, I would have presented you with a secret mysterious fire and the manner of its action upon bodies, expelling diseases through philosophical and logical discourse that would be profound for your understanding.
Know, O my sons, that there is disagreement regarding the time most suitable for cauterization, and they have designated the season of spring as the best time.
I say that cauterization may be appropriate at any time, for the harm caused by time passes into the benefit gained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is from essential, strong, and urgent pains that cannot tolerate delay, for fear of what follows them, a greater harm than what has already passed from the time.
Do not be misled, my sons, by what the general public and ignorant physicians imagine: the burning (cauterization) that heals from a certain illness will never return, and they make it into a permanent condition.
It is not as they thought, for cauterization is not like a medicine that alters the humor and dries up moistures that cause pain.
Cauterization, however, is superior to medicine in terms of its rapid success, strength of effect, and intense authority.
The illness may return at some point in time, depending on the patient's humor, the strength and severity of their condition, and what gatherings of impurities occur within their body, as well as their neglect of themselves through improper diet and other causes.
Except for the illness that requires cauterization, which is a gentle illness in a body part with few impurities and moistures. Such as the cauterization of a tooth for pain, it may not return, and this could be the least.
And the statement of the general public that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is correct in its opposite, for they believe that no treatment with medicine or otherwise can be effective after cauterization has taken place.
And indeed, the cauterization is the ultimate of medicine; for when we employ various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we resort to the last remedy, cauterization, which if successful, becomes the ultimate of medicine. Not as the common understanding or the ignorance of many laypeople and untrained doctors goes.
The ancients mentioned that gold cauterization is better than iron cauterization, as they stated, for the moderation and nobility of its essence. They said it does not cause an infection at the site of application, far from that.
For I have tried it and found that it acts differently on different bodies; cauterization with gold is better and more preferable than iron, as they said, except that if you heat the iron in the fire, its redness does not indicate the exact temperature you desire.
Since it cools down quickly, and if you increase its heat during fever, it melts in the fire and becomes clumpy, leaving the practitioner in a state of distraction. That is why cauterization with iron has become for us faster and more suitable to the task, God willing.
I have organized this chapter on cauterization into sections, from head to toe, so that the student can easily access what they need, God willing.
Chapter One.
The operation on the head is one whole procedure.
This procedure is effective against the humidity and cold that affect the brain, causing headaches, frequent discharge from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain. In general, it is useful for any condition that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, seizures, aphasia, and other similar ailments.
The procedure involves first ordering the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative that is gentle on the head, for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habit.
Then, he is commanded to shave his head with a razor, and place himself between your hands, seated and with his hands on his chest.
Then, you place the palm of your hand on the bridge of his nose between his eyes, and where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then, hold the oil-infused iron (as illustrated).
If the bone exposes itself to the extent of a tooth's head or a grain of coriander, raise your hand. Otherwise, if it cools, apply the same iron or another one. Until you see what was mentioned to you from the bone, take some salt and dissolve it in water, then dip a cotton in it and place it on the wound, leaving it for three days.
Then, take a cotton dipped in butter and leave it on until the inflammation from the fire subsides. Then treat it with four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that the wound, the longer it remains open, the more pus it produces, which is better and more beneficial.
Some mention that the skin should be burned to the bone, holding the iron until some of the bone's thickness is burned, then removing what has burnt and treating it afterwards.
Others say that the burning should be excessive, affecting the bone strongly until it falls out like amber or a small seed, and they claim that it releases vapors from the head in that area, leaving the wound open for a long time.
Then, it should be treated until it heals. I do not, however, ever use these types of burns on any but the most necessary occasions, and I consider it better to leave it alone if it does not cause immediate harm, for when the connection between parts is broken, as we have seen in other members, the head weakens.
Above all, when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cauterization is safest and best for me, and it is this that I employ, with God's will, to achieve security.
Chapter II.
Regarding the head as well.
If chronic pain occurs in the head and persists for a long time, and treatments such as poultices, applications, plasters, and bandages are used without effect, especially if the same cauterization described has been applied without success, then consider the following. If the patient's head is strong in structure by nature and does not feel weak, and it experiences severe cold, apply another cauterization slightly above the previous one. Then apply cauterization to each of the head's horns until the skin thins and reveals the desired amount of bone, as described. Apply cauterization in the back of the head, at the location known as the occipital region, and be gentle with your hand in this area, as the patient will experience severe pain distinct from the discomfort of all other head cauterizations, which I will describe in its appropriate section.
The iron used to treat the horns of the head, both front and back, should be gentler than the iron used for the middle of the head. And this is its image.
Chapter III.
In the treatment of a non-chronic fracture.
If a fracture of the head causes pain, with a headache that radiates to the eye, and the patient vomits, then the treatment should begin with purifying drugs for the head, followed by all other treatments mentioned in the classifications of diseases. If this does not work, there are two methods of application of heat (or 'kāi') in this case. Either with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
As for the application of heat with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it and cut off both ends. Then, using a wide scalpel, make an incision in the affected area on the temple, creating a pocket beneath the skin that will accommodate the garlic clove.
It should be inserted beneath the skin until it disappears, then secured tightly with bandages and left for approximately fifteen hours. After that, remove the garlic and leave the wound to heal for two or three days before dressing it.
On it, apply a cotton ball soaked in lard to the affected area until it suppures, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you prefer, you can do this with some burning drugs as mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning drugs.
And as for burning with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the iron in the shape depicted here:
It is called the "nailed iron" because its head resembles a nail with some ridges and a small protrusion in the center.
Then place it on the affected area and hold your hand while slowly rotating the iron; burn until half of the thickness of the skin is charred. Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery below, which could cause bleeding. Then soak a cotton ball in salt water and apply it to the area; leave it for three days. Then apply the cotton ball soaked in lard, followed by ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you prefer, cauterize this wound with the sharp end of the iron and be careful not to cut the artery in this non-chronic wound.
Chapter Four.
In chronic hernias.
If the treatment for hernia, as described above and in the classifications of diseases, is ineffective, and you observe a condition that cannot be remedied by the initial caustic application or by fire burning, then... Then the surgical knife should be heated until it becomes white, after marking the affected area with a line of half a finger or similar length, and once in place, tighten your grip to sever the artery and reach towards the bone.
However, you must be cautious not to burn the jaw joint that moves during chewing, which would damage the muscle or nerve controlling it, leading to spasms.
And be wary, for if the artery is cut, blood will flow, and cutting it entails risks. Especially for those who do not know what they are doing, and for whom this is an untried path, it is best to cease their efforts.
The treatment for bleeding from an artery, as it occurs on its face or in any other part, will be mentioned in detail in this book, God willing. If you observe a condition that cannot be remedied by this caustic application, then...
And I observed that the sick body was amenable to a cauterization in the middle of the head as we described, and I treated the wound until it healed, God willing.
If you wish, you may use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on artery slaking with a two-bladed iron rod, for it is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter Five.
On the pain of the ears.
If a pain in the ear occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned in the divisions, but the pain persists, apply the iron rod, which is called the point, as illustrated here.
Then, after heating it, apply the iron rod around the ear (or both ears if the pain is in both) as it rotates. Move the cauterization (iron rod) slightly away from the origin of the ear after having marked the location with ink, and make the cautery about ten points in each ear or similar. Then treat the wounds until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In the strength of knowledge.
The strength that is treated with cautery is of the type that occurs from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
And one should avoid cautery of the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasms.
When treatment with irrigations, snuffing, and gargling does not take effect, the patient should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly lower on the cheek, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cautery from the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs only on the side that appears healthy.
The image of the cautery is to make a single cautery opposite the top corner of the ear, slightly below the temple, and another in the cheek, with a length equal to that of the index finger.
Lower your hand with the cautery to burn through half the thickness of the skin. This is an image of the iron, which is a type of knife as described previously, but slightly gentler. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then the site should be treated as mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter VII.
In the case of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and treated as mentioned does not improve, and there is no fever in the patient, apply four cups (as a treatment). Apply one cup on each side of his head, as mentioned, and one in the back of the head, following the previously described method.
The application of hot cups (mukai) should be as mentioned, and a cup can also be applied to the stomach opening, which is even better. Then, treat the site as previously described.
Chapter VIII.
On forgetfulness.
For one affected by phlegm, the patient should first be given warm drinks and grains that purify the brain.
Then he shaves all his head, and a poultice of mustard, as described in the article on poultices, is carried on his back, applying it repeatedly; for this is a form of cauterization.
Do the same as described there, and if he recovers, otherwise apply three cauterizations on his head, aligned from the top to the bottom of the neck.
Make a space between each cauterization, as thick as a finger, then treat the cautery with what has been mentioned previously. If you wish to increase it and the patient can tolerate it, apply another cautery in the middle.
If you wish to increase it, apply another cautery on the horns (of the head), then treat it until he recovers; and the iron should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
Chapter IX
For treating paralysis and relaxing the whole body.
One should begin by purifying the head with cauterization and what has been mentioned, then shave the patient's head, apply a cautery in the middle of the head, a cautery on each horn (of the head), and a cautery on its back.
Three on the vertebrae of the neck, if you need for the purpose of relaxing the body to more than that and the patient is able to withstand it and the disease is strong and persistent, make four burns on the vertebrae of his back. And continue with the burning until most of the skin is burned off and then raise your hand and treat it as mentioned earlier, so that it heals, God willing. The cauterizing iron should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On seizures.
Only the seizure victim whose seizure is caused by phlegm should be cauterized, after first purifying his brain with powerful purgatives and other treatments mentioned in the sections, if the patient is old and able to endure medications.
But if he is a boy who cannot endure medications, then use gargles and brain-purifying chewing tablets for several days before, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head and cauterize a single burn in the middle of his head as mentioned earlier, and another burn at the back. And on each side of his head, make a burn. If the patient is strong and tolerable, remove the burns as mentioned for the person with paralysis, relaxing the body along the cervical vertebrae and the vertebral column. The iron should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
If the patient is a child, make the iron gentle in this manner.
Chapter XI.
On the treatment of melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrefied humours and thick phlegm, remove the burns as mentioned for the person with paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is a tendency towards black humours and the patient's body is filled with putrefied humours, then cleanse his brain as described in the previous division.
Then shave the patient's head. Make a compact cake from linen as round as a circle and place it in the middle of his head while he sits cross-legged. Take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a moderate fire until the finger can tolerate it when inserted. Empty it into the circle in the middle of his head and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week, along with all his other treatments, until he recovers, God willing.
If you wish to apply heat, do so with many small droplets without holding the iron with your hand, but rather through a gentle warmth. For this type of heat moderates the brain.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in butter or chicken fat on it.
Chapter Twelve.
In the treatment of water entering the eye.
If you notice the onset of water entering the eye, as described in the previous sections, act promptly to relieve the illness and protect the head from all moisture. Bathe the patient in a hot sweat bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave the patient's head and apply heat to it with a hot iron in the middle of the head, then apply two heats on the temples, if water enters both eyes, or one side if it is only from one eye.
Then cut all the veins and arteries beneath the skin with the iron, making incisions that are long and wide across the temples, taking care not to cause blood loss.
If you notice any of it, cut it off at the base with any means available, and we will discuss later the wisdom of binding and cutting arteries while preventing blood loss.
A severe burn may be made on the nape of the neck between the two bones.
Chapter XIII.
In the treatment of chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, resulting from veins and arteries located on the surface of the head outside the skull, and you have determined that this is due to a thick cold humour in the brain, then apply the cauterization described at the onset of the descending water. Cauterization in the middle of the head, two cauterizations on the temples, and two on the nape under the bones. If necessary, add a further cauterization on each side of the eye's tail at the edge of the eyebrow with a small iron.
Chapter XIV.
In the cauterization of the nasal cavity.
If the treatment as described in the previous section does not improve the condition, then promptly remove the ill person's coccyx for three nights, then shave his head and apply a cauterization to the central wound using an olive iron. Then apply the iron (maskar) twice above the eyebrows, slightly below the hairline, and be careful not to cut the artery, for this is the image of the maskar.
Chapter XV.
In the process of relaxing the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, apply a single iron (halali) to the eyelid with this iron.
And if you wish, apply them above the eyebrows a little, two irons on each side, distancing them from the temples, and each iron should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not exaggerate with the iron, but only apply it to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and this is the image of the iron.
Chapter XVI.
In the ironing of the eyelid.
If the eyelids turn inward, there are two types of ironing in this case. Either cauterization with fire or with a burning drug: if cauterizing with fire, the patient must first be instructed to let his beard grow, should he have one, until it is long and even.
If you trim it while it's still young, cover the patient's eyes with a bandage so they don't move until it grows and becomes even. Once it has grown and straightened, place the patient's head in your lap, then draw a mark on the eyelid with ink in the shape of an Asian maple leaf.
The mark should begin near the lashes, then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or poppy seed extract under the eyelid. Heat the iron to this temperature.
Then, apply the heated iron to the marked area in several thin passes until the skin surface is burned, forming a shape similar to an Asian maple leaf. A successful mark will be evident as the eyelid puckers and the hair on the eyelid stands up.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. After that, apply a cotton ball soaked in lard to remove the burnt skin, and treat the area with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair grows back after some time and the eyelid relaxes, repeat the process.
Repeat the cauterization on that area as you initially did. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, burn it away until it returns to its natural position, taking care not to affect the eye with the flame. For cauterization with a burning drug, instruct the patient to let their lashes grow until they are long and even.
Then make a paper from the bark of the mulberry tree, and take soap and slaked lime, each weighing the equivalent of a dirham, or similar, and grind them together thoroughly, doing so swiftly to prevent drying out. Then spread it out on the paper made from mulberry bark, placing it over one or both eyes, and place under the eye a cotton ball soaked in egg white, with the patient's head resting on your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine, press slightly, and move it as the patient feels the sting of the medication, for it will feel like fire. As long as they feel the sting, do not stop moving it. If the sensation subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Look, if you see the eyelid rising as it does when struck by fire or cut, then apply more of the medicine to the area that was not affected and did not turn black, until your work is complete. Then place a cotton ball greased with butter over the burned area until the sensation of burning disappears.
Then treat it with a palm butter ointment or similar, until it heals. When working, be extremely careful not to let any of the medicine fall into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after several days and there is any fear of hair entering the eye, it must be carefully cleaned.
Then prepare the medication for that area where the eyelid has relaxed, particularly as you did initially, and treat it until it heals, and this is a picture of the calamine leaf.
Be aware that people's eyes may differ in size and shape, so let your binding be appropriate to that, and the path to correctness is clear to whoever has experience in this craft.
Chapter XVII
On the treatment of the abscess that appears near the eye's socket.
If you treat the abscess as we described in the classifications of diseases and it does not respond to your treatment, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head on your lap, and have a servant hold his head between your hands, gripping it firmly but not moving it or striking it.
Then place a wet cotton ball in the white of an egg or in the saliva of a lizard on his eyes, and heat the iron in the following manner.
It should be hollow, shaped like a tube like the feather of an eagle, with one end for the heat and the other either perforated or solid, but it is best for your work if it is hollow on both ends.
Then, if the fistula is open, squeeze it and extract the purulent fluid and dry it. If it is not open, open it and extract the pus, then place the iron on it while it is still hot, and hold your hand firmly until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose to avoid any mistake or distress to the patient, so that the iron does not fall into the eye and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first application of heat, otherwise, reheat the iron if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If it does not heal after forty days, apply a sharp, corrosive medicine to expose the bone and strip it as mentioned in its respective section, God willing.
Another method for treating fistulas, mentioned by some of the earliest practitioners, involves making a small incision at the site of the fistula and inserting a thin cone-shaped object into the same opening. This is depicted below.
Pour into it an amount of melted lead weighing the equivalent of a dirham, while holding the cone firmly with your hand. The patient must not move at all to prevent the molten lead from entering their eye. It is recommended to place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
Lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it in a remarkable manner. If the fistula is healed through the use of heat and treatment as mentioned, otherwise there is no choice but to use the nose hole and return the fistula to its path in the nose as will be discussed in its specific place.
Chapter XVIII.
On burning the fissure of the lip.
A fissure often occurs in the lip, known as a 'hairline', especially in boys' lips. If treating this fissure with the methods mentioned above does not work, then take a small, sharp iron (as illustrated) and apply it to the affected area.
The cavity should be as thin as the knife blade, then place a wheel over it to protect (it) and insert it into the fissure until the heat reaches its depth. Then treat it with a poultice until it heals, God willing.
Chapter XIX.
On burning the fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears in the gum tissue, or on the soft palate, or at the base of the teeth, and dries up, bursts, and becomes a fistula producing pus, and treating it does not work, then you should heat an iron (tool) to fit inside the fistula.
Then, insert a protector into the fistula hole and hold your hand until the protected iron reaches the bottom and ends of it, and do this once or twice, then treat it as we mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the treatment stops and it heals, otherwise, there is a need to examine the place and remove the rotten bone as mentioned in its section, God willing.
Chapter XX
In the treatment of teeth and relaxed gums.
If the gums relax due to moisture, the teeth move, and treatment with medication is ineffective, place the patient's head in your lap, then apply the heated iron, as depicted below, after placing a tube on the tooth.
Insert the heated iron with a wheel protector, hold your hand slightly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the tooth's root, then raise your hand and repeat the process as desired, after which the patient should rinse their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out; the loose teeth will be firmly set, relaxed gums will tighten, and corrupt moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cases of toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or has a worm and does not respond to drug treatment, there are two options: either apply heat with sesame oil or use fire.
The method with sesame oil involves taking melted cow sesame oil, boiling it in a cast-iron pan or shell, then taking a cotton wick, wrapping it around one end of a rod, immersing it in the hot oil, and applying it to the aching tooth with a turning motion until it cools.
Then repeat this process multiple times until the heat from the fire reaches the root of the tooth. Alternatively, you can dip a woolen thread or cotton in cold sesame oil and apply it to the aching tooth, placing a heated iron on top to ensure the heat reaches the base of the tooth.
For the method using fire, take a copper or iron tube, slightly thickened to prevent the heat from reaching the patient's mouth, and apply a heated iron to the aching tooth, holding it until the iron cools, repeating this process multiple times.
The pain may disappear either that same day or the next. After applying the heat treatment, the patient should fill their mouth with sweet sesame oil, hold it for a while, and then spit it out. This is the image of the iron.
Burn with any side you choose, according to what is possible. This is the shape of the tube.
Chapter XXII.
On the pig's carcase.
If the pig's carcase is affected by phlegm and cold humours, and does not respond to medicinal treatments for maturation, then quickly roast the hollow iron rod, as illustrated here, on both sides.
Let the smoke escape from the other end when roasting; place it protected over the same tumour multiple times, as needed, until you reach the depth of the tumour. If the tumour is small, adjust the size of the iron rod accordingly.
Then, leave it for three days and apply a cotton ball soaked in lard to remove any remaining burnt areas. Treat the wound with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter XXIII.
On the roasting of those suffering from hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If moistures dominate the bronchial tubes, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxatives. Afterwards, roast the affected area with an iron rod placed at the throat's opening, near the base of the neck.
Beware that the cautery does not reach the pharynx, and burn only half of the skin, then apply another cautery at the joint of the neck on the last bead, powerful, and let the iron be nail-like in the manner previously described.
Then treat it as mentioned above until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Fourth.
On the cautery for lung disease and coughing.
If the coughing and lung disease are due to cold dampness, without fever or consumption, and the condition is chronic, apply two cauterizations above the shoulder blades in the lower, soft, hollow places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And let the iron be nail-like in the manner previously described. If you wish, it can be a puncturing cautery with the iron called the "dot," whose image was previously presented in puncturing ear pain, and the dots should be from thirty to similar in number.
Then treat it as mentioned above until it heals. You can make an iron with three prongs in this image, and the cautery should be done quickly because you cauterize three times at once using this iron. This is the image of the iron.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
On the Wrist.
If the head of the humerus becomes dislocated due to slippery humidities or does not adhere when returning it to its place, until it acquires that habit of returning, then it becomes displaced with the slightest movement as we have seen, in this case, the joint should be reduced first. Then the patient should lie on his back or on his right side, and raise the skin inside the armpit with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the iron with two handles as shown in this figure.
Then use it to heat the skin until it reaches the other side, and the shape of the burn will have four burns. It can also be burned with an iron having three handles, and in this case, the shape of the burn will have six burns, and the handles will be on the soft part of the wound.
And this is the figure of the iron with three handles.
It can also be increased by one, making the burns eight, then apply heated balls with salt and bind the patient to rest and do not move the limb for a while until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, this rarely happens.
A single cauterizing iron over the shoulder joint, or multiple small ones by dripping, will stiffen the joint, expel moisture, and heal the patient.
Chapter XXVI.
In the treatment of the stomach.
If in the stomach there is cold and excessive moisture, causing it to lose its balance, with frequent fluxes and after trying various treatments without success, the patient should lie on their back, extend their arms and legs, and receive three cauterizing irons. A cauterizing iron, the size of a finger, under the breastplate, and two more below each side of it, forming a triangular shape, with a distance between them to prevent overlap if it heals, and the depth of the burn should be one-third the thickness of the skin. The shape of the burns must be as described.
As per this image and measurement, without any excess.
And if preferred, one large cauterizing iron can be applied in the middle of the stomach as depicted here.
The iron used for this single burn, as shown, should be in the shape of a circle as depicted here.
The stomach may be cauterized with dots, if one is concerned about this cauterization. One marks points on the stomach with ink in the amount desired, then cauterizes it with a dotting iron, and subsequently treats it with the previously mentioned remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter XXVII
Cold cauterization of the liver.
If a pain in the liver is due to cold, dampness, or putrid wind that exceeds its natural disposition and is treated as described in the previous sections without improvement, then other remedies should be considered. The patient should lie on their back, and mark with ink three cauterizations in the shape and size described, directly below the ribs where the human elbow joint ends.
After each cauterization, apply pressure with a finger of the desired thickness. The iron should be held straight along the body and not pressed against the skin.
The amount of skin burned should be no more than half its thickness. If the patient is standing, their arms and legs should be extended; if lying down, they should raise their arms and legs. This is the image of the iron.
These burns can be treated with a hot iron, if you have skill and caution in the art, and take care not to overdo it, or else you may burn the entire skin, reaching the abdomen and intestines, for the skin there is thin. Be aware of this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In the case of a tumor in the liver, use heat.
If a pus sac appears in the liver, to determine whether the tumor is in the liver tissue or in its capsule, it will cause the patient a sense of weight and pain, but not sharp pain.
If it is in the liver capsule, there will be a severe sharp pain, and if the doctors have been unable to treat it, the patient should lie on their back, then mark the location of the tumor with ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire; this is an iron shaped like a crescent. This is its image. Apply a single burn with the hot iron, burning through all the skin and reaching the capsule to expel the pus. Then treat it as a wound until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by those who have been well-trained in the art of medicine and have repeatedly experienced these diseases through trial. If they proceed with such an act, it would be better to leave it alone.
Chapter XXIX
On cauterization with a hot iron.
The earliest mentions of cauterization with a hot iron describe the use of the roots of dried, long-stemmed rhubarb, taking one root that is longer than the thickness of a finger, immersing it in oil, and heating it over fire. Then, apply a single cauterization between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly below the jugulars, tilted towards the side under the beard. Also, apply two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
Apply two cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, tilted slightly backward, another in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach. Additionally, apply three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides below the ribcage, beneath the cauterization between the arms.
One should not deeply insert the cauterizing iron into the skin, but rather use it on the outer surface, as some of the earliest authors mention that people would use a flat iron-like tool, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reached the affected area.
And the condition will resolve, as we have mentioned, in the case of a liver tumor, and in this operation there is danger; either the patient dies immediately, or an incurable fistula develops at the site.
Chapter Thirty
On the Spleen.
If the treatment for the spleen, as mentioned in the previous section, is ineffective, there are three options, all of which are correct: either apply three or four burns in a row across the length of the spleen.
In the form of liver burns, which present as described, with each burn separated by a distance equal to or slightly greater than the thickness of a finger, and using the same technique mentioned for liver burns—neither too deep nor too shallow. The patient should be laid on their back for the procedure.
The other option is to perform the operation on the arm, raising the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left arm ends; the skin should be raised across the width of the body so that the burns fall along the length of the body.
Then, insert the forceps carefully so as to pass through the skin on the other side, and remove the forceps after passing through. The burns will be four in total, or you can use the other forceps with three prongs for the procedure.
Then treat the site of the burn after allowing it to discharge pus for many days, for this is more effective than all other treatments mentioned.
Chapter XXXI.
On the treatment of edema with burning.
Burn therapy is effective only in the case of edema caused by a discharge of pus, especially when all other treatments mentioned in the classification have been ineffective. One should apply four burns around the navel and one on the stomach.
Apply another burn to the liver, one to the spleen, and two behind the ribs, one facing the chest and another facing the stomach. The depth of the burn should be near the thickness of the skin, and then leave the burns open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not cease the patient's treatment after the burn, but continue with what is necessary to unite the two aspects, so that healing comes quickly. The shape of the burn on the back should be nail-like, as described earlier, and the one on the stomach should be olive-shaped.
Chapter XXXII.
On the Foot and Leg Deformities
If the toes and legs become swollen with yellow water, they should be cauterized on the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and the ring finger.
Hold the iron with your hand and do not bend it, then raise your hand without releasing it; for it is exuding the yellow water, and the iron should be held in this manner.
Then, apply the iron to the legs twice in each leg, using the sharp end of the iron. The first cauterization should be just below the knee, and the second one further down towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh, perform two cauterizations as well.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for some time, allowing the water to drain, and then treat it with all that has been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of diarrhea.
If diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the muscles and digestive organs of the stomach and intestines, and if various treatments are applied without improvement, and you observe that the patient is strong enough to endure it, then apply a large cauterization on his stomach. On this basis, the operation on the stomach involves using a circular iron and four burns around the navel, gently applying the delicate screw iron, and making one or two large burns to the cotton over the coccyx.
If you observe an abundance of moisture and the patient is susceptible to it, apply a burn to the groin and another to each side, and perhaps add two small burns near the large one on the stomach; this treatment is sure to be beneficial, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On burns for hemorrhoids.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids, numerous or single, of thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and if they have been treated as mentioned in the sections without success, then apply to the patient three burns below the tailbone, slightly under the table, in a triangular shape.
Apply a burn under the navel, approximately with two fingers, and if you consider that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digesting well, and you observe swelling in his face, then make a large burn on the stomach as mentioned before, and another burn on his liver. Apply another burn to his ribs using a screw iron, and leave the burn open for some time, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On warts.
After cutting it, if you cut off a wart, heat a iron similar to a mill, then insert it cauterizing in the same cut wart and press your hand until the iron reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cut off each one with a cauterization as we described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal; and if the cauterization is also large on cotton, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula that occurs in the seat (anal region) and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the fissure and treatment described in its place, or refuses it, he may heal with cauterization; if a fistula occurs that causes pus and corrupt humors to flow, first measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine the depth of its entrance with a probe, heat an iron similar to a mill, insert it cauterizing in the same fistula along the depth of the fistula and the distance the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization once or twice or three times, as needed, to burn all those corrupt tissues.
Beware of burning a nerve, if it exists, or a large vessel, if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestine.
Beware of these places, but only act upon them if the fistula is in a fatty area and you judge that it is not permeable. Then treat the site until it heals, for if the site closes up and no longer leaks and remains so for a period of time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if it no longer leaks, know that it is permeable or that there is a dead bone or something similar within it, as will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter XXVII.
On the kidney stone.
If a kidney stone causes pain due to cold or severe chills, and as a result the patient's strength is reduced, one should apply heat to both kidneys using the copper coin iron (as mentioned earlier) with a single application to each kidney. It is also possible to apply heat three times on the same table, resulting in three consecutive applications, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the Bladder Stone
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then make a incision below the navel on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and make incisions on both sides of the navel, one on the right and another on the left.
After the incisions on each side, make a burn of the size of a thumb joint, and if necessary, another burn lower down on the back, making sure the instrument used is a clamping forceps as mentioned above.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On the Uterine Curettage
If there is a buildup of cold and moist material in the uterus, preventing conception and damaging the menstrual flow, or causing pain during its passage, it should be treated with three burns around the navel, as mentioned in the bladder incision procedure. A burn should be made on cotton below the back or two burns, using a clamping forceps.
Chapter Forty
In this manner, dislocate the hip.
Misaligned moistures may cause the hip to dislocate, indicated by a leg appearing longer than the other when measured. If you find the site of dislocation as a gap, it is necessary to apply heat to the hip joint itself in the form of a semi-circular burn.
After marking the hip with ink so that it rotates and falls into the center of the circle, and the heat applied is as shown in the image (a caliper), if you do not have this caliper, make three heats with a large olive-shaped caliper.
Make the heat deep, according to the thickness of the skin, and treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
In the heat for sciatica.
If a pain occurs in the hip, caused by cold and moisture, and you have treated the patient as mentioned in the sections, but the treatment was unsuccessful, then the patient should ease the thick humors with putrid odor or aloe vera or similar substances.
Then, apply the cauterization on the face of the wound in two ways: either with burning drugs or with fire. The cauterization with fire is performed in several ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip itself with three triangular burns as shown here.
It should have a suitable depth, and between each burn, the distance should be equal to the thickness of a finger. The cauterizing iron should be olive-shaped. A single burn can be made in the center of the hip, which would be four burns in total. Alternatively, you can apply it in the form of a circle mentioned earlier for a single cauterization to dislocate the hip.
The circle should surround the entire hip and burn through all the thickness of the skin. This is the description of cauterization for sciatic nerve pain that is specific to the hip itself, without extending to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, apply two burns on the thigh at the spot indicated by the patient as painful, and a single burn above the ankle with four fingers towards the outer side, slightly. The cauterizing iron should be sword-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply cauterization at the indicated spot with a point iron three or four times or more if necessary. If the pain is below the knee and extends towards the leg, apply a single burn with a sword-shaped iron.
Be cautious in all incisions to ensure that you do not cut through a nerve or major artery, as this may cause severe harm or complications to the patient.
I have seen cases where individuals were incised above the ankle, and the cauterization was excessive, causing the leg to become gangrenous, extending to the foot, and eventually leading to the putrefaction of the entire limb, followed by diarrhea and death. In such cases, if the pain affects both sides, treat them in the same manner.
Some wise scholars have described a cauterization procedure for the hip, involving creating a cylinder of iron with a diameter of about half a span, and at its mouth, a thickness equal to a date pit or slightly less. Inside this cylinder, place another smaller cylinder, followed by a third one.
After arranging the cylinders with the specified spacing, leave them open on both sides, with a height of approximately one or two span, and attach a handle made of secure iron to the cylinders.
Then, heat them in the fire until they turn red and emit sparks. Place them on the hip of the patient, who should be lying on the healthy side. Apply three circular cauterizations at once, then leave it for three days, dressing it with butter and keeping the wound open for several days.
Many times, then treat it with a ointment until it heals. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and the fearsome appearance, and there are few in the desert who can bear it, except that it is effective cauterization for those who endure it and suffer from it.
And as for cauterization with burning drugs, it is to make two half-circular vessels into which the door of the firebox descends, made of copper or iron.
It has a height of about two fingers or similar, and it is open at the bottom and top, with some pieces held together in this manner.
Then lower them onto the right hip of the patient, who is lying on their healthy side, firmly gripping the hand. Pour water between the circles, cooled slightly over a small fire for about an hour, and the patient endures the stinging and burning sensation, finding it akin to fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water off the hip entirely with sweet water. Leave it for three days, applying butter to it until the burn's blackness disappears, and let it heal for some days; this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain spreads to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it to hold water in the same way as was done for the hip, as described in the article on preparing medicinal solutions.
Take from saltpetre and unquenched lime each a part, grind them, and put them in a new cauldron with a small hole at the bottom, large enough to admit the rod, and place under the base of the cauldron another cauldron sealed with clay.
Add to the saltpetre and lime water from fresh sources, immersing them with your finger after tightly gripping them together. Leave the cauldron until the strong water has drained to the bottom of the sealed cauldron, then gather all the water and pour it over fresh saltpetre and lime. Repeat this process.
It becomes then extremely sharp, useful in many medical procedures and for treating various members, as it acts like fire itself. Among the remedies are those that cauterize the hip, such as thyme, honey from plantain, and lime mixed with soap.
Galen relates a story of an ancient man who cured hip pain, sciatica, and bone inflammation with a remarkable treatment that he claimed was sufficient alone and effective from a single application.
Even so, he would sometimes immerse himself in a bath, carried in and out, having been cured. If green hellebore is not available, then dry hellebore may be used, finely ground and mixed with some fat, applied to the hip, or leg, or thigh where the pain resides.
Tighten and leave for three hours or until the patient feels the burning has subsided. Then, immerse them in a bath, and if their body is moist, place them in a tub. The pain will cease and heal with God's permission. If it does not heal, repeat the dressing after ten days.
It will heal, if God wills, and remember that no one should use fire with these remedies unless the body is first emptied. Diascorides mentions that goat's sweat, when applied as a cauterization, is beneficial for sciatica.
The cauterization should be performed as follows: take wool, soak it in aged oil, and apply it to the deep area between the thumb and the wrist, closer to the wrist. Then, use dried goat's sweat.
Then, ignite it with fire until it becomes a hot coal. Place this on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Take another one and repeat the process until sensation reaches the middle of the upper arm and the pain subsides, by God's permission. This type of cauterization is called 'ka'i al-ba‘ar.'
Chapter Forty-Two.
For the cauterization of back pain.
Pain in the back may result from numerous causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and similar conditions. It is due to the discharge of cold, wet matter, and the application of heat, which occurs only in this category.
When the pain results from the discharge of cold matter, after making the patient vomit, he should be treated with a hot compress on his back, where the pain is located in three rows across the width of the table. In each row, there should be five or more applications of heat, depending on the patient's condition and strength.
The heat should be applied using a point iron, and if desired, three or four applications can be made with a medium-sized hammer iron, as shown in this figure.
Chapter 37
In the treatment of a curvature, start with heat.
This condition often affects young children, and its initial sign is difficulty in breathing and movement. In the lower back, you can find a bone that has protruded, standing out from the rest of the vertebrae.
If you observe this, and wish to stop it, apply heat using an iron in a circular shape, as shown here. To apply the cauterization to each side of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, you can cauterize around the vertebra with a point iron in two or three rows, making the points close to each other, then treat the site until it heals as we mentioned.
And be careful not to use cauterization on the curvature that results from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four
On the cauterization of gout and joint pains.
If joint pains result from cold dampness that accumulates in a body part, and if the pains occur in the legs, doctors usually call it gout specifically.
If the cold gout is treated with the remedies we mentioned in the sections, and the pains do not subside, then cauterization can be used to alleviate them, by applying multiple cauterizations around the ankle joints after vomiting, using a medium-sized point iron like this.
If you need to apply drops to the face, use a point iron. If the pains spread to the knees or other joints, and this happens frequently, cauterize each knee with three or four burns from each side using this same olive-shaped point iron.
If more heat is required, use it but do not insert your hand deeply into the heat; rather, apply it to only the thickness of the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or back, employ the heat as mentioned in its section.
If the pains are only in the hands, make dots around the wrists as if you are forming two rows; if the pains persist in the fingers, make dots on each joint and on the palm, and if after a few days the pains ascend to the elbows or shoulders, proceed as mentioned for them.
Treat them from all sides. The patient should not lack proper treatment and medication; indeed, if he improves his diet, purges phlegm, and follows this heat, he will recover, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the heat for hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and fat descend to the testicles, and this is a recent onset, one should order the patient to abstain from food for the day and use laxatives to facilitate the passage of stool from the body.
Then, have him lie down on his back between your hands, and order him to hold himself until the fat or intestine protrudes. Then, with your finger, push it back, and with a pen, mark below the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a half-circle, whose ends point upwards towards the body.
Then, the iron of this shape is heated.
Until a white cloth is applied, which scatters sparks, then the intestines or entrails are returned to their cavity, and a servant places his hand over the area to prevent the intestines from protruding, having separated them between the sick person's legs, and a cushion is placed under him, and another servant ties his legs.
And another servant holds his hands, then the iron is lowered onto the same mark, and your hand with the iron stands straight up, holding it until it reaches the bone or returns it if it did not reach the first one to the bone.
Be careful not to allow the intestines to protrude while applying heat, otherwise you may burn them, leading to the patient's death or great harm; know that the iron should be applied gently for children according to their size and firmly for adults according to theirs.
Then, after three days, treat the area where the heat was applied with lard until the dryness caused by the fire disappears, then treat it with all kinds of ointments until healing occurs; the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the wound is completely healed.
During the course of treatment, you should ensure his diet softens his stomach to prevent the intestines from protruding during movement or defecation; then, after 40 days, if he wishes to stand up, use a tight bandage and keep it for another 40 days, reducing physical exertion, overindulgence in food and drink, and loud crying.
If this procedure is carried out in this way, it will heal completely, God willing. I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its own section, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is beginning to form, if you want to prevent it from increasing, cut a round cauterization around it according to its size. If you burn the skin, let it be two-thirds of its size, then treat it as we mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. Some of the ancients used to cauterize the hernia with a triangular iron in this manner.
After learning about the hernia with ink, make a line across the width on the upper side of the hernia and another line down below, then lower your hand and make one round cauterization with a nail-like iron; the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter sixty-four.
On the female cauterization.
If a pain occurs in any of the members due to a fall or blow and this pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medication, it should be cauterized with a point iron; each member should be cauterized according to its size, whether small or large, weak or strong.
If the pain and weakness overcome it, then if it heals from the first cauterization, otherwise repeat the cauterization, because these pains have a habit of moving from one part to what is near it, so follow them with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter LXXIV
On cauterization for leprosy.
As for lepers, cauterization can be of great benefit to them, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by putrefaction of mucus and blackness.
If you intend to cauterize, examine it; if leprosy is just beginning and you treat it as we mentioned in the classification, and it does not decrease or stop, and there is a fear that the patient will be affected by corruption of all his humors, then make five cauterizations on the head. One at the center of the head, as is usual, and another below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the horns (of the skull), and one from behind on the spin of the nape; and press your cauterization instrument slightly so that it affects the bone a little.
Scars will peel off, making it easier for the dense vapors to escape; also cauterize it with another cauterization on the same spleen as mentioned before. If leprosy continues to affect the patient and becomes evident, then these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head should be repeated. Treatment of Various Parts of the Body with Burns: One burn on the tip of the nose, two burns on the cheeks, two burns on the neck vertebrae, six burns on the back vertebrae, one large burn on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it on the same table, and two burns on the hips, one on each hip. Two burns on the knees, one on each knee; two burns on the elbows; two burns on the shoulders; two burns on the chest joints; a burn on every joint of his hands and feet; a burn on each heel of his feet; and a burn on each forearm.
Be cautious of the nerve behind the heels to avoid burning them; a burn may be applied to the pubic bone, the stomach opening, and the liver. Know that the more burns you apply, the more effective and beneficial it will be.
Know that the patient does not feel the burns as painfully as a healthy person, because their body is numbed; the size and intensity of the burns should be adjusted according to the member and joint, as previously described in the characteristics of cauterization.
Then treat the burns with a mixture of fine nard and honey, along with other remedies, until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In the case of numbness, when a part of the body is numbed and treated with drugs, ointments, and dressings without healing, then cut off the numb member according to what is appropriate for the severity or lightness of the member. Let the incision be deep enough to slightly thicken the skin.
Then treat it with an ointment until it heals, and it may be cut for some numbness that occurs in the hand or foot at the vertebrae where the nerve exits that moves that member, thereby eliminating the numbness.
Only one who is well-versed in the anatomy of members and the exits of nerves that move the body should attempt this.
Chapter XLIX.
On cutting off leprosy.
If leprosy becomes old and does not respond to any medical treatment, then cut it with a knife at a depth slightly greater than the thickness of the skin until the white disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with powdered lens, mixed with rose-scented oil from the tail of a donkey and pigeon's blood or hen's blood, with each ingredient in equal parts. Mix everything together and apply it to a cloth, pressing the mixture onto the area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On Cancer.
If cancer is in its beginning stages and you wish to stop it, apply a circular iron (or hot tool) around it, as if it were spinning. Some wise men have said that a strong burn in the middle of the tumor is beneficial, but I do not agree with this, for I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this happen multiple times.
The correct approach is to apply a circular burn around it, as we have said, or numerous burns.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the Treatment of Ganglions.
If a ganglion forms and its growth is slow, either due to the inherent nature of the tissue, old age and a patient's poor health (if they are elderly and anemic), or due to time, and you wish to expedite its maturation, then apply numerous small burns around it in a droplet-like fashion.
Then leave it, for it will mature quickly. If you wish to stop the process with heat, use an iron (or hot tool) as shown in this image.
Insert it in the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be below it to facilitate the discharge of pus, then treat it as it should until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the gangrenous ulcer.
A gangrenous ulcer is nothing but a corruption that moves in the member and eats it, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see a gangrenous ulcer in a place where burning with fire is possible, protect it with many small and large nails, according to what suits that place where the ulcer is located.
Then cauterize it from all sides until the corruption is entirely eliminated, and leave it for three days. Then apply sulfur powder mixed with oil to the burned areas to remove all scabs and corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh. If, after three days, you see that the flesh has grown back healthily with no corruption, then repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupt areas. The gangrenous ulcer can also be treated with sharp medications.
It acts like fire, being more beneficial, and I have mentioned its treatment with sharp medications in the sections before. Take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Third.
On the Use of Reversed and Unreversed Nails.
This ailment often occurs in the soles of the feet, presenting as a rough, painful condition. It can be treated with heat, either by fire or hot water.
As for treatment with fire, it involves heating a hollow iron tool shaped like a falcon's feather on all sides around the nail, making the edge thin, then applying this to the nail while rotating the hand with the tool around the nail until the heat reaches the nail's depth.
It is left for three days to form pus, then dressed with crushed herbage mixed with salt. The bandage is left for a night, after which the nail is removed from its root and the wound treated with a meat-promoting ointment until healed, if the nails are not reversed.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, particularly in the hands and feet. One should use a tube of copper or iron or a falcon's feather, applying it to the nail or verruca and then pouring a small amount of hot water into the tube.
Grip the hand and rotate it, slightly squeezing with your other hand to affect the margin of the tube at the base of the nail. Allow the sharp water to penetrate to the base of the nail, and let the patient bear the stinging sensation of the sharp water for a moment.
Then leave it, for the nail will come out at its roots. You should do this to each one until you have treated all of them in the body, then attend to their wounds after they have come out, using ointments that promote tissue regeneration.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the section on the poultice.
If a poultice, due to cold or fever or any other condition, becomes stuck on the nerve, one should apply four or five burns along the spine at intervals between each burn, and also make a burn on the chest. And on his abdomen, make a burn with the olive iron, for the poultice will calm down and expedite the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the poultice occurring on the body.
When ugly boils appear in the body, caused by cold, dense, and corrupt materials, it is advisable, upon their first emergence, to burn each boil gently with a stick of ash whose end has been ignited, or with the root of long turmeric, or with a lentil-shaped iron.
Boils, upon their first appearance, should be treated in this manner so that they do not increase or spread, and the patient recovers completely, except that this should follow a let-down (phlebitis) procedure.
Chapter LXVI.
On burning (the method used) for stopping bleeding caused by cutting an artery.
Bleeding from an artery that has been severed often occurs due to a wound on the outside, or when a tumor is incised, or when a member (limb) is burned, and so on, making it difficult to cut off.
If such a thing happens to anyone, quickly move your hand to the mouth of the artery, place your index finger over it and apply pressure until the blood is contained beneath your finger and does not escape, then take several small and large burnishers (hot instruments), heat them in the fire until they are very hot, and blow on them.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has burst, and press the iron on the same vein after removing your finger with the wheel and gripping the iron until the blood stops.
If, when removing your finger from the artery's opening, the blood flows out and the iron cools down, take another iron from the pile prepared over the fire using the wheel, and continue to apply one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve, as this may cause further harm to the patient. Know that if an artery bleeds, it is not possible to cut it, especially if it is a large artery, unless one of four methods is used: either by burning as we have mentioned, or by amputation if it has not already severed. If the artery is amputated, both ends will contract and the blood will stop. It can be secured with tight stitches or treated with medications designed to halt the flow of blood, and then supported with strips of fabric.
Those who attempt to tie, tighten with cloth, or apply burning substances or similar methods will not succeed in cutting it off entirely, except rarely. If such a situation arises without the presence of a doctor or medicine, they should immediately place their index finger over the wound's opening as described.
He is gripped so tightly that the blood collects and flows from the wound, over the artery and onto the finger. It does not leave until it is exposed to extremely cold water, until the blood freezes, thickens and cuts off. During this time, he should examine what needs cauterization or treatment.
The Second Chapter
In incisions, punctures, lances and wounds, etc.
As we mentioned in the first chapter, every disease that responds to fire and burning medicine, along with its causes, symptoms, tools, cauterization techniques, and illustrations of instruments, has been treated in detail and organized into sections from ancient times down to modern times.
I will follow the same approach in this chapter to make it easier for students to achieve their goals.
Before I begin, you should know, O children, that this chapter contains even more risks than the first one on cauterization.
Therefore, a strong warning is necessary as the work in this chapter often involves excessive loss of blood, which supports life. This can occur when opening a vein, making an incision on a tumor, draining pus, treating a wound, extracting an arrow, or performing surgery on stones, among other things, all of which carry risks and fear, and often result in death.
And I advise you to avoid things that are doubtful, for in this profession various types of people will come to you with different ailments; some may be weary from their illness and indifferent to death.
Due to the intensity of their suffering, the duration of their illness, and the obvious signs of death from the disease, some will offer you their wealth in exchange for health, while others will despair and see their illness as a battle, so you must not seek help from those who have such characteristics.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and careful consideration, and do not proceed with any treatment without certain knowledge that confirms the favorable outcome, utilizing the advance of knowledge and warning about the results of safety in all the treatments for your patients.
For in this, you will find assistance in acquiring praise, glory, and gratitude; may God guide you, my sons, to wisdom and success, for that is in His hand, there is no god but Him.
I have organized this chapter into sections, as previously discussed in the chapter on cauterization from the tip to the root, so that it will be easy for you to find what you need from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of water accumulation in the heads of children.
This condition often afflicts children at birth when the midwife applies excessive force during delivery, and it may also arise from an underlying hidden illness that is unknown.
I have not encountered this condition in any other gender, and all those I have observed from whom it arises, meet a swift death; therefore, I have abandoned treatment for it, having seen a child whose head became filled with water, and the head increased in size each day. Even the child could not sit due to the enlargement of his head and the increasing moisture, until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone or beneath the bone on the peritoneum; in that case, one should make a single incision across the middle of the head for a small tumor, about two fingers long, to drain the moisture, and this is an image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is excessive and the tumor greater, make them two intersecting incisions as per this image:
If the moisture is beneath the bone and its sign is that you see the head stitches open on all sides, and the water decreases when pressed with your hand, clearly visible to you; in this case, one should make three incisions across the middle of the head as per this image.
After the incision, all moisture is expelled, and then the wounds are bound with bandages and dressings. On the fifth day, the bindings are loosened and the wound is treated with twists and ointments, without over-tightening the head dressing. The patient should be given dry food with little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals, another description of the incision: observe where the bone of the tumor is visible and the accumulation of fluid, as it may be more in the back of the head or at the front, or on the right or left side.
You intend the incision where the tumor and water accumulation are visible; make it as best you can, taking care not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur, leading to the patient's death from such loss of blood, along with vomiting up the moisture.
Chapter Two
Cutting the arteries behind the ears, known as the sensitve ones.
When a sudden attack affects the eyes or chest, and persists despite attempts to treat it with medications, the most effective remedy is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a coarse cloth to expose the artery. Next, tighten the patient's neck with the help of a garment, and observe where the pulse is strongest; these are the two weakest spots behind the ears, visible in most people.
Then learn their positions with ink, and cut them with the scalpel transverse to the bone, making the incision as wide as the head of a finger, or you may introduce the scalpel from beneath the artery and cut it up towards the top. The length of the cut should be about two fingers' width when joined together.
If the sweat gland is cut off, the blood will flow pulsatingly, leaping forward and receding repeatedly; if the artery cannot be felt, measure from the ear with three fingers' length, then mark it with ink and make an incision to the bone.
The blood sends six pulses on average, or perhaps more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries. Then examine the wound; if any part of the peritoneum remains attached to the bone, cut it away.
To prevent a hot swelling, then tighten the wound with a thread of cotton cloth and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter III
On the arteries in the temple.
If a person suffers from a chronic condition such as persistent inflammation or severe pain in the temple muscles, or chronic headaches, and has been treated with various medical remedies without success, we have found that cutting (or cauterizing) the arteries in the temples can be effective for these conditions.
The method of operation on the skull involves shaving the hair from the temples, targeting the visible artery in the temple. Through this, you will discern its pulse, and rarely does it remain hidden except from those with exceptional knowledge.
If, in the chill of cold, it remains hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with his garment, then you can rub the area with a cloth or apply hot water to make the artery clearly visible. Then take the scalpel, whose image this is. Then, using the scalpel, carefully peel away the skin until you reach the artery. Next, insert a hook and pull it upwards to extract it from beneath the skin, freeing it from all attachments on either side. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then, cut a portion from it, as much as the distance between its ends allows, without causing bleeding. If it is not amputated or severed, the blood will not flow at all. Then, drain the blood using six to three openings.
If the artery is large, it should be tied at two points with a strong, doubled thread. The thread can be either flax or string from a lute, to prevent putrefaction from reaching it before the wound heals, which could cause bleeding.
Then, cut the surplus between the two ligatures. You can do this at that moment or later, and if you wish to cauterize it with a hot iron in the form of a thin knife, it will sever its ends, thus serving the same purpose or even better as we have said.
If the patient suffers from fever or a disturbed mood, cauterization is beneficial in expelling humors, making it even more effective. After releasing the ligatures, the wound should be filled with old cotton and covered with tight bandages. Subsequently, it should be treated with dry medicinal herbs to promote tissue regeneration and twisting until healing occurs, God willing.
If, while working, bleeding occurs from an artery, immediately cut it either with a hot iron or by filling the wound with ash and pressing hard until the blood stops. If nothing is at hand, put your finger in the wound to prevent further bleeding until help arrives.
Apply ice-cold water to the wound until the pain subsides and then tightly bandage it as necessary. Removing an artery is easier and simpler than you might think; cauterize the sweat glands with this two-bladed hot iron after marking the positions with dye.
Apply a hot iron with great care until it reaches the bone, severing the sweat gland at two points to separate its ends. It will not heal with this cauterization. This is an illustration of the iron.
The blades of the scissors are sharp, resembling two small pads, but they are much less sharp than a knife. For if they are as sharp as a knife, the cold would come to them more quickly and the meat would not be cut smoothly. If there is any roughness in them, they will grip the hot flesh.
Cutting the meat quickly is the best and most effortless action, and it should be done with a gap between the scissors' blades as wide as a finger's thickness.
Chapter IV
In the treatment of constant, hot tear drainage into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and the drainage is from the veins on the skull outside, and no benefit is derived from medical treatments with drugs, and you observe redness in the patient's face. He feels a tingling on his forehead, similar to the sensation of ants' bites, and his eyes are weak, watery, with dried-up lashes and stuck-together eyelids due to the intensity of tears. Initially, treatment involves this procedure, known as "saber treatment," where you instruct the patient to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then, make three parallel cuts on the forehead, each about two fingers in length, running horizontally across the forehead. The first cut is centered on the nose, the second is slightly away from the muscle movement in the temple, and the third is on the opposite side.
Beware of cutting the arteries on both sides, and keep your hand away from the contact between the jaws. After each incision, leave a distance of three fingers, and have sponge pieces or dry cloth ready to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp scalpel as depicted in this image. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, scrape off all the skin between the incisions, along with the fascia on the bone, and then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision before removing the scalpel. Also, insert another instrument called a scalpel with one sharp and the other smooth side, as depicted here: .
Place the sharp side of the scalpel towards the tissue attached to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, then push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all vessels descending from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision to the other, after allowing enough time for the blood to clot, squeeze the areas to remove the solid blood clots, and then insert a cotton thread in each incision, placing a dressing soaked in a mixture of wine, oil, or vinegar and oil.
To prevent a hot swelling, on the third day, loosen the bandage and use a lot of warm water for fomentation, then treat it with a basilicon ointment mixed with rose oil and other remedies used to treat wounds until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter V.
Treating eye tremors and discharge from the inner head.
When a person experiences frequent, severe, persistent eye discharge, causing the eyes to appear weak, small, and with reduced vision, along with irritated and fallen eyelids, and the loss of eyelashes. There is a sharp, painful sensation in the depths of the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, one knows that these materials and discharge originate from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for them is as follows: order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead.
There is a sharp, painful sensation in the depths of the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, one knows that these materials and discharge originate from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for them is as follows: order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single cut through the middle of the forehead. Or, make the cut slightly higher in a horizontal direction, starting from the left side of the temple to the right side, reaching the bone. Remove your hand away from the moving muscles of the temples when chewing until the bone is exposed and all blood absorption has occurred with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the cut with old cotton or a twist of linen, then tighten it from above with bandages and make the bandages absorb the drink and oil so that there is no hot swelling. If, when you remove the bandage, you see that the hot swelling has subsided, but the bone is exposed, you should rub the bone until new flesh grows on it.
Then treat it with the drying remedy that promotes tissue regeneration, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colphonia, preparing a paste from them, and using it to promote tissue growth in such wounds.
Chapter VI.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or semi-stone such as iron and glass, or a plant seed like lentils and nuts, or something liquid such as water, vinegar, and the like.
And if it is an animal, when a stone falls into the ear, or of the type of stone, not too large to remain in the ear, and it is received by the ear towards the sun, then pour some violet or camphor oil into it, and try to remove it with head movements or sniffing with a blowpipe. And plug the nostrils when sneezing comes, after placing a bandage around the ear with cloth or wool and pulling the ear up towards the jaw. This treatment often removes the stone. If it does not come out, then try to remove it gently using an instrument of this type.
If the foreign body does not come out, try to remove it with a delicate blind hook. If it still does not come out, make a tube of copper and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole.
Seal around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that the wind has no other path but the tube. Then pull it strongly and repeatedly, and it will usually come out. If it does not come out as described, take a small amount of bird glue or prepared glue used to catch birds, and place it at the end of the rod.
After wrapping it tightly with a cotton ball, insert it gently into the ear hole after the ear dries from moisture. If it does not come out as described, hurry to make an incision before the hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision involves first draining the patient's eardrum of fluid, if necessary, and then positioning the patient between your hands, turning their ear up, and making a small cut at the base of the ear, close to its lowest point.
The incision should be in the shape of a crescent, reaching down to the stone. Then, using suitable instruments, remove the stone and quickly sew up the cut, treating it until it heals.
And if a foreign body falls into the ear from one of the grains that grow and swell, attempt to remove it as we have mentioned. If it does not come out, then take a thin, delicate knife as depicted here.
And try to cut that type of grain that has fallen into the ear, but only if you are certain that the seed has become softened by the steam of the ear, making it into small pieces, and then remove them with a hook, or a delicate dry cloth, or by sucking.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove them. For water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use a sniffing treatment with a sponge or something similar, while lying on the affected ear, using some old cotton wool if necessary, and then check if the water has come out.
Or, take many small, smooth stones and warm them slightly over fire. Then, the patient should insert one stone into the ear hole while leaning on one leg and striking with another stone, creating a rhythm on the stone inside the ear.
He should continue this process with each stone until all water is removed. It can also be done by using a reed or feather, placing one end inside the ear and igniting the other end to create steam, which will help expel the remaining water.
Do this several times until all water has exited or draw it out with a pipe, as mentioned regarding the stone. As for removing the animal that has entered it, if it is small-bodied like a tick and the like, treat it as mentioned in the classification.
If the body is large and visible, try to remove it using tweezers and forceps; this is easier than all other objects embedded in the ear. As for removing worms that have formed in the ear, if you treat them as mentioned in the classification of parasites, and your treatment does not work.
You should examine the ear in sunlight; if you notice any worms, remove them with tweezers or delicate forceps. If nothing is visible, take a pipe shaped as follows.
It should be narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as tolerated by the patient, then suck strongly with it. Do this several times until all worms have exited. If it does not come out, plug around the pipe with wax as mentioned regarding stones.
If it does not come out as mentioned, use the parasites that the pioneers have used to kill worms, and you will find this in the article on parasites. You should apply oils and medications into the ear using this instrument, and here is its shape:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If you wish, the piston inside the tube can be of tight copper. If you prefer, take a rod and tightly wrap cotton around its end.
Then, place the fat, or juice, or any of these medications into the tube and insert it into the ear. Then, use the rod with the cotton at the end and squeeze it gently with your hand until the fat enters the inner ear and you feel it.
Let the patient be inside, and whatever you pour into the ear should be slightly warmed in the fire. Be careful that what drips into it is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate such extremes.
Chapter VII
On the treatment of an ear blockage.
Some children may be born with their eardrums unperforated.
Some people may also experience a blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing inside, and this blockage can be deep within the ear hole, invisible to the naked eye.
If the foreign body protrudes slightly from the hole and is visible, it is usually difficult to remove. If it is deeply embedded in the ear and not visible, it will be even more challenging to extract. In such cases, the patient's affected ear should be exposed to sunlight. If, upon inspection, the blockage is visible, open it with a delicate scalpel. Here is its appearance: .
The blade should have a slightly curved end, with both sides smooth to avoid damaging the ear. If the blockage is caused by tissue growth within the ear canal, use a fine hook and carefully cut it away, ensuring all tissue is removed without causing harm.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a mild, smooth curve and warm it slightly over fire. Then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage and the patient experiences hearing difficulty due to weight, gently remove the plug.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum. Create a wick inside the ear canal, cut to the size of the opening, soaked in Egyptian ointment, and use it for several days until healing is assured or take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered glass on it.
If the ear becomes swollen and hot, remove the wick and replace it with a new one soaked in rose oil-based paste to alleviate the swelling and heat. Then continue treatment until healing occurs.
If there is bleeding, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use all other treatments to stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the article on catheters.
Chapter VIII.
In the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry, so they should be seized with a file or hook and cut off at the root with a scalpel, then the site should be treated with powdered glass.
If blood flows from them, remove them with a gentle lenticular iron, and applying heat afterward is better after cutting, as they often return if any roots remain. If roasted with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Chapter IX.
In the treatment of cold affecting the eyelids.
Often, something resembling cold exhibits itself in the eyelids with great intensity and hardness.
And therefore it is called cold, being the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment involves examining it; if the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to all sides, then its case is simple, and you should make a vertical cut through it.
Then, peel it gently from all sides until you are free, then hang it on a hook and cut it. If it is not possible to cut it except after the eyelid has been completely cut, this will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, sew it together and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no need to worry, as the ointment will heal and seal it. If the eyelid is inclined towards the inside surface, turn it upside down and hang the edge of the eyelid on a hook without the need for an incision, then cut it from all sides.
If the incision penetrates the eyelid, it will not harm the patient. Then, after cutting off the edge of the eyelid, wash the eye with salt water and treat the area to seal it until the patient heals.
Chapter X.
In the treatment of the ulcer that appears on the eyelid.
The ulcer (or "sharnak") is a fleshy growth that occurs on the upper layers of the eyelid, most commonly affecting children. It can weigh on their eyes and cause discharge at night, making it difficult for them to see in sunlight. Due to the rapid flow of tears towards them.
Therefore, they rest and sleep on their faces, with their eyelids wet under their eyebrows, inflated and the hernia visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the hernia between them. The proper procedure is for the patient to lie their head in your lap.
Then take a cotton cloth, prepare a thread from it, and make a circle with that thread around the hernia from all sides. Place it on top and press from all sides to gather the hernia in the center of the circle.
Then, using a scalpel, make a vertical cut through the center of this moisture, not larger than the cut made during phlebotomy. Deeply, you should cut through all the skin to reach the hernia.
In most cases, the hernia emerges from the cut as a white fat piece, which you can draw out with a cloth wrapped between your fingers, rotating your hand right and left until it is free. Be careful not to increase the cut, otherwise, the scalpel may slip and injure the eye.
If the hernia does not appear at first in the cut, you should gently increase the depth of the cut slightly until it emerges. Then, draw it out as we have said, and dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and secure it with bandages. Some people prefer to apply salt.
He places it within the wound to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treats it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, he treats it with soothing remedies until it heals.
Chapter XI.
In cases of eye tightness.
If growths develop on the eyelid, forming additional folds that deviate from the natural shape and become persistent, they can damage the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, drooping eyelids, white patches, and opacification, potentially leading to visual impairment.
The tightening of the eye can be achieved through four methods: either by burning with fire, or with sharp drugs as mentioned in the chapter on burning, or by cutting and stitching, or by using reeds.
You should place the patient's head in your lap and, with your left hand, turn the eyelid. If it turns easily, insert a needle with a thread beneath the eyelid, pass the needle through from above, close to the hair itself, and draw the thread up to lift the eyelid.
Turn the eyelid with a palper, then incise within the eyelid, but not through the excess hair, using a delicate scalpel from the outer corner (margins) to the inner corner (canthus). Remove the thread, place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and secure it with sutures.
Like the shape of the lotus leaf, but the shape should be adjusted according to the desired amount of eyelid elevation, as people may vary in this regard. Some may require cutting a suitable portion from the eyelid depending on its relaxation.
Others may require even less cutting, depending on the relaxation of the eyelid, then make incisions with a scalpel along the two lines you have marked, starting from the outer corner of the eye towards the inner corner, with each incision close to the natural lashes, similar to the thickness of a thread.
Then, the forceps are inserted into one corner of the skin and it is completely stripped away. The eyelids are then sutured together with a fine needle and thread, any blood is wiped away, and remaining threads are secured to the eyebrows with some adhesive substances.
You may choose to do this or not, but either way, the stitches and threads will remain for approximately three or four days. Alternatively, you can leave the wound untreated, applying substances to dry and contract it; however, closing the wound and stitching it together is preferable as it improves the final result.
This method of tightening the eyelid, mentioned in the earliest texts, is indeed beneficial for the patient and carries no risk. There is another approach to tightening the eyelid, which involves shaping it like the lotus leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps, either separated or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the remaining part of the eyelid with a small scissors, cutting it evenly as shown:
If you cannot hold the forceps, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger eyelid and a third thread near the smaller eyelid. Then, gently gather the threads between your fingers and raise your hand slightly.
Raise the entire marked skin as we described, then sew together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during cutting or incising, soothe it with poultices or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also be affected, with its lashes turning inside out. In such cases, one should use the techniques mentioned: cutting, stitching, and compressing with fire or sharp drugs. Compressing with fire or sharp drugs is more effective and less traumatic for the patient than cutting and stitching.
Compressing with cane (or wood) is done as follows: invert the eyelid and make an incision from inside, as described. Then create two thin strips or reeds, each the length of the eyelid and narrower than a surgical blade.
And having borrowed from both sides of their extremities where the threads adhere, then gathering them gently over what remains of the eyelid, and tightening the eyelids tightly from both sides, leaving it for days; for the stretched skin will die and turn black and putrefy.
Until it falls by itself, if it delays, borrow it with a chisel and then treat it until it heals. If it adheres, the eyelid will rise, and the eyelashes will not be damaged; this is the shape and size of the eyelids made in this way, the same length and width:
Chapter XII.
Raising the detached hair from the eye with a needle.
If it is a single hair or two, the work involves taking a fine needle and inserting a thin, smooth silk thread into it. Then gather the ends together and tie them with a very delicate knot. Let the length of the thread be about an inch.
Then, compose another thin thread in the bandage, shorter than the previous one, and tie its ends as desired. Then, have the patient lie down on your lap, close to the sun to clearly see the work, as it is a delicate task. Then, insert the needle with the bandage into the root of the excess hair.
Perform this operation on the eyelid with haste until you extract it above the natural hair, then pull the thread over the ligature and insert it into that ligature, whether one, two, or three hairs at most.
Then, pull with your hand until the hair comes out with the ligature in the eyelid with the natural hair; if you pull the ligature but the hair does not come out with it, pull the ligature down with the thread that you inserted into it until the ligature comes out of the upper hole.
Then, put the hair back in and pull both until it rises in the upper hole and you see it with your own eye. At that point, release the ligature and thread and remove them, then close the eye and leave it tight for two or three days until the hair takes its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a longer hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after some time, then raise it.
Chapter XIII.
In the treatment of the gap (or separation) that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The condition to which this gap is exposed is called a palpebral gap, and this gap can either be natural or accidental. The accidental gap occurs due to the healing of a wound, a cut, a burn, or something similar.
In performing this operation, incise the scab, spread apart its edges, and insert a thread of linen between them, then bind it until healing occurs, without using drying or constricting agents for treatment.
If you do this, the wound will heal more severely than before, and instead of drying agents, use things that relax it, such as fennel seeds soaked in water with cumin and flaxseed, and a paste of diachylon mixed with fat, apply it to the thread and treat the wound with it.
The key to treating it is to strive by all means for the wound not to heal in the same shape as before, and this operation that we mentioned is only part of repairing the wound, not to restore the area to its original state.
Chapter XIV
In treating wounds on the lower eyelid.
The wound that occurs on the lower eyelid, which is truly called a "stra" (wound), is natural and occurs randomly, whether from a cut, tear, or burn, etc.
The procedure involves taking an needle with a doubled thread and sewing it into the flesh, passing it through from the left corner of the eye to the right, until the thread is in both corners of the flesh, then lifting the flesh above with the needle and cutting it with a broad scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is necessary, otherwise take a rod and place it on the site of the cut and turn the eyelid with it, making two cuts on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the cuts will be from the angles of the cut that was made until they meet, forming an angle. Until they meet, it will form a shape similar to this: .
It is a Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below the eyelid, and gather the scattered parts with two stitches, stitching it with woolen thread, and treat it with the relaxing drugs and twisting as we mentioned until it heals.
If the injury was due to a cut, stitching, or burning, then one should make a simple cut without affecting the hairs of the eyelids, as mentioned before, and separate the eyelids with twisting as we described.
In conclusion, when treating an injury to the eyelid, whether it is from above or below, one should perform the procedure according to what presents itself as the nature of the injury, as it can vary greatly in appearance; the surgeon must adapt their method as best they can.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approximates it, and the same disease indicates what is suitable for it in terms of treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter XV.
In the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may prevent many people from moving their eyelid freely, obstructing its natural functions, and therefore a thin rod should be inserted under the lid.
It should then be raised or extended with a hook, and the adhesion cut with a delicate scalpel that is not too sharp to avoid disturbing the patient, preventing the scalpel from slipping and potentially harming the eye with its edge, as if peeling off the adhesion.
And when the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, you should then pour warm salty water into the eye or apply drops of a solution of zingar (a type of wood) in water, and finally separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton thread.
Place a wet woolen compress over the eye, and after three days, use warm compresses until it heals.
Chapter XVI.
In the removal of the tendon and healing of the flesh of the regions.
The tendon is of two kinds: either nerve-bound, resembling a thin, firm membrane; or non-nerve-bound, resembling a hard, white substance that, when touched by metal or caught with a hook, readily breaks off.
And if a hook does not adhere to it, both types begin from the larger eye and gradually become more firmly attached until they cover the sight and prevent light and movement of the eye; in the process of cutting them, the patient should rest their head on your lap.
Then open the patient's eyes, raise the eyelid with your hand, grab the tendon with a slightly flexible hook, and pull it upwards. Then take a needle and insert a horse or cow hair and a strong thread into it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and sew it in the middle of the tendon.
And pass the needle through, tying the tendon with the thread, pulling it upwards, and scraping the side of the tendon next to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it out with the hair to its end. Then cut the rest at the base of the eye with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the eye.
To prevent permanent tear-staining, the tendon may be pulled with a hook alone or with the thread as mentioned, then scraped with the smooth-ended scalpel, as illustrated below:
Be cautious that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, as it may cause a rupture leading to pupil dilation. After cutting, apply some powdered salt or zingar (a type of spice) to the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the eyelid is non-nervous and neither an needle nor a hook can be inserted into it, this type of eyelid often heals on its own with medication, as described in the previous section. If you decide to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a delicate, smooth scalpel as shown in the image. Carefully remove the eyelid from above with a delicate scalpel. If you notice that it is loose, brittle, and separates easily, apply some zingar (a type of spice) or red dye or powdered salt to the eye and leave it for another day.
Then, continue the process until all of it is removed, unless a hot, swollen lump appears in the eye. In this case, leave it and treat the swelling until it heals, then resume the process of removing the eyelid.
If the tent (presumably a growth or mass) severely irritates the eye, attach it with a hook and cut off some of it, but do not excessive cutting to prevent excessive tearing. Then, apply red dye or zingar (a type of spice) to the eyes to heal.
Chapter XVII.
In the amputation of the legs and the removal of excessive flesh growing around the eye.
In some people, a red flesh may grow around the eye, overlapping or nearly covering the pupil, and sometimes overflowing onto the eyelids, turning them inside out and resembling the rose of Jinnar.
The procedure involves the patient lying on their back, and then opening their eyes while using suitable pincers to extract all the red flesh.
Either use a scalpel, as described for cutting the nail, or small scissors to remove it, ensuring not to harm the eye during the process. as the pincers used to capture the splinters, as illustrated in the following door (referring to an image or diagram).
After removing the excess flesh, fill the eye with ground salt or drop in some red dust (a drying agent) and apply a clean cotton ball soaked in egg white from outside to prevent excessive swelling.
If there remains something from the operation and blood overcomes you and you fear a hot tumor, then leave the eye and treat it with what soothes the tumor, then return to work on it until it heals, and do the same with any excess tissue that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating every weak eye through natural means or by performing any operation with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these treatments unless you see that the organ is suitable for such work.
Chapter XVIII
On the procedure for removing foreign bodies from the eye.
The vessels, red and woven across the eye, obstruct vision and weaken the eye over time. Therefore, you should first examine it. If the eye with the foreign body is strong and has no other illness besides the foreign body,
Then, the procedure (for removing the foreign body) is as follows: You should instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then use a hook to attach these vessels, either one or two, depending on your skill. The hooks should be flexible and curved like this:
or use two hooks attached to a single body, curved like this:
Then, using a delicate scissors, gently snip the vessels and wipe away the blood from time to time until the eye perceives that the vessels have vanished and the blood has drained. Be careful with the eye, do not hurt it with the scissors' tips, and work during the middle of the day facing the sun.
And be diligent in your work so as not to cut any vessels other than the ones intended, and upon finishing, apply eye drops of green or red vitreous to consume the remaining vessels with its sharpness; if you cannot remove them all at that time, dress the eye with a remedy to soothe its pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the swelling disappears, then resume work on it with the same care until it heals completely.
Leave it [with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, one drying the tear ducts and ensuring clear vision in the front and back of the eye, while you] focus on opening the eye with fixed or triangular keys held by a student.
Be precise, with the patient's head resting on the student's lap, one drying the tear ducts and ensuring clear vision in the front and back of the eye, while you have the option to begin snipping from either above or below the eye; ideally, dry two threads on the upper side, one at the end of the eyelid and the other at its beginning.
Grip it between the middle and index fingers, then attach pincers underneath. Hold it again between the ring and little fingers, and gently lift your hand to see if the tendons have risen. Cut the lateral tendon with scissors or a delicate scalpel.
The needle should be inserted through the tendon, and you should examine it until it rises on the flesh without cutting the tendons, as blood and serum may spill onto you.
Then, cut with scissors what exceeds the tendon both above and below, so that nothing remains attached except the cornea. If possible, lift it from the cornea using the needle, as this is best, and in some people, it may come off easily.
If you cut it, the wound will heal after several days, and the hot swelling will subside. Then, you can resume working on it.
Chapter XIX.
In the reattachment of the feather to the nose.
The surgeons call the feather a 'nostrum' (a term for a medical remedy). If it does not heal from burning or sharp, pungent medicine as described previously, there is no other recourse but to incise into the tumor when it matures and extract all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed, if it reveals corruption or blackness upon exposure, then remove it with this instrument, which is shaped as follows:
The instrument called "al-khashna al-ras" is made of Indian iron, with a rounded head shaped like a seed or a knife edge, finely engraved like a scalpel or a file. Place it on the affected area of the bone and rotate it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand to ensure that the corruption has been removed.
Repeat this process several times, then treat the wound with drying and constricting medications. If the wound heals, new flesh grows, and no further issues arise for 40 days, it is considered successfully treated.
Know that it has healed, otherwise there is no other remedy but to return the nostril fistula to its original hole. To do this, expose the bone again either with iron or a sharp medicine, and if the bone becomes exposed, take a splint shaped as follows:
The end of the iron should be triangular, and its core should be a reversed cone, as you can see. Place it on the bone itself, close to the eye and slightly away from it, then rotate your hand with the splint until the bone penetrates and is felt by the patient.
By having the patient press their hand against their nose, if they feel air coming out, then treat the wound with constricting and drying medications as previously instructed. If new flesh grows and solidifies, the discharge that used to come out will return to the nose, which is lighter for the patient, God willing.
Chapter XX.
In the repair of the eye's net (or retina).
If the entire retina is detached and no harm or loss to vision occurs, one should ease the patient then fix it in a specific position, then place a plug behind the retina without a set rule, and suck gently.
Then place on the eye a poultice made of mulberry, chamomile, frankincense, and myrrh, then secure the eye with bandages using many strips, where each strip is folded in half four times to make many layers.
Then layer them as needed for the eye, securing each layer with a firm cloth, and continue to suck gently with the plug without a set rule. Remove the plug and leave the eye secured for one day and night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened, and then after one day and night, remove the bandage as mentioned. If you see that the eye has returned to its place, otherwise, repeat the bandaging, applying pressure, and using the plug until it returns.
Chapter XXI.
In amputation of the limb.
If a hernia appears in the fascial layer, then it becomes retracted and protrudes outside the skin like a grape, deforming the human figure, and you wish to amputate it, then proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the hernia from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the opposite side and withdraw it, leaving the first needle in place.
Then, cut the point of curvature of the doubled thread and tie a portion of the hernia around the needle, tightening it well, then remove the needle and apply a wet plaster of egg white to the wound and leave it until the threads fall out with the hernia, then treat the wound to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, the hernia may be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage to enhance the recovery of the eye, then cut open with a thin scalpel reaching the depths of the eye, allowing the egg white fluid to drain, and the eye will recede, droop, and eventually heal.
Chapter Twenty-Second.
On the Treatment of Fistulas.
This condition, known as the coma, is a period in which the eye accumulates fluid similar to descending water, but without it. The method of treatment involves having the patient sit on an upright chair and then holding their head with both hands from the sides.
And you should move it until you see the period flow downward with your eye, then become stationary and do not disappear, allowing light to pass and enabling the patient to see objects as they normally would. If the period does not flow downward, we know that it is not water; if it does not prepare for the descent as mentioned.
If this does not work, then place the patient between your hands and take a thin scalpel, and make a small cut above the cornea at the junction of the sclera and the cornea, allowing the material to exit.
If it exits, rinse the eye with hot water mixed with honey or water boiled with fennel and honey, then apply all other treatments until healing occurs.
Chapter 23.
As we have mentioned the types of water in the classification, and which one is suitable for the cup with an expanded explanation, take it from there for the health. At that time, you should have the patient sit between your hands, squatting, facing the light near the sun.
Secure and fix the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid of the affected eye with your left hand if it is the left eye with the water, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the instrument near the acropolis, at a right angle to the inner corner of the eye, and push the instrument strongly while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the instrument reach something hollow.
It should go as deep as the distance from the cornea to the farthest point of darkness (the limbus), for you will see the copper in the same way by the viewer as the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then continue the instrument above to the position where the water is.
Then press it down repeatedly; if the water flows out, the patient will see what their vision allows from that moment on, and the instrument will be in their eye. Then pause for a little while. If the water rises again, lower it a second time without removing the instrument.
If it stabilizes and does not rise, carefully remove the instrument while twisting your hand slightly, then dissolve a little pure salt in water and wash the eye from inside out. Apply a damp compress or cloth over the entire eye externally.
Moisturize the eye with rose oil and white of eggs, and tie it with a healthy eye. As for us and our contemporaries, we place crushed cumin with the white of eggs on it. If the point (of light) does not enter the eye due to its hardness, as some people have eyes that are very hard. One should take the surgical knife, called the 'bried', whose image is shown here.
Drill through only the conjunctiva with this knife, without going deep. Lightly tap the point (of the knife) into position, then insert the point as we have described. Once your work is complete, prepare the patient to lie down comfortably on their back in a dark room.
Abstain from all movements, coughing, and make the patient's food soft to suit their condition. Do not move the patient's head to the right or left at all. Leave the bandage in place until the third day, then remove it in that dark room and test their sight.
Show him objects, then re-bandage until the seventh day. Do not do this during treatment or after probing with your instrument, but rather avoid it beforehand, as the water can quickly rise due to intense looking.
If a hot tumor appears, unbandage the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something to soothe the tumor until it subsides. Once it has subsided, release the patient's sight, place a veil over their face for several days in that dark room to help them train their eyes.
The treatment progresses gradually and addresses its causes. Know that in this art, the learner cannot do without observation; he must see it done several times before attempting the procedure. I have been told by some Iraqis that he described a special instrument from Iraq that sucks up water.
I have never seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the early books, and this might be a recent development. Here is an illustration of various types of instruments to help one understand them.
They are made especially of copper, with an end that is equally delicate and shaped like a triangle with a sharp point.
Chapter XXIV
In the treatment of flesh that has grown in the nose.
It may grow flesh of various types in the nose, some resembling a mass of many-legged spiders, others a hard, tumor-like cancerous flesh, and some a soft, non-cancerous flesh.
If it is a soft flesh that is neither malignant nor cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun with your hands on his face, opening his nostrils and inserting a hook into the flesh. Then pull it out gently and cut off what you have reached using a delicate, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh is gone, if anything remains, you will not be able to cut it off. Remove it with one of the delicate tools gently so that nothing remains, unless overcome by blood or a hot tumor.
If it faces a malignant tumor, be prompt to cut it off so that the blood stops and all flesh is removed. Then, after the cut, apply a vacuum or liquid to the nose, for if the nose opens and moisture passes through to the throat.
Know that he has healed, if moisture does not pass as it should, know that there is flesh grown inside the bones, detached, and the instrument did not reach and cut it. In this case, you should take a thread of linen slightly thick.
And tie many knots in it, placing each knot about the thickness of a finger or less. The patient then inserts one end of the thread into his nose using a rod or what he can make similar to a plug, and pulls on it until it reaches the nostrils.
It comes out in a loop, and often boys in school perform such actions. It is easy for whoever desires it. Then, you collect the ends of the thread: one end emerges from the mouth, and the other remains in the nose.
Then, you use the thread to cut through the meat with the knots. Do this until you know that the flesh is cut by the thread's knots. Then, remove the thread and, after wiping away the blood with a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian ointment, repeat this process for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh, and then it becomes a lead pipe in the nose for several days until it heals, if treatment is needed, drying should be used.
And this is an image of the nasal dropper through which oils and medicines are dripped into the nose:
A silver or copper object resembling a small jellyfish with an open container and a similar passage is placed there.
And if you prefer, the pipe can be made closed like a tube, and the container of the nasal dropper flat.
It has a handle at the end, as you can see, to hold it if you heat oil or any extract or flowing substance in it.
Chapter 25
On the warts that grow at the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows at the tip of the nose, increasing in size over time until it becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it should be cut off as soon as it appears and all of it removed. Then, either cauterization or a burning medicine that acts like cauterization should be applied to the site. If it cannot be cut off until it grows large, examine it; if it has become hardened and colorless with little sensation, then...
Do not approach it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen great harm result from cutting into such a tumor. Even if the tumor is soft to the touch and not discolored, I believe it can be cut entirely. So induce vomiting in the patient and cut it without caution or delay, and treat the wound with astringents to dry and contract it until healing occurs.
Chapter XXVI.
In sewing the nose, lip, and ear. If the connection breaks away from a wound or similar injury, know that once the attachment of any of these cartilages is severed, little benefit will be gained from treatment in most cases, except for certain individuals.
If any of this is encountered, one should examine if the wound is still fresh and filled with blood. Gather the edges of the wound together with stitches, then treat it until healing occurs. If the connection has completely separated, revealing two distinct parts, one should gently peel each separate edge, exposing as much of its skin as possible, until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges together with stitches, tighten them, and apply a mixture of frankincense and myrrh, powdered, to the wound, followed by a layer of sealant from an ointment made from palm oil or any other adhesive plaster. Leave it intact for two or three days before removing the stitches.
Change the dressing and leave it until the stitches dissolve on their own, then treat the wound with a salve until it heals. The method of stitching involves bringing together what is separated, either with needles as described in the treatment of abdominal wounds, or with thread as mentioned previously.
Chapter XXVII
In removing knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may present with small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling sebaceous cysts and others smaller or larger. You should turn the lip inside out, make a cut on each knot, and use a hook to remove them.
Cut them from all sides, then fill the cut with powdered alum to stop the bleeding, and afterward rinse with vinegar and salt. Treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter XXVIII
On cutting excess flesh from the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call 'abuls.' You should use a hook or a scalpel to grasp and cut it at its base, allowing the blood to flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
If a corner of the flesh, after treatment, returns to its former state, cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In the inspection of teeth with iron.
It may happen that rough, unpleasant scales gather on the inner and outer surfaces of the teeth and between the gums, becoming blackened, yellowed, or green, leading to damage to the gums and ugliness to the teeth.
You should have the patient sit between your hands and head on your lap, and remove the tooth or the one where scales or something resembling sand is present, until nothing remains of it, as well as with blackness, greenness, yellowing, and so on, in order to purify them.
If what is in it disappears from the first inspection, otherwise repeat the inspection on the following days, second, third, and so on, until you reach your goal. Know that a tooth may require different types of instruments with various shapes according to what presents itself for your work.
For the instrument used to remove a tooth from the inside is different from that used to remove it from the outside, and also differs from that used between the teeth, each with its own shape. These are several instruments, all of which should be prepared for you.
Chapter Thirty
In the removal of teeth.
One should treat the toothache with all means possible and not hesitate to extract it, for it is a noble substance, even if there is no other choice but to remove it.
If the patient decides to extract it, it should be done carefully until the aching tooth is healed. Often, the patient, due to pain, mistakes a healthy tooth for the painful one and extracts it, but the pain does not disappear until the diseased tooth is removed, something we have witnessed repeatedly by chirurgians.
If the aching tooth is correctly identified, one should cut around it with a scalpel that has some force, in order to loosen the gum from all sides, then move it slightly with fingers or delicate tweezers until it becomes loose.
Then, firmly grip the tooth with both forceps, placing the patient's head between your knees for stability, and pull it straight without breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of the instruments and insert it under the tooth on each side, gently pushing and moving it as you initially did.
If a tooth is hollow or decayed, the hole should be filled with a piece of cloth and sealed tightly with a thin rod to prevent it from breaking off while you are pulling it with clamps. The gum around the tooth should be thoroughly examined from all sides.
Be careful not to break it, leaving some inside, which could cause greater harm to the patient than their initial pain. Do not do what the ignorant healers do, pulling teeth without using the methods we have described.
Often, they cause people great harm; the least of which is a broken tooth leaving its roots or some of them intact. Either it pulls out part of the jawbone, as we have seen many times, and then rinse it with a drink or vinegar and salt; if there is bleeding from the site, which often happens, then crush some glass and stuff it into the wound.
If the glass does not help, use a fine-toothed clamp, initially moving the tooth. It should be long with a short handle, thick so it doesn't bend when you grip the tooth. This is the image of the large clamps:
The handles should be thick, as you see, so that when you grip them, they do not give way or bend. They should be short in length, and made of strong iron or steel, with pointed ends that fit together tightly for a secure grip.
And the limbs may be made to resemble shears, being also strongly adjustable.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the removal of the roots of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
If, upon the removal of a tooth, its root has broken off, one should place a piece of fat soaked in lard on the area for one or two days until it relaxes, then insert forceps or pliers. which resemble the edges of a bird's beak, known as a billage, and this is an image of the forceps:
It should be made like a pair of shears from the inside or like an escallop if it does not come out with these forceps, then you should dig into the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the tool that resembles a small lever, as shown in this image:
Short in length and slightly thick, not too slender, otherwise it may break. If the root comes out with this, use these other tools, as shown: the first has a triangular tip with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image:
And we may also make use of this two-bladed instrument, the image of which is here depicted:
And other instruments and blades previously mentioned in the inventory of teeth, we may also make use of this instrument similar to a large plier, the image of which is here depicted:
With three curved points, some slightly thicker to prevent breakage and avoid being dull; know that there are many instruments for teeth, as well as other instruments, which cannot be counted. The skilled craftsman, through his craft, may invent instruments for himself according to what work and diseases indicate.
Because there are diseases for which the first ones did not mention instruments due to their variety; if a bone in the jaw or any bone in the mouth breaks or becomes infected, search for it in its place with one of these instruments and pliers mentioned for removing roots.
And we make use of this pair, the image of which is here depicted:
It has a slightly thicker edge to hold the bone firmly so it does not slip until the bone is removed; we reinforce the site with appropriate medicines, if the bone is slightly rotten, remove the rot and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter XXXII.
On the eruption of teeth into one another.
If teeth erupt in an abnormal position, it distorts the natural order, especially in women and slaves, and one should examine it; if a tooth has erupted behind another.
If it cannot be moved nor pulled back, and it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows:
It resembles a small beak, and it should be made of sharp, fine Indian steel. Use it for multiple cuts over several days to ensure the tooth is removed without affecting others. If it is firmly attached and easily removable, use a dental file from India, whose shape is as follows.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with a very fine-toothed file similar to that used for making needles. File the tooth gently over several days, avoiding any sudden movements to prevent its displacement; then smooth it and remove it using pliers.
If a tooth has broken off and affects the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed gently until the roughness of the break disappears, ensuring it does not harm the tongue or disrupt speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
In the interweaving of mobile teeth with silver or golden threads.
If mobile teeth become shaky and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew anything edible without risking further loss of teeth, after trying and failing with constricting medications.
The trick is to tie a gold or silver thread, with gold being preferable as silver tarnishes and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium softness and thickness to accommodate the space between the teeth.
And the method of interweaving is to take the thread and insert its bend between the healthy teeth, then weave both ends of the thread among the mobile teeth, one or more, until the weaving reaches the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then, weave it back to the starting point, gently and skillfully, ensuring the thread does not move, and tighten it at the bases of the teeth to prevent slippage. Cut off any excess thread with scissors, collect it, twist it tightly, and hide it between the healthy tooth and the mobile tooth.
In order that the tongue may not be wounded, it should then be left in this manner stretched (tension) as long as it lasts. If it slackens or breaks, tighten it with another thread so that it may enjoy this state throughout all time. This is a representation of the teeth and their interlocking condition in two healthy teeth and two mobile teeth, as you see:.
A tooth, or both teeth, may return to its original position after falling out and interlock as described, remaining in place. This is only possible with the skill of a skilled craftsman who carves bone from a cow's skull to create a tooth-like structure for placement in the missing tooth's spot. It is tightened as we have said, remaining in place and enjoying this state.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In cutting the ligament exposed under the tongue, it prevents speech.
This ligament exposed under the tongue may either be a natural feature that humans are born with or it may result from an injury that has healed.
The procedure involves opening the patient's mouth and placing their head in your lap, then lifting their tongue and cutting the nerve ligament running across it horizontally until the tongue is freed from its attachment. If there is some firmness or complexity due to scar tissue from a previous injury, insert a hook and make a horizontal cut through it to sever the ligament and release the tension.
Beware that the incision does not penetrate too deeply into the flesh, for it may sever an artery and cause bleeding. After cutting, rinse with rosewater or a mixture of vinegar and cold water. Then place under the tongue a piece of cotton that the patient holds each night.
If the wound closes before healing, and bleeding occurs, apply powdered glass to the area. If blood persists, use a lens-shaped iron to extract it. Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter 35.
In the removal of the frog that forms under the tongue.
A tumor may form under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural movement and possibly even blocking the mouth, filling it with swelling. The treatment involves opening the patient's mouth facing the sun and examining the tumor.
If you see it as a dark, black, solid mass that the patient cannot feel, do not interfere, for it is cancer. However, if it leans towards white and has moisture, insert a hook in it and cut it with a delicate scalpel from all sides to remove it.
If blood prevails while you are working, apply powdered glass until the blood stops, then return to your work to completely remove it, and afterward rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter XXXVI.
In the treatment of tonsillar swelling.
And any growth in the throat, other than tumors, may present itself as glands inside the throat resembling those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what has been mentioned in the previous sections and they do not heal.
Examine it: if the tumor is solid, of a dark color, and not very sensitive, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its origin is thick, do not either, for fear of bleeding, but leave it until it ripens; either it will discharge on its own or burst from within.
If it is white in color, round, and its origin is thin, this is what should be cut off. The procedure involves looking at it before acting to see if its hot tumor has completely subsided or has decreased in severity.
When ready, seat the patient facing the sun with their head in your lap, open their mouth, and take a servant in both hands to press their tongue down using this instrument: [image or description follows]
The instrument is made of silver or copper, thin as a knife. When pressing it against the tongue to visualize the swelling, insert a hook into the tonsil and pull it outward, taking care not to tug on any adjacent tissues.
Then, cut it with an instrument resembling scissors, except both ends are bent towards each other and extremely sharp. It is crafted from Indian iron or Damascus steel: [image or description follows]
If you do not have this instrument, cut it with a scalpel: [image or description follows]
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other, after cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, rinse the patient's mouth with cold water or a mixture of vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, rinse with boiling water mixed with pomegranate peel or assafoetida or similar astringents until the bleeding stops. Then, treat as mentioned for tonsil infections. Similarly, any other growths in the throat, such as additional tonsil-like swellings, should be cut away.
A woman was treated for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, extending to the epigastrium, almost completely blocking it. The woman's breathing was restricted and she could not eat or drink.
And she was close to death if she had not been treated within a day or two, as the tumor had sent out two branches that emerged from her nostrils. So she acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them and pulled, and a viable piece separated from it.
Then she cut it off at the point where it entered the nostril, and she did the same for the other nostril. She then opened her mouth, pressed her tongue down, inserted the hook into the tumor again, and cut off a piece, leaving only a small amount of blood.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat food. For a long time, they continued to cut off pieces of the tumor, which grew back each time until it had affected both her and me.
I tried and burned the tumor inside the throat with a special tool, which stopped its growth. Then I left the region, not knowing what God had done to her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
In the excision of the tongue's tumor.
Which is called a grape if it descends to the tongue and swells, becoming white, rectangular, it is called a column; and if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a grape. If treatment with what we mentioned in the classification does not succeed.
And I saw that the hot tumor had subsided and it was thin, so it should be cut; and if it is rounded and compact, and has no length, and is purplish or of a black color or has no feeling, then cutting it should be avoided.
So there is a risk for the patient; therefore, when you see it with the mentioned qualities, such as its whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit facing the sun, press his tongue with the instrument described, then insert the hook into the grape.
And pull it down and cut it with one of the instruments mentioned in cutting the tonsils; however, you should only cut what exceeds the natural state without adding more, because if you cut too much, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, you use what we described in the procedure for cutting tonsils and treat it until healing occurs; if the patient refuses to have it cut, then you should use a trick to cauterize it without fear or caution, and the method of cauterization is with a sharp drug, by placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument mentioned, and take from the sharp water (mentioned) in the chapter on cauterization, and knead it with unquenched clay, making it neither too thick nor too thin, and fill the hollows of this instrument with it. And this is its form:
The end of the instrument, which holds the medication, has a hollow shape like a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medication on the tonsil itself, while the patient lies on their side, allowing saliva to flow from their mouth into their throat, preventing any foreign objects from entering and causing harm.
Then grasp the medication in your hand and squeeze it onto the tonsil for half an hour until it turns black and the sting of the medication subsides. If you wish, take a cotton ball, twist it around the instrument, soak it in the medication, and apply it to the tonsil.
Insert the instrument with the cotton ball into the tube from above, pressing it onto the tonsil. Repeat this process as needed until you achieve the desired cauterization. Then leave it; within three or four days, it will wither and fall off. If required, you can apply the medication again.
After cauterization, wipe around the tonsil with a cotton ball soaked in lard and dry the surrounding area. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with compresses and internally with gargles until healing occurs. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and eliminates fear.
The pharyx may also be treated with a more delicate method than cauterization and incision, using fumes. The ingredients include fennel, thyme, sage, mugwort, chamomile, sweet marjoram, and similar herbs. They are mixed in a vessel, all together or some of them, and immersed in vinegar.
The mixture is boiled in a pot lined with wax, and in the lid of the pot there should be a hole through which the hollow instrument is placed, made of silver or brass.
The end of the instrument, containing the gum, is inserted into the patient's mouth, allowing the vapor to reach the pharyx through the tube until the pharyx is satisfied and relaxed. This process should be repeated several times until the swelling subsides, but avoid attempting this treatment at the onset of the tumor.
If the swelling increases, it is important to be patient and wait until the hot tumor subsides. If you do not have the hollow instrument, take a tube and attach a slice of egg shell to its end to avoid burning the patient's mouth.
Because the egg shell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, this is a good treatment that ensures safety.
Chapter Thirty-Eight
In the removal of thorns and other objects lodged in the throat.
Often, a bone, fish hook, or other object will become lodged in the throat. One should remove whatever is visible after pressing the tongue with an instrument at the base of the tongue.
To determine what is in the throat, and if something is hidden and not visible, one should induce vomiting before the patient's food is digested in their stomach. Perhaps the lodged object will be expelled through vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of lint or a small piece of fabric.
Or, they might swallow a dry cracker or take a piece of soft seaweed, tie it to a thread, and make the patient swallow it. When it reaches the location of the hook, quickly tug on the thread, doing this several times.
Often, the hook or bone becomes stuck and can be removed by these methods. If it does not come out as mentioned above, use an instrument made of lead in the shape depicted here.
It should be slightly thicker than a rod and have a curved end that the patient inserts into their throat gently while lifting their head, taking care not to touch their throat to avoid coughing. The doctor can also use their hand to insert it.
The insertion of the sick person is better for his knowledge of the location of the embedded object, and it drives it downwards or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all of this to the extent that it becomes possible until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
In the removal of a lodged thorn from the throat.
If the treatment of the lodged thorn with the mentioned remedies does not work, then look at the patient's throat in the sunlight after pressing their tongue with the instrument described to you.
If you spot the thorn, grab it with a small hook or a delicate, firm forceps. If that is not possible, take an evacuated tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the thorn, and then insert a heated, protected metal rod into the tube.
Do this several times, and have the patient refrain from drinking water for the entire day. Then, have them take a glass filled with cold water, open their mouth, swish it around, not swallow any of it, and occasionally move the water around with their hand.
If the thorn feels the water and falls from its position, as it does when treated with the mentioned remedies, if it still does not come out, then boil the throat with urine and myrrh using the instrument described for inhaling (aromatherapy). Do this several times, and it will fall.
The Method of Using the Incenser: Take a vessel with hot coals from the fire, covered with a lid, with a small hole in the center. Insert the tip of the instrument through this hole and place the incense inside. Have the patient place their mouth over the end of the tube and close it to prevent the incense from escaping, until they know that the incense has reached their ring.
If the phlegm does not come out, the incense should be repeated several times, and the patient should endure thirst, eat salt and garlic, but not drink water; in this way, it will necessarily come out through this treatment, and here is a picture of an instrument that attracts the phlegm from the throat when it falls under the eye.
It resembles a claw, as you can see, except for this bend that enters the throat. Both ends have a roughness similar to a bird's beak; if it grasps something, it does not let go.
Another instrument compresses the tongue, which is a wide ring of iron, large enough to fit over the mouth and rest on the side of the tongue. It keeps the mouth open against the patient's will, and they cannot remove it at all until it is shifted aside.
The instrument that opens the mouth, precisely as described: a metal ring of specific size, designed to fit over the mouth and rest against the tongue's side, keeping the mouth firmly open.
Chapter Forty.
On the discussion of the speech regarding the formation of tumors and their incision.
The types of tumors are numerous and varied, as mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their shell and incision from two aspects: one is the type of tumor itself and what it contains of moistures.
The second type differs by the locations where they occur in the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as one occurring in the hip, and a tumor occurring in a hot spot is not the same as one occurring in a joint, each having its own rules regarding treatment.
Some tumors should not be incised until the pus within them has matured and reached its fullness, while others should be incised immediately, such as those close to joints that have not yet fully formed.
Because when a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it putrefies what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerve of that joint, causing paralysis of that member or when the tumor is close to a vital organ.
If you delay the incision until the pus matures, it will harm that vital member or, if located near the hip, it will cause a fistula when incised after maturation, leading to putrefaction and spreading inside the hip. Therefore, one must not delay incising a tumor that has not yet fully matured, even if located near the hip, for fear of it becoming a fistula.
In some cases, the condition may not heal completely, and one must know when the tumors have reached their full maturity, which occurs when the pain subsides, fever disappears, redness and pulsation diminish, the tumor's head becomes firm, and other signs disappear.
If possible, the ulcer should be placed at the lowest point of the tumor to facilitate the flow of discharge downward, or in the thinnest part of the tumor with the most distinct contour, and if the tumors are located near the hands and feet, the ulcer should extend along the length of the body.
The ulcer should also be placed in the positions of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all flat areas with no bends. If the tumor is located in bony areas, it is better to leave the ulcer intact.
So that it may fully mature as we have mentioned, if you ulcerate it before, the discharge of pus will be prolonged and cause much harm and dirtiness, and sometimes the ulcer's edges may harden and its depths may become clogged. Some tumors may be ulcerated across the width of the body if necessary or according to what the organ requires.
For small tumors, a single ulcer should be used, while for large tumors, a wide ulcer or multiple cracks should be made according to the tumor's size. Some tumors may require the skin to be cut and peeled if they have become like a cloth.
And it became, in a manner, as if it were dead, as is often the case in many abscesses and pustules, some of which are incised with three angles, and others have a portion cut from them resembling the shape of a laurel leaf.
And some use a round incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and other cuts, and if the tumor has no head, like a smooth, flat mass, it should be incised simply, and if the tumor is large and has accumulated pus for a long time, one should not hurry to remove all the pus at once.
Instead, remove some of it and then compress the tumor until another day, then remove some more pus, doing this gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for often the animal spirit dissolves with the discharge of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it, so be extremely careful in this matter.
After incising these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it. If the incision of the tumor is small or the cut simple, use old linen or cotton thread. If the tumor is large and the incisions numerous, ...
Then, you should insert a thread in each cut until they connect, and if the tumor has detached some skin or formed a cavity, it should be filled with old cotton or linen beard, without moisture, and secured until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a cotton cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding persists, you should employ the measures, treatments, and applications described in many places within this book and according to its divisions. If it is winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, then soak the bandages in a hot drink and oil.
Place it on the area, and if it is summer and the conditions are hot, then soak the bandages in cold water and oil or a cold drink and oil. As mentioned earlier, you should leave it for three days and then remove the tumor and clean it.
Use what resembles it for treatment until it heals. This is all the knowledge needed to treat tumors in general, and as for the detailed method, each tumor has been described with a summary of its treatment.
Chapter Forty-One.
On the incision of tumors that occur on the scalp skin.
There are small tumors on the scalp skin, which belong to a category of growths enclosed in membranes and having specific conditions similar to a hen's egg. There are many types, some are fatty, and others contain moisture like mud.
Some (tissues) contain moisture similar to cotton or soup, and others are hardened and solid. All of these pose no danger in terms of incising and extracting them, unless a vessel (i.e., a blood vessel) is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incising (tissue) involves first probing it with the instrument depicted below, which is called a 'meds', to determine what it contains. If it contains moisture, make a longitudinal incision along this line, a simple cut as shown.
Begin the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. If the moisture evacuates, peel and completely remove the sac that contained it, leaving no part of it untouched, for it often returns if any remains.
Then, soak a cotton ball in pure ointment if available, or in saline water if not, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, as it will consume what remains of the sac. Reapply the cotton ball with ointment to the wound a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing remains of the sac, continue treating the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains a fatty substance, incise it as shown.
Make a cross-cut and break the stitching across the wound edges, then peel it from all sides. Strive to remove the pericarp that contains it, for if a vessel blocks your way, proceed as described, and do the same with the tumor if it is hardened from the cut.
The treatment is the same as mentioned, and the cut on a hardened tumor is easier because it contains less blood and moisture, and some of these tumors in the head may have no moisture at all, as I once cut a tumor in...
On the head of an old woman, I found a tumor as hard as a solid stone, rough and white, which could not be broken even if someone threw it against something, and these tumors are different from the rest that occur on the head, like those that appear in children's heads.
At the base of the ears, make a simple cut through them all and turn their flaps downward to facilitate the flow of the contents downwards, then treat them as appropriate.
Chapter Forty-Two
In the cut on pigs, tumors often occur in the neck, under the arms, and in the groin, and they can appear anywhere on the body. Some may be single, while others are numerous and some grow from one another.
And each of these pigs is within a special peritoneum, as in goods and tumors of the head, as we have described; and there are many types of these pigs, some are hard, some contain humors, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
And as for what I have seen of them that is good upon touching, and its appearance is close to the color of skin, moving in every direction, not attached to the neck nerve or vein or artery, nor sunken. Then it should be incised with a simple cut from above to below the body, in this manner, following the line from ~J~ to ~B~: .
And peel it from every side, stretching the skin lips with a hook or two or many hooks, if necessary, as we have said in tumors of the head; and take them out little by little, and they should be on the neck without cutting any vein or nerve, and let the knife be not too sharp.
So that your hand does not make additional cuts or disturb the patient, cutting what is not needed to be cut; if you cut a vein or artery and it hinders your work, put into the wound either powdered glass or some small stones that stop the blood.
Bind the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to fester; then the blood will stop at that time, so return to your work until you are finished, then check with your thumb if any remain, then cut off and clean the remaining small pigs.
If there is a large vein in the original pig, it should not be cut from its origin but tied with a double thread tightly and left until it falls by itself without harm. Then the wound should be filled with old cotton, soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treated.
If the pig is completely cut off, one should gather the edges of the wound and sew it up immediately after realizing that no tissue remains, especially if there is any remnant of the pig's bone.
One should aim for a complete cut through the pig's root and foundation, using sewing as mentioned, and for pigs containing moisture, apply a simple bandage where you identify the area of its maturity, positioning the bandage below as previously explained.
Then, apply Egyptian ointment and similar substances over the bandage to consume any remaining corruption. Once you observe the wound has healed, treat it with flesh-regenerating ointments until it is completely cured.
Chapter 34.
In the incision of the throat, revealing a tumor within the pharynx.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not witnessed anyone perform it in our country, and this is their manner of speech. As for those with strangulation, they should avoid this throat incision, as it is useless.
In order that all the veins and lung may be healed, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the trachea, then the incision of the throat must be used to avoid the damage that results from suffocation.
If we wish to do this, we should make an incision in the throat beneath three circles of the trachea or four small vertical incisions between two circles, as deep as the incision is in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location corresponds to the proper place for the incision.
Since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant, if the healer is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a hook and then make an incision in the skin until it reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then, he should make an incision in the peritoneum that we described, and he can determine the trachea's incision by the mucus that comes out of it, along with the coughing and keeping the wound open for a period. Once the time when suffocation was feared passes, the wound edges are closed by pulling the skin together.
He should operate alone, removing the cartilage, and then use medications to promote tissue growth until healing occurs. The author of this book explains that these words refer to when they observe a patient with a blockage in their throat due to one of the tumors mentioned.
And when the patient nears death, they should open a slit in the throat to allow him to breathe on the wound, thus regaining his breath and escaping death. They ordered that the wound remain open until the illness passes, usually within three days or so.
They then commanded that the wound be stitched and treated until it heals. I have personally witnessed a servant taking a knife and cutting into her throat, severing part of her lung, and she was brought to me for treatment; I found her gasping for breath as if she were being slaughtered. I examined the wound.
I found that the blood flowing from the wound was thin, indicating that no major vessels or nerves had been cut; air could also escape from the wound. So I cleaned and treated it until it healed, with the servant experiencing only a slight change in voice.
After several days, she recovered fully, demonstrating that opening the throat does not pose any danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision made into the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside and is known as the pharyngeal fistula.
This tumor, known as the pharyngeal fistula, is a large growth that resembles the body's own flesh and is common in women. It comes in two types.
It is either natural or accidental. The natural one offers no recourse, while the accidental comes in two forms: one resembling fatty tissue and the other a tumor resulting from the complexing of an artery, which poses a risk upon incision. Therefore, one should not attempt to treat it with iron at all, unless it is a small amount that, after probing and examining it with a probe, you find it resembles fatty tissue and is not attached to any blood vessels, then you can cut it as you would with fat. And remove it along with the sac if it is in a sac, otherwise, thoroughly investigate all of it and then treat the site as necessary.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the types of incisions on various tissues.
The tissues have many types, and all of them have been mentioned in the classification. Here, it is necessary to explain the difference between tissue and abscess, as it is a complex matter. I say that an abscess presents with heat, fever, and severe pain until the inflammation of the pus subsides. The development of the mold completes the resolution of fever and its intensity, and with it, there is no heat, no fever, nor pain. It envelops a sac-like membrane that serves as its specific container, appearing in the color of the body. Its initial form resembles a chestnut, and it becomes like a bladder, larger or smaller.
These are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture vary as mentioned in the classification. When treating this condition, it is necessary to examine and inspect it first with a tool called a probe, as shown in the image in the door following this one.
Assess the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and observe what emerges. If it is a flow of liquid moisture, regardless of color, make a simple cut as mentioned for other tumors. If no moisture emerges after probing, know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped cut on it as shown, and suspend it with pincers. Gently peel the skin from all sides, and preserve the sac if you can extract it intact along with the tumor.
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you are unable to extract it intact, be careful, as this often happens. Remove it piece by piece until none remains, for if any part persists, whether small or large, the condition may recur.
If you are overcome and a small amount remains, tear it with some sharp, edible particles and tighten the wound, then place something to soothe the hot swelling on top and treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If the wound is large, outline its edges and treat it with what seals.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and blood loss occurs, immediately tear the area with powdered ash and leave it tightened for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the blood fever subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the vein.
Chapter LXIV
In the images of instruments.
Which operate on the wound and its cavities, images of the probes: there are three types of them, large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe:
Image of a medium probe:
Image of a small probe:
It is made of steel with square ends, tightly forged to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of the probes, called blades, and there are three types as well: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:
Image of a Surgical Probe in the Middle:
Image of a Small Probe:
Suitable for examining tumours, wounds, and foreign bodies, it searches for what is inside, such as bones or other objects. It is made round, smooth, and polished, like a rod made of brass from China or Spain, or bronze, iron, or silver. The best material is Spanish bronze.
Probes can also be made from black lead and are used to penetrate narrow spaces where there is a bend, allowing them to follow the curve with flexibility. They come in three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the depth required for each narrow space, and by adjusting its thickness to match the size and narrowness of the space, Image of a large lead probe:
Image of a medium lead probe:
Image of a small lead probe:
Images of forceps, with many varieties: They are three types, including forceps with three claws, and they come in three varieties. All these types require their respective places; a simple large forceps: [image] [Image of a simple medium-sized forceps] [Image of a simple small-sized forceps]
[Image of a large blind forceps] [Image of a medium blind forceps]
[Image of a small blind forceps]
[Image of a large forceps with two claws] [Image of a medium forceps with two claws] [Image of a small forceps with two claws]
[Image of a large forceps with three claws]
[Image of a medium forceps with three claws] Image of a small hook with three barbs:
And here are images of knives used to cut and scrape the body, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large knife:
Image of a medium knife:
Image of a small knife:
The blades used for cutting are limited in number, while the other parts are versatile. They are designed to assist in scraping the body when there is a risk of cutting a vein or nerve, and to provide comfort to the patient, offering some relief from the discomfort caused by removing the tumor.
And here are images of poultices, which come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large poultice:
It is made of a semi-soft copper that is used for scraping and on one end, it resembles a broad spoon with two layers. At the head, there is a hidden blade of the scalpel, resembling a bird's tongue, which can be extended inward and outward as desired.
Images of knives that hide between the fingers when cutting through tumors are not felt by the patient, and they come in three types because some are large, others medium, and still others small. An image of a large knife:
Images of scalpels used to cut through blood clots, which come in three types because some are large, others medium, and still others small. An image of a large scalpel:
These scalpels are made of copper or rounded steel slightly longer as you can see, and they should be both large and small in your possession. These types of knives are to cut through blood quickly when necessary, and when no medicine is available.
However, they should not be used to cut through blood at every part of the body, but rather in muscular areas such as the thigh, calf, arm, breast, abdomen, and groin, and other similar fatty parts.
And from it, other small tools can be made that resemble pistachio shells, as illustrated here:
It can be used to stop blood flow if it is bleeding from a phlebotomy site or when cutting a vein or artery, and it can be made round, as illustrated here:
Chapter 47
In the treatment of male mammary (breast) conditions.
Which, resembling the female mammary gland, may become swollen in some people upon reaching puberty, making it resemble a woman's breast and causing an unsightly lump, those who dislike this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast as illustrated here.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~: Then, remove all the fat and fill the wound with a healing salve, then sew together the edges of the wound, and treat it until it heals. If the breast tilts downward and relaxes due to its bone structure, as is the case with women.
Then, make two crescent-shaped incisions on its upper sides that connect at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one as illustrated here: From line ~B~ to line ~C~ then the skin between the two cuts is scraped, the fat is removed, and one employs the stitching and bandages we have mentioned, along with whatever treatment is required until healing occurs.
If you are unable to remove the pieces that need to be cut for the patient's safety or due to blood loss, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a consumable ointment and leave it until the remaining fat is consumed, then treat it until healing occurs.
Chapter Eighty-Four
In the case of tumors that occur under the arm.
These tumors that occur under the arm are of the type known as "pigs," which are solid and contained within a sac. Some may contain fluids. In such cases, they should be incised in an crescent-shaped cut along this shape.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~, if you have drained all the contents from the tumor using cotton waste, leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until healing occurs. If the tumor is of the type known as "pigs," incise it as we mentioned for the pigs, whether the wound progresses to the point of pus formation; in such cases, apply cauterization as we described previously.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
In the incision of the tumor that is exposed by an artery or vein, called aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, such a condition often leads to a tumor, and similarly, a vein may also develop a puffy, swollen lump.
The signs by which it is known whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is usually rectangular and located deeply in the body; when you press the tumor with your finger, you can feel a crackling sensation.
The one that is from a vein will present as a round tumor on the surface of the body; the incision on these tumors is dangerous, especially those located in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places on the body, and they can be very large, so it is advisable to avoid treating them with iron.
And for those located in the limbs or head, it is advisable to avoid them; if it is a swelling of an artery, make an incision along its length in the skin, then open the wound with forceps, remove the artery, and free it from adhesions.
Until it is exposed, then insert an needle under it and push it through to the other side, tieing the artery with a doubled thread at two points, as I have previously explained regarding the arteries in the neck; then use a scalpel to punch the area between the bands until all the blood flows out.
The tumor resolves, after which the treatment that produces pus is employed until the bands (or ligaments) fall off, then it is treated with appropriate ointments until healing occurs.
If the tumor is in front of a vein, you should hold the tumor with your hand along with the skin, then insert an needle below the site where you are holding and pass it through while containing a doubled thread until you exit from the other side. Then, tie the tumor securely as mentioned to you, by tying both sides of the thread to the ends of the tumor, if you are afraid that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with a new thread under the entire tumor at the point where the first needle intersects.
Pull the threads in four places, then make an incision in the middle of the tumor until its contents are expelled, cut off any excess skin and leave what was attached to it. Then apply a bandage that has been soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then employ the treatment involving winding and ointments until healing occurs.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that is exposed due to nerve twisting.
As the tumor appears in the artery and vein, so it appears in the nerve if it is struck or occurs due to excessive fatigue or similar, and most often in the wrists and ankles.
In every location where the joints move, there is a firm tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body. Most often, it does not cause pain, and if pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation similar to numbness. The tumor is not localized deep within the body.
Instead, it is located under the skin and moves in all directions, neither advancing nor retreating. As for what is found in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, as it may cause damage. And as for what is found in the head or forehead, it should not be treated in the same manner.
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, use a pincers to remove it from the root; if large, hang it on a hook and peel it off, then remove it entirely and close the wound with stitches until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
On the excision of warts appearing on the abdomen.
They may appear frequently on some people's abdomens and other parts of their bodies, known as warts (fungi) due to their resemblance to mushrooms. Their root is thin, while their head is thick. Sometimes their edges turn inward, and they can vary in size, from very small to extremely large.
And I have seen a man with two polyps in his abdomen, similar to mushrooms, without any difference; their white, delicate bases had twisted and split apart, and moisture was always seeping from them. So I cut them off, and weighed one at about eighteen ounces and the other at approximately six ounces.
And the procedure for cutting them is to observe: if the patient is moist and the polyp is white, wet, and of delicate origin, then cut it with a wide scalpel. Be prepared with hot iron, as cutting them often causes a great deal of bleeding.
If you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it; if the patient is timid and afraid of having iron cut into them, take a tight leaden thread and bind it around the polyp, leaving it for two days, then increasing the tension on the lead daily until the thread is tightly bound.
As often as it affects the polyp until it detaches and falls out on its own, without any assistance; if the polyp is thick in origin, cutting it does carry some fear and risk, especially when it is inside the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut off half or part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return; then treat the wound until it heals. Be careful not to cut a polyp that is pale in color, lacking sensation, and unappealing in appearance, as it may be a cancerous tumor, which we will mention later.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of navel hernia.
A navel hernia may result from various causes, either a tear in the peritoneum that allows the omentum or intestines to protrude, as is the case with other hernias, or from blood originating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or from trapped gas.
If the hernia is caused by a tear in the peritoneum allowing the omentum to protrude, it will appear as a tumor-like mass similar in color to the body's flesh, soft to the touch, without pain, and easily movable. If the hernia is caused by the protrusion of the intestines, its appearance will be significantly different from what we described earlier. Pressing it with your fingers may cause it to disappear then reappear, and it may emit gurgling sounds. It often becomes more pronounced during bowel movements and intense exertion. If it is due to fluid accumulation, it will be soft.
It will not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor will its size increase or decrease. If caused by blood, the tumor will appear black, and if due to a growing tissue, it will be spongy, solid, and maintain a consistent size.
If the cause is gas, it will be soft to the touch. In this case, you should refrain from treating it, as there is risk and uncertainty, as explained in the chapter on tumors caused by arteries and veins.
If the navel hernia protrudes from the intestines or fat, you should order the patient to hold himself and stand upright, then trace around the navel with a pen. Then, you should order the patient to lie down on his back between your hands, and with a wide knife, cut around the navel at the marked point. Then, using a large forceps, pull the middle of the hernia upward, and tightly tie off the incision with a strong thread or silk thread.
The knot should be a simple loop. Then, open the hernia wall above the knot and insert your index finger. If you find intestines, relax the knot and push them back into the abdomen. If you find fat, use the forceps to stretch it.
Cut off any excess, and if you encounter an artery or vein, tightly tie it off. Return to your task, take two needles, insert them into the cut at right angles, and pull, tightening the hernia in four places around the needles.
Alternatively, you may remove the needles and leave the site to heal on its own until the flesh shrinks and falls off or is cut away if it softens and decays. Then, treat the area with appropriate ointments for healing, especially if the navel hernia involved tissue growth.
If there is moisture, it should be incised as we have said and the blood or moisture found therein then drained, after which the wound should be treated with what seals the place.
Chapter LXXV.
In the treatment of cancer.
As we have mentioned in the classification, there are types of cancer, and the way to treat it with drugs, while cautioning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We also discussed cancer that develops in the womb and cautioned against its treatment.
The ancients stated that if cancer is in a place that can have it all removed, such as breast or thigh cancer, or other members capable of removal, it should be done particularly if it is in its early stages and small. However, if it has progressed and become large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to heal anyone, and I have not seen anyone before me reach that level. If it is possible, as we said, then you should advance and ease the patient from the black plague in multiples, but if it is in the veins with obvious congestion, you should avoid it.
Then, position the patient in a way that allows for treatment and insert into the cancer the tools suitable for it. Incise it from all sides with the skin, thoroughly, until there is nothing left of its roots. Let the blood flow without cutting it off quickly.
Squeeze the site and express all the thick blood with your hand or as much as possible with instruments. If it obstructs your work, great loss of blood will result from cutting an artery or vein, so squeeze (the wound) until the blood stops, then treat it with all other remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the treatment of hernia.
We have previously discussed the types of ascites, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and their treatments with medications. The type treated with iron is solely the edematous type, and it should not be approached with iron for the thin (tissue) or fatty types under any circumstances.
If this approach is deadly, and your treatment of the edematous type of hernia with medications does not work, then consider whether the patient has reached extreme weakness or suffers from another condition, such as a different type of hernia or other diseases.
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar symptoms, do not treat them with iron; it is risky. If you examine the patient and they are strong, without any other disease besides hernia, and are neither a child nor an elderly person, then the course of action is to have the patient stand between your hands. A servant behind him squeezes his belly with his hands and pushes the water downward towards the groin, then takes a surgical knife in this manner:
A long, curved instrument with defined ends, similar to a knife, but with a slight concavity at the tip to prevent it from penetrating into the intestines during surgery, which could cause harm. Observe if hernia has formed from the side of the intestines.
The incision should be made three fingers below the navel, following the direction towards the groin. If the hernia is due to liver disease, make the incision on the left side of the navel, three fingers long; if it is caused by spleen disease, make the incision on the right side, also three fingers long.
The incision should not be made on the side that the patient prefers to lie on, as this could cause excess drainage to that weak area. Then, with the instrument, puncture the skin completely and insert it into the incision, lifting your hand.
Using the surgical knife, make an incision between the skin and the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, removing a quantity roughly the size of a fingernail or similar. Then, puncture the peritoneum until the knife reaches a hollow space (the site of the hernia), extract the knife, and insert the instrument into the hole in its place.
It is a semi-cylindrical tube made of a thin cane crafted from silver, copper, or smooth, polished bronze, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on each side, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And one end may be sharpened to resemble the shape of the tip of a pen, like this: .
At the upper end, there is a ring; when the instrument reaches the water, it descends on the machine and empties the water at a moderate rate, for if you empty more than necessary in that time, the patient might die due to the dissolution of his animal spirit.
or it may cause a condition close to death, but you should evacuate it according to his strength and the signs of the patient's pulse and good color, then remove the instrument and stop the water, as it is retained from that time.
due to the skin that covers the hole in the peritoneum, which I told you to secure in that manner, and then reinsert the instrument another day if you see the patient capable of it.
It also releases a small amount of water over several days, always checking and avoiding any errors so that there is only a tiny remainder. If you are concerned for the patient and left a significant amount of water, treat it by burial in hot sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath or in the sun, endure the thirst, and treat it with drying medications until recovery. Apply heat to the stomach, liver, and spleen after evacuating the body of water as described previously.
Chapter LXV
In the treatment of children born with unpierced or narrow or mispositioned urethral openings.
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an unpierced perineum, and it is necessary to promptly perforate it upon birth.
With a very fine scalpel, as shown in the image.
Then, insert a very thin lead wire through the perforation, tie and secure it for three or four days. When the patient feels the urge to urinate, gently remove the plug. If you do not use lead, the urine flow could prevent the opening from closing.
As for those with a narrow opening, they are treated with lead as mentioned for numerous days until it widens, and some have the opening in the wrong position, such that they are born with it at the end of the perineum, preventing them from urinating frontward.
Until the urethra is lifted above by hand, and the semen is unable to reach the uterus directly, it is a very unpleasant condition. The procedure involves having the patient lie on their back.
Then, extend his penis with your left hand firmly and use a blade or a sharp knife, as if carving, to cut the head of the urethra. The cut should be in the middle, forming a tube-like shape, and the hole should be positioned as required.
Be cautious during the procedure to avoid bleeding, as it often occurs. Counteract it by applying measures to stop the blood flow and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 65.
In the condition affecting the foreskin, the glans, the prepuce, and leading to decay and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This condition often affects the urethra, appearing as a smoldering ulcer. It can be either malignant or benign. For the non-malignant variety, it is advisable to attach it with a delicate hook.
Cut it until it is entirely cleansed, then apply a cotton ball dipped in Egyptian ointment. Subsequently, treat the area with Nubian ointment until healing occurs. However, if the ulcer is malignant and discolored, cauterize it after cutting and cleaning, and use this method for best results.
If the abscess is in the foreskin, it should be treated without circumcision. If some of the abscesses are inside the foreskin and some outside, it is necessary to remove the abscesses that are inside first, so that when they heal, you can then treat the ones outside.
Because if you treat them together, the foreskin may tear, and it can also turn black and corrupt in females and the foreskin, so you should cut off all that has turned black, whether it is about to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sieved pomegranate rind and fennel, and treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a curved iron to cauterize it in the following manner:
In both cases, cauterization is beneficial: when blood is lost and in the case of a foul-smelling wound. If the abscess ruptures completely at any point, you should insert a lead tube into the urethra to help the sick person urinate. For the adherence of the foreskin to the abscess, use cauterization as well.
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and does not require circumcision. It can also be caused by a wound or tumor, so you should use a blunted scalpel to remove it, freeing the foreskin from all sides.
If the tumor is difficult to distinguish through examination, it should be skinned from the femoral head and foreskin. The foreskin is thin, so it may puncture quickly due to its thinness, then separate the foreskin from the femoral head with a thin cotton cloth that has been wetted with cold water to prevent adhesion as well.
Then treat it with an astringent solution until it heals.
Chapter LXXVII.
On purifying boys and treating what befalls them of errors.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of connection, like any other surgery, except that since it is something we do on purpose and is specifically done in boys, we must outline the best practice for it.
The easiest path to safety is this: the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws, but rather, it is something we have acquired.
By experience, I found that the majority of practitioners and surgeons use a knife or scissors for purification, and they also employ calking, binding with thread, and cutting with nails—I have tried all these methods.
I have found no better method than cleansing with a scalpel and binding with thread, for the use of the scalpel often damages the skin because the skin of the prepuce has two layers, and it is possible that the upper layer may be cut while the lower layer remains intact.
He is then forced to make another cut and endure renewed pain, as cleansing with a flame does not ensure the complete removal of the foreskin, as it may enter its hole, and cleansing with a nail might loosen the skin or spoil your work or, if the boy's foreskin is naturally short.
Often, they are born in such a condition that no cleansing is required, and I have witnessed this. The method of cleansing with a scalpel and binding with thread has proven superior to me through experience, as the cutting edge of the scalpel is identical to the lower blade.
When you press your hand to bring the two blades into alignment, they cut with one measure and at the same time, making the thread fasten around the foreskin's skin from all sides, preventing any mistake whatsoever, and the primary consideration is to make the boy comfortable.
In particular, if it is someone who slightly understands that you only tie the thread around his urethra and leave it for another day, then delight and please him in every way possible while ensuring he accepts this with his mind, and then have him stand upright between your hands.
Do not have the surgeon sit with the scissors hidden in their sleeve or under their foot, ensuring the apprentice's eyes do not fall upon them or any of the tools. Then, insert your hand into the urethra and blow on the skin, lifting it upwards to expose the head of the urethra.
Then, clean it of any dirt, tie the marked place with a doubled thread, and a second tie slightly below. Hold the lower tie firmly with your index finger and middle finger, then cut between the two ties. Then, quickly lift the skin upwards to expose the head of the urethra, allowing a little blood to flow, which is beneficial and helps reduce swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth and sprinkle it with dried, burned pumpkin ash, or fine ground peppercorns, both of which are excellent.
Then, quickly lift the skin upwards to expose the head of the urethra, allowing a little blood to flow, which is beneficial and helps reduce swelling. Then, dry it with a damp cloth and sprinkle it with dried, burned pumpkin ash, or fine ground peppercorns, both of which are excellent. Then, place a slice of boiled egg mixed with rosewater and fat from fresh roses on the wound, leaving it for another day. After that, treat it with all the usual remedies until it heals.
And this is an image of the scissors suitable for cleansing:
It should be a sharp, straight scissor with handles of equal length. If there is any error in cleansing, the skin might roll up or part of it may detach upon cutting; therefore, before applying pressure, use your fingernail to straighten the area from your watch.
If you cannot cut it evenly with your fingernail, use a hook and pull it out, then cut it off. If after three days the swelling and warmth beneath the head of the urethra persist, leave it until the hot edema subsides, then peel it gently.
Cut it as you see fit, but be careful around the head of the urethra. If you cut off a part of the head of the urethra, it will not cause harm. Treat it with the cauterization techniques described in the section on cauterization.
If the skin above the urethra is cut and shrinks upwards, it will not cause significant harm. Treat it as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter LXXVIII
In the treatment of urinary retention in the bladder.
Urinary retention in the bladder occurs due to a blockage caused by a stone, congealed blood, pus, or flesh growth, among other things. Treat it with the various remedies described in the sections mentioned in the categorization.
If urine cannot be released and you notice that the retention is due to a stone that has damaged the bladder neck, the patient should kneel with their knees on the ground and lean back. Then, have someone sit on the patient's back while they stretch their abdomen towards their spine and try to expel the urine as much as possible.
When the bladder's neck is forced to push the stone backward, urine flows. If it does not flow as mentioned and the patient's condition worsens, a device called a catheter should be used, which has this shape: .
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, and hollow like a feather tube, approximately one and a half inches long. It has a gentle cone at its tip, and to use it for urination, take a folded string and securely tie a woolen or cotton ball to the end.
Insert the string's end into the catheter's base and cut it with scissors if necessary to ensure it fits inside the tube like a plug. Then, grease the catheter with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
The bladder and urethra are then lubricated with wet oils or oil and warm water, and the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches its origin. The urethra is then bent upwards towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed further inside.
Until the urethra is bent and the catheter is pushed further, reaching close to the perineum, the penis is tilted downwards, and the catheter remains inside. Then, it is inserted into the bladder, and the patient feels that something empty has been reached.
It is prepared in this manner because the passage through which urine flows is curved, and then the thread is stretched with a slight tension along with the wool, causing the urine to follow the thread and exit, allowing the catheter to be withdrawn.
Continue this process until the bladder is empty, providing relief to the patient.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to Inject the Bladder with Medicinal Liquids.
And images of the tools suitable for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory with a long tube of delicate material attached. These tubes are used to slowly drip water and medicines, utilizing a device known as a 'zarrāqah', whose image is depicted here.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, this device features a long tube with a delicate, hollow interior, save for a solid end at one side that contains three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as illustrated.
The hollow space, containing the tubes, should be precisely sized to allow for efficient flow without excess. When drawn upon, it attracts moisture, and when pushed, it forces out liquids, much like a squirt gun used in naval warfare.
If you wish to expel moistures from the bladder, insert the end of the catheter into the moisture and draw it upwards with the syringe; then the moisture will be attracted into the lumen of the catheter, after which its end is inserted into the urethra, as we described in the section on catheters, and then push out the moisture with the syringe.
Then this moisture reaches the bladder to the extent that the patient feels it, and here is a picture of a delicate syringe that is also used to inject the bladder.
It is made of silver or ceramic, with its upper end resembling a small funnel and a groove underneath where the strap is placed; then take a camel's bladder and put in it the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder, then tightly tie it between the grooves with a doubled thread.
And warm up that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the end of the syringe into the urethra, and tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture firmly so that the patient feels that this moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin cloth and make a circle from it, perforate it all around, then insert a tight thread into these holes as you twist it; gather the circle as you would a handkerchief after placing what you want of moistures, oils, and waters inside.
Then bind it to the instrument and use it as you used the bladder, with your hand at each epoch until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty
On the Extraction of Stones
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the distinction between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, along with their respective symptoms. We also mentioned the stone that requires manual intervention or incision.
The stone formed in the bladder, particularly those that become lodged in the urethra, is what I am describing in detail and succinctly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder are most common in young boys, and among their symptoms, urine exits the bladder as if it were water due to its softness.
It presents with sand, causing irritation and manipulation of the penis; often, it hangs loosely. In many cases, the anus also becomes involved, making recovery easier for young children until they reach the age of 14, but more difficult for older individuals. For adolescent males, the condition is typically moderate in severity between the ages of 10 and 30.
The treatment is easier for those with larger stones, and more difficult for those with smaller ones. When resorting to treatment, it is first necessary to inject the patient with a solution that expels all feces from their intestines, as this may prevent the stone from being detected during examination.
Then the patient is taken by the feet, shaken and tilted downward to make the stone descend to the base of the bladder, or he may be made to jump from a high place several times. Then he is seated between your hands with his back straight and his hands under his thighs, so that the bladder tilts completely downward, and then it is examined.
Feel it from the outside, if you sense the stone in the space, immediately use your scalpel to cut it. If it does not fall under your touch, you should smear your index finger (or middle finger for a boy) with oil from your left hand.
If it is a fully grown boy, insert your finger into his anus and search for the stone until it is under your finger. Then, slowly move it to the base of the bladder, then press and push it gently towards the opening you want to cut.
Order a servant to squeeze the bladder with their hand, and another to extend both female genitals upwards with one hand and stretch the skin underneath towards the position where the cut will be made. Then take the scalpel as shown in the image.
Making an incision between the rectum and vulva, not directly in the middle but to the side of the left pelvis, with the knife and your finger on the same line as the stone in the rectum while pressing it outward in a curved manner so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, allowing for the stone's extraction as much as possible.
If you press the finger in the rectum during the incision, it may force the stone out without difficulty, but be aware that some stones have angles and corners, making their extraction more difficult.
Some stones are smooth and rounded, making them easy to extract, while others have angles and edges, requiring a slight enlargement of the incision. If they still do not come out, one should use a firm grip, with a tool resembling a file at the end, to grasp and pull them out.
To secure the stone, do not let it slip, and if a delicate, curved tool cannot be inserted under it, slightly widen the incision. If blood is encountered, cut it away with zagg (a type of material or instrument).
If there are multiple stones, first dislodge the larger one into the bladder, then make an incision on it, and subsequently push out smaller ones. If a stone is extremely large, it is ignorant to make a large incision on it, as it may expose the patient to either of two dangers.
Either he dies or permanent dribbling of urine occurs, because the wound never heals. Try to force it out or use a bone hook to break and extract it completely.
After completing the procedure, dress the deep wound with a poultice of oil, elixir, or rose fat and cold water to soothe the hot swelling. Then, have the patient lie on their back without loosening the bandage until the third day.
If the wound heals, clean it with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with nettle paste and basil paste until it recovers. If a hot, swollen tumor develops along with pain, difficulty urinating, or blood in the urine (indicating a clot in the bladder), seek immediate treatment.
Insert your finger into the wound to remove any remaining blood clots, as they can lead to bladder damage and infection. Then, clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, applying appropriate treatments for each condition until it heals.
Throughout the treatment process, secure the patient's thighs together to help contain the applied treatments and ensure their effectiveness. If a small stone is trapped in the urethra, causing blockage and preventing urination, treat it as described above before it advances further.
Often, this treatment replaces the need for incision. I have tried it, taking a claw made of steel, as illustrated here.
A triangular-shaped tip, sharp and pointed, is inserted into a stick. Then, take a thread and tie it to the rod beneath the stone to prevent its return to the bladder. Afterwards, insert the claw into the urethra gently until the claw reaches the same stone.
Turn the claw with your hand in the same stone little by little, aiming to pierce it. Once through, from the other side, urine will flow freely. Then, grasp what remains of the stone outside the rod; it will break and exit with the urine, healing the patient.
If this treatment is not feasible due to a hindering factor, tie a thread under the stone and another above it. Then, make an incision on the stone along the rod between the two threads and remove it.
Then, untie the thread and clean the dried blood in the wound. The thread was tied under the stone to prevent its return to the bladder, and the other thread above it is for when, after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place, covering the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin above to return and cover the wound once the stone is removed, as we mentioned.
Chapter LXVI.
On the removal of stones in women.
Stones in women are rare, and if one should appear, it is difficult to treat it and impossible for many reasons. One reason is that the woman might be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who allows the physician to examine her.
If she is a virgin or related to the physician, thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this art, especially manual work, fourthly, the location of the incision for the stone is far from the stone itself in women, requiring a deeper cut.
There is danger in this, so if necessary, one should take a skilled female physician, but they are rare; if unavailable, seek a virtuous and friendly doctor or a woman midwife skilled in women's matters or someone who has some knowledge of this art.
Have her prepare and command her to perform all she directs regarding the examination of the stone first. If the woman is a virgin, you should insert your finger into her vagina and check for the stone. If found, press it gently with your finger.
Then she should be commanded to make an incision, but if she is not a virgin, but married (a woman of experience), have the midwife insert her finger into the patient's vagina and check for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it firmly.
If you find it, you should insert it from the bladder mouth down to its full extent until it reaches the origin of the thigh. Then make an incision on it opposite the middle of the vagina at the origin of the thigh, from whichever side it presents itself, and feel for the stone in that area.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it from below; at first make a small cut, then insert the rod into that small cut. If she feels the stone, increase the cut to the extent you know the stone will come out of it. Be aware that there are many types of stones.
They include small and large, smooth and rough, long and round stones, with various shapes. Know their types to be able to identify what you want. If blood prevails, sprinkle the crushed glass in the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
So that the stone comes out, and be mindful to prepare in your mind the tools mentioned for removing stones from men, so they help you in your work. If blood loss prevails and you know it is from a cut artery, place pressure on the wound.
Secure it tightly with bandages and do not touch it, leaving the stone in place. Sometimes the patient may die, so be cautious. After some days, if the blood clotting stops and the area becomes infected, resume your work to remove the stone.
The 62nd Chapter.
In the incision of the seminal vesicle.
The seminal vesicle is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white peritoneum that lies beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testis, known as the scrotum. It may have a distinct membrane allocated to it by nature on one side of the testis.
So it may appear to be another testis, located between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum we mentioned earlier, which only happens rarely. This vesicle is derived from weakness that affects the males, and it may be displaced by a blow to the scrotum.
This moisture may exhibit various colors, ranging from yellow to reddish-brown, or even black and grayish-black, but it is most commonly clear white, and these characteristics serve as its distinguishing marks.
When moisture accumulates, if it is in the white peritoneum as described, the swelling takes on a somewhat elongated, round shape resembling an egg. The testis is not visible since the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is confined to a distinct membrane, the swelling takes on a round shape with one side slightly flattened, resembling an egg.
Therefore, man may think it another egg, although the moisture between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane is under sensation, and if you wish to know the color of the moisture, probe the tumor with a square forceps as shown in the image, and whatever comes out in the wake of the forceps, judge it according to its contents.
If we resort to treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have bloodletting if they are able to do so and you observe their body filled (with blood), then lie down on their back on something slightly elevated, place several layers of cloth underneath, and sit on their left side.
You should order a servant to sit on the patient's right side, extending their penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the direction of the abdomen. Then take a broad scalpel and make a longitudinal incision through the middle of the scrotum, extending it towards the inguinal region.
Make the incision straight, dividing the scrotum into two halves until it reaches the white membrane containing it. Remove and preserve this membrane, being more careful on the side attached to the egg-like structure, and ensure you fully expose it.
Then, cover the water-filled peritoneum with a wide pad and remove all the water. Afterwards, use forceps to separate the edges of the incision and stretch the peritoneum upwards without touching the testicular sac. Cut the peritoneum as best you can, either in its entirety or in pieces.
Especially the thin side, if you do not thoroughly inspect and cut it, you will not prevent the fluid from returning. If the egg (testicle) protrudes outside its skin during your work, after emptying the peritoneum, replace it and then sew together the edges of the scrotal skin.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals. If the egg has been damaged by another disease, you should tie the vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding and then cut the testicle from the scrotum, remove the egg, and treat it as we have mentioned.
If the fluid has collected on both sides, know that they are both testicles, so make an incision on the other side as you did on the first, and if it is equal to you to perform one operation or the other, then do so, and clean up the blood.
You insert a piece of wool that has been soaked in oil or rose fat into the cracks, making it from the outside with another piece soaked in a mixture of wine and oil, smoothing it over the testicles and covering the abdomen with a cloth, placing folded rags on top. And tie them above with the six-sided bandage, as shown in the picture:
Then take two pieces of cloth, sew them together, and stuff them with fluffy wool as shown, creating the ends that are tied around the waist using wet cotton or wool. Collect them tightly in a belt and take one end to be placed on the seat, extending it to the back.
The second method involves extending the incisions towards the groin, along both sides of the thigh below, and the remaining parts on the buttocks, then gathering all the tension in a belt around the waist. This girdle can also be made using cauterization instead of cutting with iron.
And take a thin, sharp iron to make an incision in the scrotum while it is protected as described until the white peritoneum containing the fluid becomes exposed, then use another iron in the same manner.
It resembles a Greek eye, then protect the peritoneum and drain all the moisture, then use clips to hold it in place and cauterize the layer containing it, cutting it as much as possible until you completely remove it, preserving the testis from fire.
Know that this method is safer and prevents blood loss, and it is better than cutting. If you encounter any obstacles during the cut or cauterization, such as a hot tumor, bleeding, or anything else, you should treat these issues with the appropriate remedies as previously mentioned.
If the patient is cowardly and does not endure this treatment due to its severity, then use a poultice as I have described, provided that it is healthy according to the evidence we have presented.
If the condition is a water-filled cyst, the patient should sit on a high chair, then use a broad scalpel to incise the cyst from below, applying a poultice along the body and ensuring a wide opening to drain all the fluid, then place cotton over the area and secure it with bindings.
Let it exude the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain at that time, apply a bandage to it; this is because the white membrane obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from draining out.
Then, a duck feather or the instrument used to extract the liquid of love (as depicted), or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and gather after six months or so, if it does, apply a bandage as before, and it will drive away the illness day by day.
Chapter 63.
On the fracture of the muscular tissue and its treatment.
Know that the fracture of this tissue is one of the dangers that can lead to death in most cases, so we advise against it and peace from it. I will mention the work related to it and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies composed of both female and male tissues, and this can be due to many reasons, either from a surplus of heat that deposits itself in the female tissue, or from a blow, and the color of the swelling is the same as the color of the body, and it does not have water.
And the tumor may be cystic and possibly it is a calcified tumor of black color without sensation, and it may result from the complication and swelling of arteries as mentioned previously, or from the swelling of veins. What was due to the swelling of arteries, one knows by the dispersion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers and it should not yield at all, while that which is due to the swelling of veins does not disperse when pressed with fingers; this type may be difficult to cut through and other tissues as well.
This involves incising the scrotal skin, extending the testis above and extracting it from the white tunic, freeing the vas deferens from its attachments, tying off the vessels, and cutting the vas deferens after ensuring all connections to the testis are removed, especially if the testis has adhered to surrounding tissues.
The egg should be extracted and cut, and if there is adhesion between any of the tunics or among the vessels, all such adhesions should be freed and cut roundly.
If it is a tissue adhesion behind the egg, all of it should be cut and the egg extracted as mentioned. After completing the procedure, apply a wound dressing soaked in rose petal oil and then treat it with all conventional remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixty-Four
In the treatment of an adra (swelling) accompanied by a dart-like pain.
The dalia (swelling) is a twisted mass, resembling a cluster with relaxed joints, making it difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk. In the treatment of this condition, the remedies are similar to those mentioned above.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as done by the pioneers. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then push the anthema (joint) down while holding the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels close to the penis.
And have another assistant hold it, pulling it taut, then cut with a wide, sharp scalpel in an elliptical shape alongside the vessels until they are exposed. Then, strip it from all sides as mentioned before, similar to the procedure for the carotid arteries in the throat. Then, insert a needle with a doubled thread into it.
Tie it in the first place where the dalia (swelling) was located, and also tie it at the last place. Then, make a cut down the middle, perpendicular to the body, and drain any accumulated foul liquids.
Then, treat the bruise with the same treatment as other wounds that require a period of time for the vessels supplying one of the ovaries to fall, which is not harmful. If the hernia affects all the vessels, one ovary should be removed along with the vessels, otherwise the egg will lack nourishment. By cutting the vessels, they wither and become useless.
Chapter LVI
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen towards the hips, causing the intestine to protrude through this hernial opening into one of the ovaries.
This hernia can either be a tear or an extension of the peritoneum, and these types are caused by numerous factors such as a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, etc. Its sign is that if it's due to an extension of the peritoneum, it occurs gradually over a long period of time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is level towards the depth as the peritoneum compresses the intestine. Its sign is that if it's due to a tear in the peritoneum, it causes severe sudden pain, and the swelling is visibly distinct beneath the skin near the site.
And thus, when the intestine protrudes and exits the peritoneum, it may also bring forth waste or thrubs, which are then called intestinal or thrub-like adhesions. It can also contain feces that become trapped there, leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes intense pain and rumbling, especially if pressed, treating this condition with heat is dangerous and one should be cautious. The treatment involves instructing the patient to gently push the intestine back into its cavity if possible.
Then the patient lies on their back between your hands, with their legs raised. You extend the skin covering the testicles and make a long cut along the scrotum. You then insert hooks into the edges of the incision to facilitate its opening as needed.
The incision should be deep enough to allow the testicle to be extracted. Then, you remove the layers of tissue beneath the scrotal skin until the white, tough peritoneum is exposed on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger into the space behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the testicle and the second peritoneal layer, you loosen the adhesions behind the testicle. Then, using your right hand, you gently fold it back into the scrotal skin while, with your left hand, you lift the white peritoneum and testicle towards the incision.
And command the servant to extend the egg above, and you release the adhesion from behind with a complete release, and inspect with your finger to see if there is any part of the twisted intestine in the firm white peritoneum; if you find something, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin next to the incision, then cut the ends of the bent thread so that there are four threads. Then arrange them one on top of the other in a cross-like manner and tie the peritoneum, which is under the scrotal skin, with a strong ligature from both sides; then also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing can reach the vessels they nourish. So that nothing of a hot tumor appears, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, away from it by less than two fingers; after these two ligatures, leave some peritoneum under the scrotal skin as thick as a finger.
So that nothing of a hot tumor appears, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, away from it by less than two fingers; after these two ligatures, leave some peritoneum under the scrotal skin as thick as a finger. Cut off the rest in a circular manner, and remove the egg with it; then make an incision below the scrotal skin from which blood flows, as we described earlier, then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and apply the ligature as described.
And if the white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it with caution from bleeding, is often encountered, leave the bandage until it falls on its own. If its fall is slow, then pour hot water over it and carry what causes it to sweat until it falls.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six
In this spongy tissue, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that one should proceed as we described for the tissue attached to a bone, by binding the vessels after carefully cutting them below.
Then make a cut in the middle and treat the cyst by opening it until the vessels fall, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Six
In hernias that occur in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may expose itself as we mentioned, but nothing from the intestines is exposed to the female side; if it were to descend slightly, it would return on its own at all times.
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestines and testes descend into the scrotum, and this is due to the extension of the peritoneum that occurs in the groin as we have mentioned. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and wrinkles the area, and its treatment involves cauterization as we have previously described.
It may also be treated with a iron on this manner: the patient lies on their back between your hands, then you make a vertical cut in the protruding hernia to a depth of three fingers, and then you separate the peritoneum layers beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath it is exposed, you take a strip of material, place it over the area where the peritoneum has separated, and press it deep into the abdomen. Then, you sew the two edges together, forming a continuous seam to close the hernia.
Then, you take the edge of the material and do not cut the peritoneum or touch the testicle or any other structure, as we taught you for treating intestinal hernias. Then, treat it with surgical methods.
If the stitches tear, clean the wound and bandage it until it heals; then the peritoneum will contract and the hernia protrusion will not increase.
The best course of action in this matter is preferable because it leads to greater safety.
Chapter LXVI
In the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The scrotal skin often relaxes in certain individuals, without the muscles within becoming slack, and this can make it unattractive. Therefore, for those who wish to treat this condition, they should put the patient to sleep on their back.
He should cut away all the relaxed skin from the thick layer beneath, then gather and close the edges with stitches, either three or four in total. The stitches should be secure, after which the excess relaxed skin is cut between the stitches.
Then treat it like any other wound, until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter LXVII
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not mention it in this book, but I have only mentioned it for two reasons: one is so that the doctor, when asked about it, will know the treatment for whoever encounters it; and the other is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
As in the case of lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by pressure or by incision and cutting. In the case of pressure, we make the animal sit in hot water until its female organs relax, soften, and hang down.
Then, you press it with your hand until it dissolves and is no longer noticeable upon touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the scrotum with your left hand, then tie the testicles and make a single cut on each testicle.
Until the testicles are exposed, cut them after removing the skin, leaving only the thin membrane covering the vessels. This method of castration is better than the one involving pressure.
Because pressure might leave some of the female organs intact, making the animal desire copulation; then you treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy
In the treatment of hermaphroditism.
In men, hermaphroditism presents in two types: one where it appears below the scrotum or within the scrotal sac, taking the form of a vagina-like structure with hair, and urine may discharge from the part located within the scrotum.
In women, there is one type, where it appears above the vagina on the pubis, resembling a small penis emerging externally, and both resemble females; treatment for all three types.
For both types of men and the single type of woman, one should remove the excess flesh until its trace is eliminated, then treat it like any other surgical wound until healing occurs. However, for the second type of man from whom urine discharges from the part within the scrotum, there is no intervention, nor will it ever heal.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On the removal of the clitoris and flesh growing from the vagina in women.
The clitoris may grow beyond the normal size, becoming prominent and aesthetically displeasing, and in some women, it can enlarge to the extent that it resembles a penis, enabling vaginal intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the clitoris with your hand or a forceps and cut it, but do not be excessive in cutting, especially at the base, lest there be bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical treatment until it heals. As for the flesh that grows, it is flesh that grows in the cervix until it fills it.
It may protrude outward, similar to a carbuncle. Therefore, some early scholars call it the "carbuncle disease," and you should cut it as you would cut the clitoris, treating it until it heals.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of epityphic stone (urinary tract stones).
Epityphic refers to a condition where a woman's vagina is either unperforated or has a small opening, either naturally occurring since birth or developed later due to various ailments. The latter, acquired conditions, may be caused by excessive growth of flesh.
It can be a thin or thick membrane, located deep within the uterus, or along its sides, or at the top or bottom, preventing intercourse, conception, and childbirth. It may also cause amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). This condition is identified by skilled midwives through examination.
If the blockage is visible, examine it; if not, use your fingers or a speculum. If the blockage is made of thin perineum tissue and is near the labia, quickly make an incision by creating a fold in the labia and placing both thumbs.
For a woman lying on her back with legs apart, forcefully spread the labia to puncture the thin perineum tissue, and then take a piece of cloth, soak it in oil, apply it to the area, and have sexual intercourse with the woman daily to prevent the tissue from fusing again.
If the perineum tissue is thick and dense, use a wide scalpel similar to a sheet of paper to make an incision. If the blockage is made of grown flesh, hang it with pincers and cut it. Have on hand remedies to stop bleeding without stinging, such as alum, chalk, and myrrh mixed with white egg whites.
Then, use a wide lead pipe to prevent the wound from healing quickly. Hold it for several days and apply a dry cotton string as a dressing, treating it with all manner of scar treatments until it heals. Sometimes, a new flesh growth may occur in the womb, which should be cut off in the same way.
Unless it is a benign tumor, a cancerous growth in the womb should not be treated with iron under any circumstances.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that occur in the female genital area.
As for hemorrhoids, it is an inflammation of the veins' openings such that they spill out a significant and continuous amount of blood. If hemorrhoids are chronic, they transform into warts, and I have mentioned in the previous section their types, symptoms, and signs, which we will recall here.
As for what is curable and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not manifest externally, then they are not to be treated with iron. Rather, those located at the uterine opening, which can be felt, are the ones that should be treated.
A woman should enter a cold house, then use a scalpel or coarse cloth to remove the warts and cut them back to their roots. Then, she should apply pressure over the bleeding area without causing further injury.
She should apply materials such as castor oil, rhubarb, and gum olibanum, then raise her legs against a wall for a while. After that, she should lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, she should sit in a bath of sumac, pomegranate seeds, and gallnut, and then mix flour from barley with honey and vinegar.
If the blood stops, apply a compress to the back. If not, fasten the splint firmly to the ribs and breasts without condition. Then take a woolen cloth, dip it in a mixture of traethith extract, camel's tongue extract, or olive branch extract with sumac drink, and secure it to the site.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pimple, it resembles the heads of hair, rough to the touch, so you should cut what is visible of it, as you would with warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Seven
In the case of an abscess in the womb.
There may be various types of tumors in the womb, such as cancer, sarcoma, ulcers, fistulas, hemorrhoids, leeches, and warts, among others. All these conditions and their symptoms have been detailed in the preceding sections.
In this article, we should also mention the hot tumor that appears in the womb if it is among the tumors with a prolonged course. You should examine it; if the pain of the tumor is acute at its onset, with palpitations, inflammation, and fever.
If the skin turns red due to sensation, do not hurry to dress it. Treat it with what aids maturation. Once these symptoms subside, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean back.
She should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, keeping her thighs apart, and place her arms under her knees with a bandage to secure them.
Therefore, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument to open the cervix, whose image is depicted later. When using this instrument, one must measure the depth of the woman's uterus to ensure that what enters through the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument causes harm due to its depth, one should place pads on the cervix's edge to prevent it from going too deep into the uterus. The thread running through the instrument should be from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the assistant turns the thread until the cervix opens. If the discharge appears and feels soft when touched with the hand, it should be incised at its base with a broad blade once the period is complete.
A soft thread soaked in rose fat or green oil, with some contraction, should be placed in the wound. The thread should extend from the incision in the cervix to outside, where it is wrapped around the uterus and groin area with clean wool soaked in boiled baker's yeast water.
Then, it is treated after two days with the ointment suitable for that purpose until it heals.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water in which the root of fennel or long radish has boiled, and finally return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden internally within the uterus.
One should refrain from treating it with iron, but rather treat it as we have mentioned in the classification.
Chapter LXXV.
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses that emerge outside the normal form.
The midwife should first know the signs of normal childbirth, which include when the woman feels a need to move lower and longs for fresh air, and when she finds relief from the pains she is experiencing.
And if the baby comes out quickly, know that this is a normal delivery, and the baby should come out headfirst, with the placenta either attached or hanging from the umbilical cord. If you observe these signs, you should squeeze the woman's abdomen to help the baby deliver more swiftly.
If the foetus descends with the placenta, it is a normal and desirable delivery. However, if the foetus emerges with its legs first, or its hands before its head and legs, it is an abnormal and undesirable birth.
If one hand or leg emerges first, or the head and hand, or if it curls up and possibly turns over on its back, these are undesirable positions. The midwife must be skilled and careful in handling such situations to avoid mistakes.
I will explain each of these positions and how to handle them so that you can recognize and manage them. If the foetus emerges with its head first in a normal position, but the woman feels intense pain and her strength weakens, seat her on a chair and have other women support her.
Moisturize the womb with cooked fennel and wet oils. Then, the midwife inserts a small scalpel or uses her nail to make a cut in the placenta, allowing the fluids to drain. Finally, she presses on the woman's abdomen to deliver the foetus.
If the foetus does not descend, the woman should be given a mixture of fennel saliva and alum (شيرج) oil. After this treatment, she should be instructed to sneeze and sniff with a cold compress while holding her mouth and nose closed. This will often prompt the foetus to come down immediately, and if one hand or leg emerges first, gently guide it back inside, little by little.
If the baby cannot be delivered, place the woman on a bed and raise her legs above, then shake the bed on the ground while she grips tightly to prevent falling. If the hands do not deliver the baby and it dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
If delivery is difficult, tie the woman's hands with a cloth and gently pull them, and it will come out. If the baby is delivered on its feet, you should push them up and then gradually turn the baby until it is in a normal position. Then take one of its legs and slowly stretch it.
If both legs are delivered, order her to cough and blow her nose with a sponge, and it will come out. If it does not come out as described, gradually turn the baby until it is in its natural position; then it will come out smoothly. If all else fails, try again.
Take some of the saliva from a snake, fennel seed, and brahmi fat, mix them well in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen, and sit her in warm water until the contractions begin.
If you see that her contractions are weak, prepare a warm compress and apply it. Once she grasps the compress for an hour, sit her on a chair, then make her cough while covering her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen. The baby will come out at this point, coming out on its knees and hands.
If the patient is in this position, gradually insert your hands and then have the woman lie on her stomach with her legs hanging down over the side of the bed while she holds her hands. Then gently press down on her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so they are pointing downwards. If the baby does not come out, take both of her legs and move them vigorously. Then press down on the perineum little by little until the baby ascends, and the midwife can then insert a hand to help position the baby.
Order the woman to squat until the baby is born, with the baby's hand extended and reaching for one of her hands. Gradually withdraw your hand if she cannot grasp it. If she cannot stand, have her lie down on her side.
Have her lie on her side on the bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the birthing chair (latuq) as described, applying lubrication. If she experiences strong contractions, sit her up on a chair and assist in returning her hand to its natural position while positioning the baby correctly. Encourage her to squat until the baby is born.
When the baby is born upside down, stretching its hands with its face towards its mother's back, the midwife should take hold of the baby's hand and gently turn it, positioning it correctly. Once positioned, apply the lubricants as described previously.
Then make her move a little bit by bit. If she does, sit her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side, then instruct her to twist and sneeze, and the foetus will come out upright on its side.
If it descends into the womb in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is free from moisture. If it is attached to the face or neck of the foetus, cut it from the navel so that it does not suffocate and die. Then push the foetus back inside until it is in the correct position.
Instruct the woman to twist several times, and it will come out easily, the birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins often come into the world in threes or fours and survive, except rarely. Five is something beyond nature; they never survive.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, and they are separated by a membrane that connects them at the navel of each one. They can come out naturally and easily, or they can come out abnormally as we have described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and turn to the forms we have described, treat them as we have described. The midwife should be gentle and act with caution, taking time and finding a way around each shape using her skill for the safety of the baby.
Description of the fetuses envisioned in the womb that fall, it may be one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten, and it has been confirmed for me that a woman miscarried seven, and another had fifteen, all of them having envisioned those fetuses.
By the grace of the wise Creator, all this should be known by the midwife, for she too may one day face such a situation and respond with what is appropriate.
Chapter LXVII
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If, after applying the treatments mentioned in the previous sections, the dead fetus does not come out and you need to use your hand, you should examine her. If the woman is strong and free from any symptoms that could cause harm, she should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be inclined downward, her legs elevated, and she should be supported from both sides by an assistant or tied to the bed to prevent her body from shifting when extending the fetus.
Then, the cervix should be lubricated with moist oils, including salvia, fennel seed, and flaxseed meal. The midwife should then take her wet hand and insert it into the womb gently, seeking the place where the forceps can be placed to deliver the fetus.
If the fetus is in a position where it is about to descend by its head, then hooks should be inserted into its eyes, back, mouth, throat, under the mustache or jaw, or in the areas near the ribs or under the ribcage.
If, however, it descends by its legs, then in the groin and middle ribs. One should hold the hook with the right hand and make its fold between the left hand's fingers, and gently insert the hand and hook into some of these mentioned positions.
Until it reaches something hollow, then insert another hook in front of it, or a third if necessary, to ensure an equal pull and prevent leaning towards one side. Then extend it evenly, not just straight but moving to each side as well.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when it is removed, and in between, the extension should be relaxed. If any part becomes stuck, the midwife should lubricate some fingers with grease and insert them to turn what is stuck. If some of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other positions.
It should be raised slightly so that the fetus comes out completely. If a hand comes out before others and cannot be pushed back due to compression, it should be wrapped with a cloth and then pulled until it fully emerges, after which it can be cut off.
Either at the wrist or the forearm, and so you should do for the other hand and feet, if the fetus' head is large and there is pressure during delivery, or if water has collected in its head, then you should insert a sharp knife between the fingers.
And cut through it with this instrument, which is called a forceps, that comes after the description of all other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus' head is large, you should naturally cut through or reshape the skull with forceps as we mentioned, then extract the bones using pincers, and if the head emerges but becomes compressed at the collarbone, cut until the moisture in the chest drains.
If the chest then collapses, but it does not open and the fetus cannot be delivered, cut as best you can. If it is located below the abdomen or has a hernia, remove it so that the moisture drains from it.
If the fetus is in a position where its feet are facing down, it can be easily drawn and positioned towards the cervix. If there is compression in the abdomen or chest, use a cloth wrapped around your hand to grasp it, then cut through the abdomen or chest until the contents drain out.
If all other organs have been removed and the head is retracted but the cervix is open, insert the left hand and, if the cervix is dilated, grasp the head with your fingers and pull it towards the cervix using a hook or hooks inserted into the vagina.
If the cervix has adhered to a hot tumour, it should not be forcibly separated, but rather moist, fatty substances should be applied, and drugs used, and one should sit in water that relaxes and moistens.
If the foetus is on its side and can be straightened, the same methods mentioned for a live foetus should be used; if this is not possible, it should be cut and removed, ensuring no part of the placenta remains inside. Once the treatment is complete, the same remedies for hot tumours in the womb should be employed.
If bleeding occurs, one should immerse themselves in contracting water and use all other remedies; I have seen a woman who had become pregnant and the foetus died in her womb, then she became pregnant again with that same foetus.
Then the other foetus also died, and after a long time, a tumour appeared in her womb, swelling until it opened and discharged pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal, so I applied some strong ointments that draw out the infection.
From the wound, a bone emerged, and then another, days later. I was amazed, as the abdomen is not usually a place for bones; I suspected that these were bones from the dead foetus, so I examined the wound and removed many bones from the head of the foetus.
I continued to follow this course until I removed many bones and the woman was in the best condition, having lived thus for a considerable time, during which a small amount of pus discharged from the wound. And here I present this rare case.
Because it contains knowledge and aid for the skilled physician in their handiwork of healing.
Chapter Seventy-Seven
In it are images of the instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Image of a spiral instrument for opening the cervix.
This instrument, which is used to open the cervix, has two spirals on either side of the handle, except that this spiral should be softer than the clamp and made of rosewood or cypress wood. Each handle should be as thick as two fingers.
And both spirals should be directed towards the finger, with a length of one and a half palm-spans, and in the middle of the handles, two guides made of the same wood are attached, each with a length of half a palm-span or slightly more, and a width of two fingers or slightly more. These guides are crucial.
These are the two instruments that enter the cervix to open it when you rotate the spirals. Another similar instrument, softer and lighter, is also depicted.
Surgeons make these from ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, each with two prongs as you can see, one shent-long and two fingers wide. To open the womb, use these.
Then, have the woman sit on a bed with her legs spread apart, and insert these two prongs into the cervix while holding the tool's end between her thighs. Open your hand on the tool as you would with hooks, adjusting its position to control the degree of cervical opening. Until the midwife achieves their desired effect, consider another spiral mentioned by the pioneers:
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus:
Image of the forceps used to grasp the fetus' head:
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end, as you can see, and may be shaped like a rectangle similar to hooks, as illustrated. Its teeth are like those of a saw, used to cut and reshape:
Image of another instrument:
Image of a hook:
This forceps should have a slight thickness to prevent it from breaking when drawing the fetus with it; an image of two-pronged forceps:
An image of wide-bladed scissors for cutting the fetus:
These instruments, the more diverse they are and the better equipped the craftsman, the faster his work progresses and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not underestimate any instrument that might be useful in your possession; for there will certainly come a time when you need it.
Chapter Seventy-Eight
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta becomes stuck after childbirth, the patient should be instructed to grasp herself, then cough forcefully while you press on her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it passes out this way, otherwise take a pair of tweezers.
Drill a hole in the cover and insert open herbs such as fenugreek, sage, mint, chamomile, parsley, plantain, and artichoke root; soak them in water and boil them. Then place a silver pipe over the hole in the cover, with the other end inserted into the cervix.
Hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus, then sneeze as mentioned, for the placenta will come out swiftly. If it remains after this treatment and does not exit, then the midwife should dip her left hand in syringe oil or elephant's spittle.
Then, insert your hand in the vagina and feel for the placenta. If you find it, grasp it and slowly stretch it out to remove it. If it is attached deeply within the uterus, insert the hand as described until you locate the placenta, then gently pull it out with caution.
To prevent the uterus from tearing with strong pulling, it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling increased, which will cause it to respond and release the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, the treatment has been described through sneezing, the use of a cup, and herbs.
If it does not come out with all the described methods, avoid using force on it during subsequent attempts. Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh and apply a four-ingredient ointment, as it will soften it after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, unless it becomes gangrenous, in which case a foul odor will spread to the stomach and head, causing harm to the patient. In such cases, appropriate smoke should be used.
Therefore, some of the pioneers tried smoke from herbs and dried fig, an image of the machine that evaporates a woman during menstruation, retention of the placenta, and similar conditions.
It is made of lead resembling a funnel, or it can be made of copper, where the thin end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, with incense placed on the coals. It should be held until that incense is consumed and replaced repeatedly.
Chapter LXXIX
In the treatment of an unpierced hemorrhoid.
A midwife may encounter a case where many boys are born with unpierced hemorrhoids, blocked by a thin membrane. She should puncture this membrane with her finger, or if necessary, use a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then, she should place a woollen pad soaked in wine and oil on it and treat the area with ointments until it heals. If there is a concern that it might become blocked again, she can insert a small lead pipe into the opening for several days, removing it when the child needs to defecate.
A blocked hemorrhoid may also be due to a clot or tumor. In such cases, the clot should be broken, and then treated as mentioned, using wine, oil, ointments, and possibly a lead pipe for temporary relief.
Chapter Eighty
In the treatment of hemorrhoids that occur in the lower region.
Hemorrhoids that occur in the lower region are a complication and thickening that takes place near the anus, either externally or within the surrounding space, and hemorrhoid may be one or more in number.
If this complication persists, it will open and release a white watery discharge or thin pus. Some hemorrhoids may extend to the anus and colon, while others that are not extending may be recognized by what is discharged with feces and flatulence during defecation.
Sometimes worms may emerge from them, and they can be hemorrhoids if in the surrounding space they extend to the bladder or the urethra, or to the joint of the thigh and the coccyx, and what is known as a hemorrhoid that extends to the anus but is not extending.
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin needle made of copper or iron into the hemorrhoid if it is not curved. If it is curved, insert a thinner lead needle or a horsehair into it.
Until you feel the needle or hair in your finger, if you don't feel anything and nothing comes out of the opening in the form of feces, flatulence, or worms as we mentioned, then know that it is not extending, so act quickly to treat it.
If the fistula opens into the bladder or urethra, its indication is the passage of urine from it and the inability of the wound to heal with medication. But if it opens into the hip joint or the perineum, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If there is no curvature of the bone, pain in a specific direction, constant discharge of pus, and no treatment or ointment works, then these fistulas that open in this way will never heal.
Treating them is a futile effort for those who attempt it without knowledge, as for those that are not fistulas or are not chronic, healing is possible with iron, as I will describe and what I have experienced: place the patient on their back with their hands under their buttocks.
He should raise his legs and tilt his hips towards his stomach. Then, insert the copper or lead probe into the fistula if it has a curvature, until you feel where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated on its own, exposing itself without you feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then be certain that it is a fistula that cannot be cured as we said earlier.
They have said that it heals in some people rarely, and among the treatments expected to be beneficial is to apply a thin iron over the size of the fistula as mentioned before, and insert a protector inside the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then return it twice or three times.
Until you know that all of that excessive, accumulated flesh similar to a bird's feather tube has burned, then treat it with a wet twist in butter, until that burnt flesh comes out, and then treat it with sealing ointments; if it heals, then the treatment is complete.
If the probe does not penetrate to your finger in the anus and there is a thick barrier of flesh or membrane between them, and you see the fistula behind the skin surface, then make an incision at the beginning of the fistula. As you pass the probe through the fissure, following its end inside the fistula until you reach where the probe's tip stops, then remove it and discard it, then clean away that excessive flesh similar to a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with sealing ointments until it heals. If blood interferes with your cutting of that excess flesh, the best course of action is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, as burning it with fire combines two beneficial conditions: it burns away the excessive flesh.
Cutting the blood and drying the humors, then treating it with a wet twist in butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the site pus, and those burnt meats come out in the pus, then treat the wound at that time with pastes that promote the growth of solid flesh.
These are the drugs that contract and dry; if they heal, they will not relapse. If the fistula has extended into the depths of the seat (anus) and is distant from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the seat and explore it.
If you feel the probe and between it and you is a membrane or flesh, and it is close to perforation, then the treatment is not but in the way of hope and desire; that is, you use one of three methods: either you cauterize it as we have said.
Or you open it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the thread and treat from close by, but do not overextend the cut lest you sever the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to pass stool involuntarily. Then treat it as we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or you penetrate that membrane and perforate it after cutting it near the anus, as we said, either with a probe or any other sharp instrument; then clean all the hardened flesh in the cut as much as possible.
Then, the surgeon should remove the entire wound along with the fissure and the upper opening until it heals, leaving the fistula open inside the seat, which will be lighter for the patient, and the fistula may remain in this state.
If, when introducing the probe into the fistula, it is on one side of the seat towards the surface of the body with the skin and ring of the seat, then take a probe with a pointed end like a shoemaker's needle in this way:
Introduce a twisted thread of five or more threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is perforated at the edge of the seat from inside near the surface,
Then, pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the seat and pulling one end of the thread while gathering both ends and tightening them, leaving it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the meats between the thread ends fall off, then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the fistula opening is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, but do not make it too deep to avoid damaging the muscle. Then, proceed with treatment as we mentioned until it heals.
An image of the chisel-like surgical knife used to cut away spinal disc hernias: the bevel is very sharp on one side and blunter on the other, so as not to cut through unnecessary tissue as you can see.
Chapter LXXVIII.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, cutting them, and healing fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: those inside the rectum, resembling red blowers or, like grapes, small and large, from which blood always flows.
They can be solitary or numerous, and when outside the rectum, they are usually less moist, releasing yellow water or a slight amount of blood, and they are of the body's natural color.
For treatment of internal hemorrhoids, order the patient to defecate and clean themselves until the anus opens, revealing the hemorrhoids, then quickly grasp them with tweezers or your fingernail and cut them at their base; if they do not stay in place due to moisture and relaxation, you can use a ligature.
Be careful to cauterize them with a coarse cloth or piece of bread soaked in vinegar, or pull them out with your fingers and cut them, then sprinkle some sharp fine particles (as described in the burning section) to serve as a substitute for burning, or use an instrument to remove them as mentioned previously in the burning chapter.
Then treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the seat does not allow for expulsion, inject the patient with a solution that causes a slight burn to wash out what is in the seat and allow for quick expulsion when the patient moves. The treatment of warts that protrude from the seat is easy and simple.
If one prefers to remove it with their fingernail or hook it onto a fishing line and cut it off, they should then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. If one dislikes cutting with iron, they should use drilling instead, taking a twisted thread and inserting it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and insert the needle into its base on the other side, winding the thread around both sides of the needle and crossing them below, tightly pulling the wart, then tie the thread and remove the needle, doing this to all warts, leaving one unpierced.
To drain any excess blood, then place a cloth soaked in rose fat or pitch on the seat and leave it there, instructing the patient to remain still, until it falls off. Once the warts have fallen, treat them with ointments and all other remedies until they heal.
As for the treatment of cracks, it often arises from dry scales and a stagnant nature. If it persists and no remedy works, one should use a scalpel or their fingernail to remove the top layer of dried scales, allowing the moisture beneath to heal and the crack to close.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the treatment with greater force than before, causing bleeding and flaking. Then treat it again, for it will cure.
Chapter LXXVIII
In the treatment of reverse nails, unreversed nails, warts, and dry moles.
A nail is a round knot that resembles a screw head, present throughout the body, especially on the soles of feet and toes, causing pain while walking.
One should make an incision around the nail, using a knife or hook to extract it from its root, then treat it as mentioned previously. As for warts, each one is a small, rough, rounded protuberance above the surface of the body.
It often appears on boys' hands. Its treatment involves extending the wart and cutting or drilling it with silk thread or a hair, until it falls off. You may also burn it or treat it with a sharp medicine as previously mentioned.
Warts, both reversed and non-reversed, can be removed with the instrument mentioned in the treatment of moles. As for moles, they are small, rough, thick growths on the body's surface, extending deeply and, if affected by cold, causing a sensation similar to that of a bee sting.
And it should be done all over the body, most often in the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube of goose feather or strong eagle feather and place it around the ant until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube to cut through what is around the ant.
It should go deep into the flesh, and the ant will be removed from its origin. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be rigid and slightly curved to facilitate its grip and rotation by the fingers, as previously described for cauterizing warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter 83.
In the following images are shown the instruments used for injection in cases of hemorrhoids, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, porcelain, copper, or brass, and small or large versions can be crafted according to the users' needs. Those used for treating young boys, with narrow or painful hemorrhoids, should be very thin, as shown in the image of a large syringe.
Its upper end, by which the catheters are tied, is wide in this manner and has a barrier where the catheter is tied as you see, and its lower end, which enters the urethra, is solid, very smooth on one side and has two holes on one side and one hole on the other.
The size of the hole should be slightly less than or equal to the thickness of the urethra, and the catheter made from the bladder of an animal or sheep's urinary tract, shaped like a small ship, should have a diameter of one finger.
Make many holes as it curves, with a thickness of one finger between each hole, and then insert a thin thread made from twisted yarn, about ten stitches or so, into these holes to hold the catheter in place like a ship. If the medication is inserted, tighten the tip of the syringe between the two stones tightly and then inject it. This is a diagram of the catheter and the hole:
To insert the medication, fill the urinary tract or bladder with the medicine while it is warm to the best of the patient's tolerance, and be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. Then, have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs.
Place a mat or blanket underneath, then rub the tip of the syringe with grease, egg white, horse saliva, or the like. Insert it gently into the urethra and have the assistant hold the catheter handle in both hands, squeezing tightly to expel all the medication into the intestines.
Then the syringe is withdrawn, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medicine promotes its exit, he should grasp it as much as possible; if he sleeps through the night, this is most beneficial for relief. If it is injected in cases of diarrhea, and the medicine is hurried out, the syringe should be repeated until recovery occurs.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the anus, the syringe should be very gentle, smooth like those used to inject children, and this is a picture of a soft, flexible syringe.
Chapter Eighty-Four
In the treatment of surgical wounds.
As I mentioned in the division regarding the treatment of burns, here I recall the treatment of surgical wounds both by manual methods and medicaments, so let me say that surgical procedures vary according to the nature of the wound and the location of the incision.
There are numerous things that can cause surgical wounds, such as a stone stab, sword slash, knife cut, spear thrust, or arrowhead wound, among many other potential causes.
As for surgical wounds based on their location on the body, they include injuries to the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or liver, among other vital organs.
In describing the treatment of certain wounds to serve as a model and rule for all other wounds, I begin with simple head injuries, especially since those that are complex will be mentioned in the first section of the third chapter of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, but rather a stab from a stone or similar object, and only the skin is pierced, and the wound is large and I fear the development of a hot swelling for the patient, then promptly cut it with a knife at the right place. Do not delay this, and drain the blood from him to the extent of his strength. If there is no obstacle to cutting, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is slight, let the incision be made on the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against eating, drinking, and heavy foods. If there is an obstacle to cutting, let him reduce his food intake and avoid meat and drinks. Apply a cotton ball soaked in rose fat or, alternatively, with a drink that has a constricting effect, to the wound if a hot swelling occurs.
If you are confident that a hot swelling will not occur, apply pressure to the wound if it is still fresh with its blood and has not been changed by the dry air I will describe below. However, if it has been affected by the air, use some ointment on it.
Until the pus drains, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, from a sword or similar, and its edges do not meet, sew it together as I have described in the section on stitching abdominal wounds.
If the skin reveals the bone, is hanging loose and can only be secured with a thin splint, cut it away, then treat the wound with remedies to harden the flesh in its place, and order the patient to eat foods that are firm, such as heads, shoulders, and similar cuts.
If there is decay in the skin, not adhering to the bone, cut off the entire decayed part and discard it. Then treat the wound. If there is a blood vessel or nerve still bleeding from these wounds, locate the vessel.
If it does not heal, amputate it with a scalpel and tie it off. If necessary, if what we mentioned does not help, cut away the affected part until the blood stops. For small, simple wounds, their treatment is easy and straightforward; all that is needed is to apply these remedies while the wound still has its blood.
Before it is affected by the air, the recipe for the poultice is to take a part of resin, two parts of camphor, and three parts of slaked lime or unslaked lime, crush them all, sift them, and fill the wound with this mixture, tightening it well until a strong adhesive is formed on top.
It forms a clot, then it is tightened from above with bandages and left without loosening until it does not swell, for the treatment will not leave it until healing occurs, and it may heal on its own with just lime if resin and pitch are not available.
This process can also be effective in many major surgeries if the technique is mastered, and the bandages are tight, especially when the wounds are still fresh, unless they have been affected by air, which may cause some changes, particularly during the summer season.
Placing these bandages alone is not sufficient; they should be accompanied by specific treatments such as applying warmed ointments or a porridge made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, to promote the discharge of pus. Then, other treatments can be applied until healing occurs.
If a fracture occurs with the wound, especially if it is a simple break in a bone, it should be immobilized with splints (gajf), as mentioned in the treatment of skull fractures. If the wound is in the neck, there is no distinction in treatment from a head wound of similar severity.
If a nerve in the neck is cut, there is no remedy other than to avoid tightening it excessively with items like ropes or bands, as they can damage and spasm the nerve.
Never apply cold to a wound, for the nerve's essence is cold and its connection to the brain, the most noble of organs, requires that the treatments applied be gentle, such as نوره (a medicinal compound) washed with sweet water, repeated, moistened with oil or rose fat.
If you also wash it with sweet water and other mineral stones in the same manner, and moistened pastes, but if the wound is large, use stitching or bind it tightly with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If a wound has a deep cavity or an accumulation of pus at the bottom, drain it into the lowest point; if a blood vessel is severed and its blood is flowing, amputate it or tie it off or plug it if necessary.
If the wound has cut some or all of the pharyngeal mucosa and the jugular veins are intact, sew together the edges of the skin over the pharynx, without touching the pharynx itself, then smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, and tightly tighten it, leaving it for several days.
Then treat it with pastes that have a constricting and drying effect until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are fragments of bone, extract them entirely or as many as possible; if you cannot, leave it until the wound putrefies and heals, making it easier to remove.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle over it the powder we have described. If the wound becomes gangrenous and forms an ulcer, treat it as mentioned in its section, under chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see it has penetrated deeply, observe if air escapes from it. If the patient breathes and air comes out, know that it is a fatal wound. If there is no deep penetration and the wound is fresh with blood, do not immediately sprinkle powder on it and do not tighten it, lest the blood become trapped in its depths.
It then turns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply a soothing ointment and mix it with water twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, place a old cotton wick in the wound to absorb the discharge and let the patient sleep with the wound exposed.
To wash out any accumulation, and if the wound has healed after three days or more without spasms, palpitations, shortness of breath or other adverse symptoms, know that the wound is healing well and treat it with bandaging and other remedies until it is completely cured.
If it is not possible to see the base of the discharge and it continues constantly, know that it has become a chronic ulcer. Treat it as mentioned in its section, washing out the wound and applying bandages. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with stitching as previously described.
Depending on the size, if it is large or small, and if it has affected the bone and cut off fragments from it, examine the wound and immediately remove those fragments. If they are clean, leave them; if not, remove them.
If the wound becomes gangrenous, it will be easier to remove the fragments; as for other injuries occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment is similar to what we have mentioned.
Chapter LXXVIII
On abdominal wounds, the emergence of the intestines, and their stitching.
The abdominal wound may be large or small or medium-sized. A large one might expose the intestines or several inches of them, making their reinsertion and stitching more difficult.
And a small wound can also be difficult in a different way, requiring the intestines to be carefully and promptly returned to their place; if not, they may bloat and thicken, making reinsertion even more challenging. Thus, the medium-sized wound is preferable, as it does not present the same difficulties with returning the intestines as the larger ones do.
Know that the stitching of the abdomen has four aspects; two general stitches suitable for stitching the abdomen and other body wounds, and two specific stitches that are used exclusively for abdominal wounds.
And I will describe them to you one by one, explaining and clarifying: If the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes and it is difficult to push it back, this is due to one of two reasons: either because the tear is small as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, then you should warm it by immersing a sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or water in which dried dates, saffron, and fenugreek have been cooked, until the intestine relaxes and the inflation disappears.
This can also be achieved with a drink that contains astringents, which is better than water alone in relaxing the inflation. If you observe the inflation has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which fennel or aniseed have been cooked, as this will facilitate its entry.
If, after this treatment, it still cannot be pushed back, make a small tear in the opening with the instrument used for cutting away hernias, and this initial treatment is preferable if successful. However, one may only resort to making a cut after necessity arises and all other methods have failed.
One side of the instrument is curved and limited, while the other side is unrestricted. The thin end is not as sharp as the scalpel, but slightly blunted, and it resembles a small spear. If the wound widens and the intestines are exposed, it should be returned to its natural shape.
Its specific position is preferable if possible, but if the wound is wide and located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs higher than their head. If it's in the upper abdomen, the patient should be positioned with their head and chest higher than the rest of their body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to position the surgical site higher than the other side. This should be applied in both major and medium surgeries.
In minor surgeries, position it as best you can. Then, have an assistant gently hold the wound open with both hands, revealing a portion at a time to the surgeon.
This is the general method of stitching: take a needle or several needles suitable for the size of the wound, leave a gap the thickness of a thumb on one side of the wound, and sew with a single needle without threading it with a suture through both edges of the skin. With the edges of the peritoneum beneath the skin, from within to penetrate them from that side, and having gathered the edges of the skin and the peritoneum, it becomes four openings, then tie with a doubled thread around the needle on both sides multiple times until the edges of the wound meet firmly.
Then, leave a space the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, then tie it with thread as you did with the first needle, continuing to do so with as many needles as needed until the entire wound is filled, and let the needles be placed between the thick and thin parts.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin, therefore they should be placed at a medium point between thin and thick, and the needle should not be inserted near the edge of the skin.
To prevent the flesh from tearing and the wound from opening before healing, and also to avoid excessive stitching that might hinder healing, then cut the ends of the needles to avoid harming the patient during sleep, and use pieces of cotton cloth as handles to secure the needle ends.
And leave it until you are sure that the wound has healed, and this type of stitching with needles is most successful in minor surgeries, as it may be sufficient to stitch them with one, two, or a few needles.
As for the technique of stitching the second layer of the general type, it is to gather all four margins - that is, both skin margins and both peritoneal margins - in one operation using a needle with a moderate amount of spun thread, neither too fine nor too thick. Then, after these four margins have been stitched together by the needle, the needle is returned from the direction it started.
The thread should be woven across the top of the wound, forming stitches similar to those used for sealing a bladder, which tightens the contents and leaves a space between each stitch, approximately the thickness of the small finger. This type of stitching is well-known to everyone.
By using this stitching, a surgeon treated a man who had been cut with a knife. The abdominal wound was over an inch in diameter, with more than two inches of the middle intestine protruding. The tear was located in the center of the abdomen.
After 24 hours, the intestine was returned to its original position within the wound. The wound healed in approximately 15 days, and he was treated until he fully recovered and lived for many years, engaging in all his usual activities. The doctors had judged that he would never recover.
It is surprising that I did not treat it with a salve, as I was in a place without any medicinal supplies. Instead, I applied old cotton wool to the wound twice daily and kept it clean with honey water until it healed.
And as for one of the two types of sewing, I mention it based on the words of Galen: to begin sewing with the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside, then, when the needle has penetrated through the skin and muscle in a straight line across the entire length of the abdomen.
I leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where the needle was inserted, and I insert the needle into its other edge from inside to outside in the other layer of fascia; then, having passed through it, I insert it again into this same edge of the fascia from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into its other edge from inside to outside, then, as you pass it through, also pass it through the layer of fascia in his direction until it penetrates entirely.
Then, begin again from this same side, following the edge that is against the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out through the skin next to it, then insert it again into that skin, and return it along the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, in accordance with this edge of fascia.
Bring the needle out through the skin on his side, and repeat this process several times until you have sewn the entire wound in a manner similar to how a furrier sews leather. The overall nature of this sewing is like stitching fur with leather.
By sewing the peritoneum once on one side with the edge of the skin and leaving it open on the other side until it is emptied, and as for the second type of stitching, which Galen also mentioned, this is his words verbatim.
And it is that you sew it as the healers do, by gathering each part to its natural counterpart, joining the edge of the peritoneum to the other and the edges of the drains to the other, all as I have described.
The needle should be pierced in the edge of the drain close to you from outside and pushed through alone into the inside, leaving the edges of the peritoneum intact. Then bring the needle back out from outside to inside through both edges of the peritoneum, and also bring it back.
Push the needle from inside to outside through the edge of the drain on the opposite side, and this type of stitching is better than the common, simple stitching that is mentioned, as Galen said verbatim. Some have even suggested that a stomach stitch can be done with just two needles. And this is done by threading one needle and beginning to insert the needle from your side, pushing it through to the other side, and then inserting the other needle from the opposite side, pulling it through according to the stitching of the ascites, just as with any other stitch.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the belly, sewing it will be more difficult than other places on the belly. As for treating the wound, its treatment is like other wounds, for if you succeed in reaching the wound while it is fresh with its blood before the air changes it and return the intestines to their place and sew them up tightly, then apply hot iron needles.
If the wound has been changed by air, apply some ointments to it that you prepare, until it suppures and the stitches fall out, and the peritoneum and omentum heal, then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have any remedies, apply cotton wool that has been steeped in pus and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals. In most cases, if the wounds are simple, you will not need further treatment. However, if you fear that the wound might affect vital organs and cause pain, be cautious.
You should dip soft lint in moderately warm oil or rose fat and apply it around the areas between the ribs and armpits. If there is any pain or foul odor from the intestines, this often indicates a problem, so inject a warm, black, constricting drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and it becomes an open wound inside the body, know that what was thick in the intestines heals more easily, while what was thin is harder to heal.
And as for the intestine, known as the colon, it does not heal from surgery at all, due to the abundance of its vessels, their greatness, and the delicacy of its substance, and its nearness to nerve nature. If, however, what emerged from the wound is still fresh, return it to its place, as with the intestine.
If it has passed some time and it has turned green or black, you should tighten it with a thread over the place that turned black to prevent bleeding, for in the wound there are vessels and arteries, then cut what is below that bond.
You should make both ends of the thread attached from below the surgery, extending it outside to facilitate its removal when the wound discharge and the wound suppuration, mentioning the wound that occurs in the intestine. If there is a tear in the intestine, small in size.
It may happen that in some people, as I saw a man who had been pierced in the abdomen with a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, I delayed treating it, becoming a fistula from which feces and gas emerged, so I treated him as if I did not expect a cure. I continued to soothe it until it healed and the wound was closed. When I saw that the wound had healed, I feared for the patient, lest something bad happen to him in his body, but nothing bad happened to him from that, and he remained in the best condition. Correctly, he should eat, drink, have sexual relations, and take a bath while being served in his condition. Some experienced people have stated that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be sutured accordingly.
And it is to take the larger ants, open their mouths, and place them on both lips of the wound. If they grasp it and tighten their jaws, their head will be cut off, but their body remains stuck and does not come loose, then another ant is placed next to the first one.
And this should be done with several ants, in accordance with the size of the wound, then it should be covered and sutured. These ant heads remain stuck to the intestine until it heals completely, without causing any harm to the patient, and even thin thread can be used to suture the intestine.
Which is to take a thread from the adherent intestinal tissue, insert it into an needle, and when pulled, it will come out smoothly. Then, a fine cotton thread is tied at its end, and this thread is inserted back into the needle. And the thread of the intestine is used to suture it, then it is returned to its place in the body. This method of suturing with ants and intestines is done for the sake of greed and hope.
However, if the wound is large and wide, especially in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy or cure at all.
Chapter LXXVIII.
In the treatment of the common cold and nasal polyps.
Know that every wound or lump, if it persists and becomes a chronic ulcer that does not heal and continuously produces pus, is generally called a fistula in any part of the body, and we call it a cold (common cold) and a nasal polyp.
It is, in truth, a complex, solid, white lump with no pain, having a hollow space like the feathers of a bird.
Some have therefore named it a feather, and it can sometimes be moist, continuously producing pus, and at times the moisture may cease. It can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
In the classification when discussing wounds, it has been stated that every ulcer that does not heal and does not allow tissue regeneration is due to one of nine reasons: either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside or on the edges that prevents healthy tissue from growing. Either because the ulcer is severe and filled with filth, or because it is itself putrid and the material it produces is of poor quality, or because the treatment is inappropriate, or due to a corruption in the town from a plague-like illness, or because of a special condition in the town.
Either because the ulcer is severe and filled with filth, or because it is itself putrid and the material it produces is of poor quality, or because the treatment is inappropriate, or due to a corruption in the town from a plague-like illness, or because of a special condition in the town. As demonstrated in the city of Saragossa, where the progression of diseases is slow and the healing of tumors is difficult, either due to the presence of one or several bones, I have explained all these causes, their symptoms, and treatments with drugs in the preceding section.
Here, I should introduce you to the treatment of fistulas and rhinitis that is done by manual manipulation. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some terminate in large veins and arteries or in a nerve.
or to the peritoneum, or the colon, or the bladder, or a rib, or a vertebra of the spine, or a joint of a composite joint such as the hand or foot, and some terminate near a major organ, among other places.
As for these fistulas with such characteristics, they are among the most difficult diseases to cure and require a great deal of effort and knowledge. If there are any fistulas that have not reached the places mentioned, where treatment is hoped for, then there is still potential for healing.
And in order to understand this, take a probe of copper or iron, if the fistula runs straight, use it to examine it. If there is a curve in the fistula, use a thin lead probe, as lead softens its form.
When the intestine enters and turns towards a bend, if the fistula has multiple openings and you cannot locate them with a probe, inject one of its openings with moisture, as the moisture will flow towards the other openings and discharge.
Then, conduct a thorough examination to determine if there is any bone or nerve, or if the fistula's depth is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Assess all this within your ability of inquiry and by observing the patient's discomfort when you touch the area.
And similarly, consider all the signs and causes of the tumor. If you have accurately determined these factors, then proceed with treatment confidently, observing: if it is...
If the fistula appears close to or in a healthy place away from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places mentioned earlier, cut the fistula as described above and remove the debris and decaying flesh.
And treat what grows in its opening, whether flesh or a small lump, until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, cut it deeply as much as possible and clean it of all decaying flesh.
Then use cotton swabs soaked in strong medications and insert them into the fistula's depth, which you have reached with the iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medication has consumed all the decay remaining at the fistula's bottom.
Then, force it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh until it heals. If it does not heal thereby, cut it as described previously, if the cause of the fistula is bone and this is confirmed by you, examine it and make an incision as I have told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a sweat gland, nerve, or vital organ as we have mentioned, and the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackening, remove it until the corruption disappears, then treat it with what binds and heals it until it recovers, if it does not heal and pus continues as before.
Be aware that you may not have removed all of the corrupt matter, so expose it again and thoroughly investigate its removal and purification with all your effort, then treat it. If it heals, otherwise, know that this corruption is deep and far from the surface, so expose it again.
Thoroughly investigate its removal and purification with all your effort. If the corrupt bone is a small bone that can be pulled, use delicate claws suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly investigate the removal of all of them without leaving anything behind. If something prevents you from doing so, such as a ligament, and cutting it poses no danger, then cut these ligaments and flesh, and save the bones.
If you are unable to extract the bones, then apply something to the wound that will preserve it and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones rot. Keep the wound clean so that the gap you made during your work does not heal.
If you are concerned about this, apply a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian paste or one of the green pastes; if these ligaments rot and the bones become soft, it will be easy to remove and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, such as the shinbone or thighbone, and only its outer surface has deteriorated, carefully remove the decayed portion until the blackening and corruption disappear, then close the wound. However, if a significant part has deteriorated and the corruption has reached the interior of the bone, it must be split open.
Cut it all the way to where the decay ends, and then treat it until it heals. I will tell you about a case that occurred to a man in his leg to serve as an example and help you with your treatment; this man was young.
Around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to something moving inside the body, causing inflammation and a large swelling that was not due to anything external. The passage of time, combined with the mistakes of doctors, led to the opening of the abscess.
Many complications arose from his condition and he was mismanaged, leading to gangrene in the leg with multiple abscesses discharging pus and bodily fluids. It was treated by a group of physicians for approximately two years, but none of them were skilled in manual surgery.
I then examined his leg, where a great deal of pus was flowing from these abscesses, and the man's body had wasted away, his skin having turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of the abscesses, which led to the bone, so I examined all of them.
I found that they opened into each other on all sides of the leg, so I incised one of the abscesses to expose some of the bone, which was rotten, having been eaten away and turned black and putrid, with a hole drilled through to the marrow, which I cleaned.
I extracted the rotten bone, and I believe that was all the decay in the bone, which I cut out and spread open. Then I treated the wound with healing medications to hold it together for a longer time, but it did not heal. So I opened it again to examine the bone once more.
I found that the decay was connected to the bone, so I spread it open again and exposed more of the rotten parts. I tried to force it together, but it did not heal or fuse. I then reopened it and continued to cut away at the bone, piece by piece, attempting to repair it, until I had removed approximately a palm's length of bone.
He removed the foreign body with his tongue, then bound it with drugs, and it healed quickly. This repetition was necessary in his treatment due to the patient's weakness, lack of resilience, and the risk of death, as he suffered from a weak consciousness due to excessive vomiting.
And as the flesh grew in the place of the bone, it became strong and its condition improved in his body, and his strength returned, and his condition changed for the better, without any further harm from walking, especially if a bone had fractured in that location.
It should be done in this manner, taking a bandage and tightening it around the newly formed bone, then commanding someone to stretch it upwards, creating another bandage made of thicker wool than the first one.
Then, bind it to the flesh beneath the bone, extending its tip to pull the flesh downward, while exposing the area you intend to cut, ensuring not to harm the flesh with the saw. Place a wooden block or board beneath the bone for a secure support.
Because if you do this, the saw will not hesitate to cut through the rotten bone. The cut should be slightly above the area of rot to prevent further damage to the bone's interior, ensuring that no hidden rot remains unseen and requiring another round of treatment.
If the bone is rotten and not separated, but connected in the middle or in some parts, then remove the flesh from all sides, and place a wooden splint from below, and spread it from the first side where the rot is.
After you have spread it from one side, spread it from the other side, a little away from the rot, as we mentioned. If the rot is in a joint, then cut off the rotten joint itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the rot is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but to remove it. If the rot is in the hand or foot phalanges, the treatment is very difficult, but you should peel off the rot as it appears to you and strip it and clean it in any way possible.
By what means can you make it straight when a vessel or nerve does not prevent you? Note that there are many saws and chisels to cut these bones, according to their position, placement, thickness, thinness, hardness, porosity, size, and sharpness. Therefore, you should prepare for each type of work a tool suitable for that work.
Know that the work itself may indicate the type of tool you need, if you have a long-standing experience and knowledge of these arts. For he who is skilled in this craft and has witnessed various forms of illness, will know what tools to use. One may deduce for themselves similar instruments for every disease, and I have illustrated several instruments at the end of this door.
Make them examples to be emulated and measurements to compare others against, God willing, an image of a saw:

Chapter 78
In amputation procedures and the reduction of fractured bones.
The extremities may become gangrenous either from a cause external or internal. If this corruption is treated with drugs but does not improve and you see the corruption spreading throughout the member, nothing will stop it.
It is necessary to cut off the member as far as the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved from death or from a great calamity greater than the loss of the member. A sign that this condition has occurred is when the member turns black as if it had been burned by fire.
After the blackening, gangrene may set in and spread to other parts of the body, so hurry to cut it off. Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the bite of certain creatures such as a sea scorpion, snake, or spider, etc.
If the corruption or bite is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand. Similarly, if it has affected the hand, cut it at the wrist and do not allow the corruption to spread further until it reaches the forearm.
Similarly, if it affects the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself. If the corruption persists and you see it spreading towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder, as this would lead to the patient's death. Instead, use other treatments within your ability.
Similarly, if the corruption affects a toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints. If it spreads to the sole of the foot, cut off the entire foot, but if it reaches the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and hand over the patient to death; the treatment for amputation or dismemberment is to tie a ligature below the desired point of amputation and another ligature above it.
The server ties one ligature below and another above, and you use a wide knife to remove the flesh between them, exposing it entirely. Then, it is either cut or divided, and cloth should be placed on all sides.
To avoid the saw affecting the correct area, causing additional pain and a hot swelling for the patient; if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly apply pressure to the site or place some sharp objects to stop the bleeding, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then, tie the injured member with a suitable ligature and treat it until it heals; I will inform you of an example that occurred to a man in his foot, this very condition that I describe, where a blackening accompanied by burning, similar to fire, occurred in his foot.
That corruption began in his finger, spreading to the entire foot; driven by the pain and burning he was experiencing, the man himself decided to amputate it at the joint, and it healed.
After a long time had passed, the same corruption appeared in his ring finger, so he sought my help. I tried to prevent it with the medications I applied to the hand after cleaning his body, but the corruption did not desist and spread to the other finger.
He then asked for his hand to be amputated, but I refused, pleading for mercy and fearing for his life upon cutting off his limb, as his strength relied on movement. When he despaired of my help, he returned to his hometown.
I heard that he had his hand amputated at the wrist, and it healed. I relate this story to serve as a help in cases of this disease and as a guide for treatment.
Chapter LXXVIII.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medication.
If a tumor forms in any fleshy organ and it persists for a prolonged period, eventually rupturing or drying up and expelling all its contents, leaving the site empty as if it were a vessel.
The skin covering it is like a cloth, soft and not yet completely corrupted; it does not affect the bone, nerve, or ligament. Hence, it is aptly called an abscess, not a fistula, unless its duration extends to the point where corruption influences any of these members.
When this occurs, it is called a fistula or an ulcer, and its treatment is to cut off all that skin as it circles around, especially if it has become thin and papery, and you are certain that it does not adhere to the wound due to its decomposition.
If the skin adheres and it has not yet reached the point of decomposition, but there is still thickness of flesh, treat it with a suppuration, which means to observe the abscess. If it is large and the pus that extends from it has an unpleasant odour, then inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, honey, and ginger in equal parts, cooked over fire until the medicine thickens like honey, then take as much as needed, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess, seal its mouth, and leave the medicine for about two hours.
Then, remove it with a press, repeating this process for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odour disappears. If this medicine is not available, you can use water mixed with ash from date palm or oak wood.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been cleansed. If there is no improvement with these medicines, then inject a mixture of water and honey with some powdered ginger.
Or inject honey and a mixture of drinks, for honey purifies and washes, while the drink adheres to the wound, especially if it contains residual contraction and drying. If you do this repeatedly and ensure that the wound's corruption has gone, then inject what promotes the growth of flesh.
For example, you might take a mixture of myrrh ointment with rose fat and a contracting drink, or inject it with other drugs and ointments whose properties we have established in the article on ointments; if the wound's opening is narrow, it may not accommodate the syringe.
If the opening is too narrow, expand it slightly with iron, or insert a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or syrion ointment to widen it. If the opening is also wide, sew its edges together and leave enough space for the syringe to fit without excess.
Similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated, make a cut in the lowest part to allow the pus to drain downward, as pus trapped within the wound's depths can prevent the growth of flesh.
If you cannot make a cut in the wound to allow pus to drain downward as desired, then use a device that facilitates the easy drainage of pus, ensuring nothing remains within the wound.
And as for the healing drugs that are applied to the wound from outside, and how they should be applied, it is to take one of the cohesive plasters suitable for what you want and extend it over a piece of linen cloth, so that the cloth covers the entire wound. Then, using scissors, make a hole in front of the wound, slightly wider than the opening of the wound, and apply soft plasters to another piece of linen cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place them on top, keeping them distant from the wound's opening to facilitate the discharge of pus. Remove the large cloth only after a while.
For several days, it is the plasters over the wound's opening that you remove at regular intervals to allow the pus to drain and to observe the discharge of purulent fluid, whether it is abundant or scarce, mature or immature.
Additionally, examine the site of the wound to see if the patient feels any pain, and if there is swelling or none. If you continue treatment in this manner and observe a small discharge from the wound's opening, the material should be examined for signs of healing.
Know that if the wound has adhered or nearly adhered, then dissolve it on the following day or the third day. When you clean the wound, replace the cloth with a new one and apply fresh plaster. If after some time a thin pus is discharged, do not despair; the wound will eventually heal.
Its healing is swift because some people's flesh heals slowly from their wounds, while others heal quickly. If after many days a non-matured pus drains out, know that the wound has not healed, for its closure was delayed.
If the condition persists, increase the use of dry drugs while maintaining a balanced moisture level, similar to the consistency of nashli (almond) paste if it is enriched with an additional portion of qulqatar (a traditional medicine). The most effective treatment is to use the nashli paste.
Apply rose oil, sprinkle it with a moderate amount of ancient drink (a traditional remedy), mix well and use it. If you don't have nashli (almond) paste, you can use honey if boiled until thick, or mix powdered myrrh, sapper (gargarism), and galangal, crush them all, and sprinkle the mixture over honey while heating it. Then, apply it to a cloth, secure it over the wound, or coat it with thickened honey, sprinkle drugs on top, cover it with a cloth, and secure it tightly.
In such cases, you can use long ziraun (a medicinal plant), the root of iris (susu'n al-asmanji), fennel flour, or hellebore, either alone or mixed, crush and sieve them, and sprinkle this mixture over the honey described earlier, then apply it. If the wound persists after this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
And if it affects the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, its treatment is similar to that of fistulas, as mentioned previously.
Chapter Eighty-Nine
In the treatment of corns, softened nails, amputation of a surplus toe, and incision of fused fingers.
A corn is a thick piece of flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb or any other finger, and it may also grow on other parts of the fingers. If left untreated for a long time, it becomes swollen and forms a hot lump.
It corrupts and softens until it consumes the nail root, and it may even destroy the entire nail. The corruption may reach the bone, emitting a foul odor, and the finger tip becomes wide and black, and if you treat it as mentioned in the previous sections without success.
You should cut off all the protruding parts of the nail with iron, and then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization is very beneficial in this case. If the bone is intact and so is the nail,
And the corner of the nail, which buries itself into the flesh, should be treated with a thin rod placed under the corner to raise it and cut off the embedded flesh gently.
Apply burning, corroding drugs to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat with ointments until it heals. If the corruption has affected the bone, it should be cut and removed; for it will never heal as long as any rotten bone remains.
If you see decay and corruption spreading in a finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as mentioned previously, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is injured or crushed and causes severe pain, first drain the blood from the wound.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, make an oblique cut in the nail from top to bottom, taking care not to reach the flesh beneath. This will cause severe pain for the patient and may lead to excessive tissue growth at the site. Treat the area with something to alleviate the pain.
As for the excess finger that some people are born with, it may be entirely flesh or have bones in it, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow from the base of a joint between fingers.
It may be that the growth originates in some of the phalanges and does not move, or it moves at the joint where it grows from a finger. If it is purely flesh, cut it off at its base with a wide scalpel.
And as for the growths that originate within the joint, their treatment is difficult, so one should avoid cutting them. As for those that grow on the finger at one of the phalanges, they should be cut first by removing their flesh in a round manner towards the bone, then the bone should be split using one of those saws suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the fusion that occurs between fingers, it often happens and is usually a condition present from birth, or it may occur due to wound healing or a burn or something similar, and in this case, one should break up that fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a thread or a small hole soaked in rose oil to prevent quick fusion and separation, or use a thin lead sheet between them until the wound heals as it should.
And likewise, if fusion occurs between some fingers and the palm, break up that fusion according to what is suitable and corrects the form of the member.
Chapter Ninety.
On the cutting of veins.
The veins are twisted, thick vessels filled with excess black blood and occur most frequently in the body's extremities, especially in the legs, particularly at the joints and where weight is borne. Therefore, one should first use vigorous friction to remove the black crusts from the skin.
Then, the surgeon should incise the abscess and, for its treatment with iron, there are two methods: one is to puncture and drain the black blood, and the other is to let the sweat flow out completely. The incision should be made in this manner so that the leg first absorbs the hot water nicely.
Until the thick, cloudy blood dissolves, then tighten the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and puncture the sweat gland in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then, with your hand, drain the black blood from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until you extract what you consider sufficient or as much as the patient's strength allows. Then bind it and instruct them to avoid foods that produce black bile, and repeat vomiting and fomentation.
When the veins are filled and this causes harm to the patient, then pouring sweat can be achieved by shaving the patient's leg if it has a lot of hair, then immersing it in hot water or subjecting it to intense physical exercise until it turns red and sweats profusely.
If a bath is not available to heat the member, then puncture the skin next to the sweat gland with a knife, either lengthwise at the knee or lower down at the ankle, and open the skin with pliers, peeling away the sweat gland from all sides until it can be felt.
When it appears, you will see it red and pulsating; if you separate it from the skin, it looks like a string. Then, insert a knife beneath it until it rises and detaches from the skin. Hang it on a smooth, blind hook, then make another cut nearby, approximately the length of three fingers.
Then, remove the skin from the sweat gland, exposing it. Lift it with a knife as before and hang it on another hook. Then make additional cuts or multiple cuts if needed.
Then, cut and remove it at the end of the cut near the heel. Pull and lift it until it comes out of the second cut, then pull it towards the cut above, doing this until you have pulled it from the third cut, which is the highest among all the cuts. Once it has been completely removed, cut it.
If it does not come out when pulled and lifted, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Then, place the knife beneath it and twist your hand to the sides until it comes out. Be careful not to let it break, as it will be difficult to remove if it does.
It is then inserted into the affected area, and if all of it is removed, apply a poultice dipped in a drink or oil and rose fat to the wounds until healing occurs. If the growth is twisted and has folds with bends in different directions.
And if it is not straight, as we have said, you should make incisions along each bend and in the places where it twists, then attach it with hooks until you have grasped all of it, and be careful when making incisions to avoid cutting the vein or injuring it, for it will be difficult to extract, so take care.
Image of the splint used to cut through the wooden beam.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a curved shape like other hooks, and its end should not be sharp to avoid injuring the vein; instead, it should be thick and flexible, smooth in texture. If it is too thin, it may cut the vein due to its sharpness.
Chapter 91.
In the extraction of the superficial vein.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries such as Hijaz and Arab lands, as well as in arid, infertile regions with scarce rainfall, and occasionally in other parts of the body, not just the legs, due to putrefaction occurring beneath the skin.
As in living bodies, worms and insects may occur within the skin and flesh, it is necessary to probe and remove the worm generated between the skin and muscle. The onset of this condition is marked by a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by a discharge from the affected area, after which the sweating begins.
If a part of the root or stem of a plant or an animal appears, it should be wrapped in a small piece of lead weighing between one and two dirhams, tied tightly, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything protrudes from the wound, wrap it in lead and tie it tightly. If it takes a long time to heal, cut off a part of it and wrap the rest, but do not cut the entire wound from its root before it has completely healed; otherwise, it may contract and enter the flesh, causing a lump, putrefaction, and a bad ulcer.
For this reason, it should be managed and drawn out little by little until the last bit is expelled from the body, and in some people, this worm can be as long as five or ten hand spans.
I have heard that in one case, a worm measuring twenty hand spans emerged from a patient. If it breaks off during treatment, insert a rod into its hole and wrap it tightly with bandages for an extended period, allowing the body to expel all its contents; and treat the wound with medicines for several days.
Then he treats it with tumor therapy, and this sweat may have many branches, especially if it appears in the knee joint or in the leg itself, causing multiple openings, and each opening has a branch that should be treated as we mentioned in the classification and as previously stated.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
In the fissure, on the worm generated under the skin, called the cattle disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the "Cattle Disease" because it often affects cattle, and it is a small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, moving up and down throughout the body.
It is perceived by touch when it moves from one organ to another until it breaches the skin at a certain point and exits, forming abscesses due to the putrefaction of certain humors, as occurs with worms, snakes, and swelling in the stomach.
And it is expected that its harm comes from when it moves in the body and rises to the head, reaching the eye, where it might open it up and exit, rendering the eye useless, and this occurs frequently. If one wishes to treat and remove it, it can only be done when it is moving and perceptible by touch.
It is necessary to tighten what is above and below it with a strong ligature, then make an incision on it and extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, carry out the cauterization of the place with fire until it burns, for the greatest danger of damaging the eye lies in this, as we have said.
If you see it has moved to the head near the eye, tighten under it on the forehead tightly then make an incision and extract it. The patient should also purify their body with drugs that facilitate the elimination of putrid humors and guard against foods that cause putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On the incision for the condition known as 'naphur'.
The condition known as 'naufur' in our country is a pain that occurs in certain members and then transfers from one member to another, and I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in a certain desert, so I examined her arm and saw a slight swelling in the veins of the forearm. After an hour, I observed that swelling spreading along the arm towards her elbow with great speed, like mercury.
If the pain shifts from one location to another, it disappears from the first place and settles in the shoulder, after which I sat for an hour and it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that her entire body was rotating as I observed.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one organ to another, and I had never before seen this disease in such a way or to such an extent, except that I had observed a group of people experiencing pain shifting from one part of the body to another, but not to the same degree as I witnessed in this woman.
I initially thought that this could only be due to the woman being from a desert region, with a dry body and visible veins, which allowed the sensation of the moving air and pain to manifest in such a way. By contrast, these symptoms would not appear in people living in comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If one wishes to treat this condition and the patient feels pain, one should immediately apply pressure above and below the affected area using a wheel, and slice into it gently until the trapped air is released. Then, dress the wound.
If you do not see the condition, treat it by purging the body and expelling winds with methods such as using aromatic herbs or similar medications.
Chapter 94.
In Removing Arrows
Arrows may vary according to their types and the positions they occupy in the body. As for their variation by type, there are large and small arrows, hollow and solid glass arrows, and those with three or four angles.
Some arrows have blades and others have shards. As for their variation according to the members they enter, they fall into two categories: either the members are vital, hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, etc., or they are non-vital members. If an arrow enters one of these members and the signs of death that I am describing appear, it is advisable to refrain from removing that arrow, as death usually follows in most cases. If the bad signs do not appear and the arrow does not become lodged in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. If the brain is struck by an arrow that pierces the bone and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, severe headaches, dizziness, and vertigo may occur.
If the bad signs do not appear and the arrow does not become lodged in the organ, remove it and treat the wound. If the brain is struck by an arrow that pierces the bone and injures the peritoneum covering the brain, severe headaches, dizziness, and vertigo may occur. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, spasms, mental confusion, repeated vomiting, bleeding from the nose or ears, loss of speech, and discharge of white, mucous-like fluid from the wound, resembling porridge, are all signs to look out for.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and extracting the arrow if it has not been ejected. As for the sign of the arrow striking the heart, if it is close to the left breast and can be felt as if it were embedded in a solid object rather than in empty space.
If the arrow's movement resembles a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by numbness of the limbs and cold sweat, know that death is inevitable. If the arrow wounds the lung, frothy blood will exit from the wound.
If the vessels near the neck swell, and the patient's complexion changes, and they breathe heavily, seeking cold air, then the arrow has penetrated the pleura in the chest, close to the small ribs, causing severe pain and deep breathing.
The patient will sigh, and all the muscles around the ribcage will spasm. If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the color of the liver exits from the wound. If the arrow hits the stomach, something undigested may exit from the wound.
The case is desperate. If the arrow strikes the abdomen, becomes lodged there, and exits through a wound or rupture in the intestine, no treatment can be expected, nor can the arrow be extracted. However, if the arrow pierces the bladder and allows urine to exit, there may be hope.
If a part protrudes from the body and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is doomed. As for the rest of the members, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, back spine, scapula, thigh, leg, and similar members, they may recover in most cases.
When an arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, and I tell you about some of what I have seen regarding these arrows so that you can draw conclusions for your treatment, for example, a man was hit by an arrow in the eye socket at the root of his nose.
He removed it from the other side, under the ear lobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye. I also removed another arrow that had struck a Jew in the eyelid, below the lower lid, and the arrow had retreated, leaving only its small tip embedded in the wood.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, made of smooth, iron-squared wood without ears, and the Jew recovered without any eye complications. I also removed another arrow from a Christian's throat; it was an Arab arrow.
It had two ears, so I cut it between the clavicles, as it had sunk into his throat. I carefully removed it, and the Christian recovered. I also extracted another arrow from a man's belly; we thought he would die from it.
When the arrow had remained embedded for about thirty days without any change in its condition, I incised around it and removed it, and he healed without any subsequent complications. I also observed a man with an arrow through his back, which had healed over without further issues.
After seven years, the arrow emerged from the hip joint. I also observed a woman with an arrow in her stomach; the wound healed over, and the arrow remained without causing any harm to her natural activities.
I also observed another man with an arrow in his face, which healed well and caused him little pain. There are many similar cases. I removed an arrow from a high-ranking official of the sultan, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, slightly deviating to the right.
The arrow had completely exited, and I was called to treat it three days after the injury. Upon examination, I found the wound around the arrow very narrow. Using a thin probe, I felt no presence of the arrow, but the patient experienced prickling and pain under his right ear where the wound was located.
I presumed that the prickling sensation was due to the arrow's tip, so I applied a compress with strong adhesive properties, hoping that the swelling would increase at the site and reveal the arrow's position. However, no incident occurred, and there were no signs that the arrow had reached the site.
I continued to apply the bandage for many days without any complications, and during this time, the wound healed, leaving the patient desperate to have it removed for a prolonged period. Until one day, he felt an arrow inside his nose, so I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days.
Until it opened and I could see inside, feeling the fine tip of the arrow attached to the wood. Then, I continued to open the wound with that sharp medicine until the arrow's end became visible, and it took me several months, around four, to remove it.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert hooks into it, I pulled and manipulated them, but they wouldn't come out. So, I continued to manipulate and use various tools until one day, I managed to grab them with firm hooks, as shown in the final section of this book.
And the doctors used to judge that his nose cartilage would not heal, but I managed to mend it, and the wound healed completely, leaving no further issues. And I will tell you how to remove some arrows, which can serve as a reference for what I have not mentioned.
For the parts of this craft and its details cannot be described in words nor fully understood by any book. Instead, the skilled craftsman measures little by much, relates what is present to what is absent, and innovates new work and tools during unforeseen circumstances.
If one departs from this art, I say that arrows leave the body from the members in which they have become lodged in two ways: either by being drawn away from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side. They exit as they entered.
If the arrow is protruding in a inflamed area, it should be drawn out; if it does not come out easily, one should leave it for several days until the flesh around it rots, making it easier to draw and remove, especially if it has become lodged in a bone.
If it does not come out after a few days, one should also leave it for some time and then try to draw and move it daily; it will eventually come out. If it still does not leave after several days, one should drill around the arrow in the same bone with a delicate awl on all sides to expand the space for the arrow, and then draw and remove it.
If the arrow that is lodged in the skull has penetrated deeply into one of the brain's cavities and symptoms from the condition previously mentioned appear, do not try to draw out the arrow; instead, leave it until later, allowing the patient time to recover.
In dealing with an arrow that is embedded and needs to be removed, if it is deeply embedded and does not come out upon pulling, use the borers around the arrow as described, then treat the site until it heals. If, however, the arrow has withdrawn into a part of the body. If sensation is absent, examine it with a probe. If you feel it, draw it out with suitable instruments for drawing it. If you cannot do this because the wound is narrow and the arrow is deeply embedded, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, consider other methods.
Make a cut until the wound widens and you can grasp the arrow, then extract it. If it has ears (i.e., is embedded in tissue), free the flesh adhering to it from all sides using any means possible. If you cannot do this without breaking the ears, break them and remove the arrow.
If you attempt to extract the arrow from any part, use your hand with pliers in all directions until you free it. Handle it gently to avoid breaking the arrow, as this would make extraction more difficult. If you cannot do this within your time frame.
Leave it for several days until the flesh around it decays, then treat it again. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in its section. Be careful not to cut any veins, nerves, or tendons, and use whatever means necessary.
By any means, you can extract the arrow, doing so gently and with caution, as described to you, and when pulling out the arrow, you should put the patient in a position similar to that when the arrow entered, for this is more beneficial.
If you cannot do this, use what you can of the shapes, and as for the arrow that exits from the opposite side, either something has protruded from it to the outside, or you find the end of the arrow by touch close to the skin and see it emerging.
Make a cut on it, as much as the claws will allow, then pull it out, for it will be easier to leave. If it sticks to a bone, twist your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and makes space for itself, then pull it out.
If it does not come out, leave it for several days until it does. If the arrowhead is still inside, push it with a similar arrowhead, or use an empty tool to enter the shaft of the arrow and then push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with a tool that fits inside it; this will make the arrow come out more easily. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cut away the flesh affected by the poison if possible, then treat the wound accordingly.
If the arrow has penetrated the chest, or abdomen, or bladder, or ribcage and is close to what can be felt with a probe, then make an incision and be careful not to cut any blood vessels or nerves as you remove it.
Then trace the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals, illustration of the hooks that attract the arrows:
Its ends are shaped like a bird's beak, as if it were a file, if you grasp an arrow or something similar, and they can be made in various sizes—large, medium, and small—depending on the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Illustration of the concave gun:
Illustration of the solid gun:
This is solid at the end, like a wedge, to facilitate entry into the concave arrow and its expulsion:
Chapter 95
On the tourniquet (for veins):
The thirty arteries that are usually severed in the body, sixteen of which are in the head: the two pulsing arteries behind the ears, known as the sensitives; and the two arteries on the temples, visible; and the two arteries at the base of the eyes, known as the lookers.
And the artery standing in the middle of the forehead, and the one at the tip of the nose, and the jugulars in the neck, and the two arteries on the upper lip inside the mouth, and the two arteries on the lower lip, known as the "jharak", and the two arteries under the tongue.
As for the arteries that are severed in the arm and hand, there are five: one is the cephalic, which is on the lateral side, commonly known as the head's artery; the axillary, which is in the middle, composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, commonly known as the body's artery.
The basilic, which is located on the inner side and is also known as the axillary; commonly known as the abdominal artery, and the tendon of the arm, appearing clearly above the thumb, and the median nerve.
This is the artery between the ring and middle fingers, with two branches; in the leg and foot, there are three: one beneath the kneecap on the lateral side, the second (is) the tibial, located at the heel on the inner side, and the third (is) the sciatic nerve, situated behind the ankle on the lateral side.
In the other leg, there are three blood vessels similar to these, and the two behind the ears are beneficial for cutting them in chronic effusions, migraines, dandruff, and persistent head sores, in the manner I will describe.
And [you should] shave the head of the patient, and rub a coarse cloth behind his neck in the area of the veins; then strangle the patient's neck with a turban until the veins appear, and their location is behind the ears at the lower points of the head; inspect them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark them with ink.
Then take a scalpel, the one known as the dissection knife, and insert it under the vein into the skin until the blade reaches the bone; then lift your hand with the vein and skin above it and cut the vein with the skin in an amputated cut, with a length of two joined fingers.
Or, in its place, you can tie them off with ligatures and leave them until healing occurs; as I have previously described in the first part of this book, how to cut and bind them. As for the two arteries in the temples, their cutting is beneficial for chronic migraines, persistent headaches, constant eye watering, and sudden flows of clear fluid to the eyes.
And the method of cutting them, as I describe, have the patient tighten his neck with a turban until the veins become clearly visible and you can feel their pulse beneath your finger; then mark them with ink. Then, lift the skin from above the vein upwards using your index finger.
The surgical knife should be inserted from below, lifting the vein upwards and severing it as you did with the other veins. You may release some blood as needed, then loosen the patient's bandage and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then, apply a cotton ball and a bandage, tightly securing it from above, and leave it until it heals. You have previously discussed the preparation, cutting, and use of these materials at the beginning of the book. As for phlebotomy of the frontal vein, its benefit follows phlebotomy of the temporal vein for chronic facial ailments such as tinea, ulcers, and erythema.
The procedure for phlebotomy involves constricting the patient's neck with a turban until the vein becomes visible. Then, take the instrument called the 'axe' (as depicted), and perform the incision.
Place the resulting hook at the top of the axe on the same vein and strike it from above with a comb or any other tool in its direction, allowing blood to flow as desired. Then, loosen the patient's constriction and secure it until healing is complete.
A wide knife may be used, but it should not be as sharp as other knives; rather, the blade should be slightly wider and more rounded to avoid breaking if it strikes a bone, as bones are close by.
On the bleeding in the region of the eyes: Its benefit for eye ailments, including scabies, redness, discharge, and facial diseases. As for how to drain it, the patient should tighten his neck with a turban, then you drain them while standing over his head, slightly bending the head towards the length, using a small, slightly wide blade.
If the area has no flesh, and if the blade is thin, it may break, then you will have sufficient blood let down, place a cotton on it, tighten it for one night, then release it. Draining the nasal veins is beneficial for high fever.
For severe headaches and facial diseases such as the persistent red rash that appears in the nose, especially if chronic, the method is to have the patient tighten his neck, then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long blade.
You pierce it in the middle of the nose, between the nasal bones, straightening it, as the vein is not felt there, and the blood flows freely. You should carefully use the blade to drain enough blood, then tie it off for the night; it will heal quickly.
As for the lymph nodes, draining them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and dark skin diseases such as vitiligo, scrofula, bad ulcers, and sores. The method is to have the patient tighten them with a band around his neck, and the practitioner stands on the patient's head.
The sick person should be seated, then perspiration appears along the body in a wide, slightly spreading manner, then blood oozes out in the appropriate amount or as needed, then do the same for the other sweat, and then loosen the bandage.
Additionally, you should gently tighten the sweat glands to prevent the patient from choking and leave it for the next day, as this will heal the wound. As for the jaw veins, their drainage after draining the lymph nodes is beneficial for teeth abscesses, gum deterioration, bad ulcers, and splits in the lips.
Which are located in the nose and around it, and how to drain them: you should have the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a turban, turn their lips, and look at the sweat glands, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, to identify them by their color.
This is also because around them are thin, black veins that you should cut off completely. If it is unclear to you, aim to cut the largest and most prominent ones, and do the same for the sweat glands located on the lower lip.
As for the sweat glands under the tongue, draining them after draining the lymph nodes is beneficial for phlegm in the throat and mouth diseases, such as tonsilitis. To drain them, have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under it on one side and then the other to identify the sweat glands, which should be black in color.
Dissect them carefully and preserve them, do not cut them excessively as there are arteries beneath that may cause bleeding. The three veins that are dissected in the elbow joint are those commonly cut in all people, and their dissection can be performed in two ways.
Either stitch with a wide, curved scissor or use an olive-shaped scissor to the tendon (as shown), or make a cut with a thin, straight scissor, which is called 'nasl' [and this is its image]: an illustration of the wide, curved scissor.
It should be wide as you see, suitable for opening hollow veins that are full, prominent, and thick, containing thick, cloudy blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped scissor.
And this scissor is thinner and has a finer tip, suitable for cutting small veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the 'nasl' (thin, straight) scissor.
This 'nasl' (thin, straight scissor) is used for cutting and comes in both wide and thin varieties, depending on the size and thickness of the veins. It can also be used as a reference for others, and it is well-known among artisans.
As for the 'baslic' (one of the three veins), its dissection is beneficial as it draws blood from diseases below the throat and neck, extending to the chest and abdomen. When cutting this vein, the cutter must be cautious and careful, as there may be arteries beneath, and if they make a mistake and cut too much, they will sever that artery.
In case of bleeding, it should not be lanced with a searing instrument, but rather by making an incision with a hook. If the basileus (vein) does not appear clearly, one should avoid it and turn to another or seek some of its branches.
If one lances the place of the arm vein, it becomes clear and should be incised with a searing instrument as we mentioned. If you wish to lance it directly, before tightening the arm, you should feel the spot to identify the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then, bind the arm and make an oblique incision in the vein with a searing instrument as we mentioned, ensuring the cut is away from the artery. When you tighten the bandage, if you see a bulge at the marked spot with ink, that is the artery's swelling, so avoid it.
If you see the blood spurt out when lancing as a young child's urine does, and it is thin red blood, know that it is from an artery. In this case, quickly place your finger on the wound for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often does stop, then tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient not to neglect it, place it on the neck, and do not move it for several days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop, and you are unable to find a remedy in time, cut off the artery if it becomes visible; its ends will shrivel, and the blood will stop.
Take a pistachio shell, split it open, and take one half, then secure it tightly to the sweat gland with ropes and bands until another day. If the blood stops, then treat it as mentioned previously with the use of cauterizing points to stop bleeding. Cutting off the blood is not difficult under most circumstances.
For small wounds where the bandage is secure on the arm, this method is effective. As for the acral sweat gland, lancing it is beneficial as it draws blood from the top of the head and the bottom of the body because it is composed of a branch of basilic vein and a branch of cephalic vein, as we have mentioned.
The person performing the lancing should be aware of the depth of their cut, for if they go too deep and encounter a nerve, the result may be numbness that is difficult to cure and might not heal completely. This nerve is often quite sensitive.
If it is difficult to distinguish in some people and it is thin, you should make your lance a gentle slit and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the sweat gland is between two nerves, cut the gland lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, lancing it is beneficial as it draws blood from the head.
It is also useful for eye diseases, and particularly for this vein, if you want to lance it, use the olive scalpel or the wide rosemary scalpel, as it is the safest of all veins because there is no artery or nerve underneath.
In phlebotomy, one must avoid the tendon's head with the scalpel and seek the soft tissue. It is not harmful if it does not strike the target on the first attempt; however, it may swell in some people if not struck on the initial attempt.
However, this swelling will not harm it, and as for the phlebotomy procedure, its indications, and what should precede it, you must first know that phlebotomy is either used solely to preserve health.
Either it is used in diseases, or to preserve health and sustain it, and to prevent the occurrence of diseases, phlebotomy should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, basilic, or median, and it should be done in early spring if signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours have passed in the morning. However, for phlebotomy used to treat diseases, there is no specific time limit; it can be done at any time of day, night or morning, when needed.
At every hour and in every time, one should not perform phlebotomy on children until they reach the age of 14, nor on elderly people who have surpassed 60 years of age. If someone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason, they should consider this.
It is necessary to clean the intestines with a gentle enema before puncturing, if there is a lot of feces retained, in order not to attract bad odor from the intestines into the veins during puncturing, which would harm the vital organs. Do not puncture those who are drowsy, drunk, or intoxicated until they are sober.
One should also be cautious about puncturing after diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence, excessive sexual activity, exhaustion, exercise, sleeplessness, and fasting, or any other condition that weakens the body or mind. Then, consider diluting the humors before puncturing if the blood is thick.
Through foods, drinks, and medications, if possible, he should then take a bath, unless prevented, or engage in some exercise to thin the blood and schedule his puncturing in the middle of the day as we mentioned, aiming to clear his mind of all negative psychological conditions that day.
Such as worries, anger, fear, and all physical conditions like excessive fatigue, sexual activity, and the like. He should prepare his environment with things that people usually use for relaxation, such as perfumes, incense, entertainment, and so on, to the best of his ability.
Then, the surgeon should sit on a cushion higher than that of the patient. He then extends his arm and has it rubbed by the assistant two or three times, after which he tightens the bandage with the cord, twisting it two or three times, ensuring the tension is moderate.
Because when the tension is either excessive or too lax, it prevents the flow of blood, and then after tension, one should rub the intended area with both hands.
Until the veins bulge and become visible, then the scalpel should be wiped with a small amount of old oil, especially, and then place the index finger of the left hand on the same vein below the desired location to cut it slightly so that it does not escape from the blow. Because some veins are like a tendon that sticks when cut, and some are filled with air. When the scalpel is placed on them, they sink below the scalpel, deceiving the cutter, and if the vein is opened, it is only narrowed.
Therefore, the cutter should be firm and patient in all these matters, then lower the scalpel. If the vein opens at that time, otherwise, he should repeat the process under or above the same location with haste if it does not swell.
If it swells or the patient is disturbed, leave it for a day or two without tightening the bandage, as it may cause a hot tumor. Avoid taking a bath. Then he can repeat the incision if he wishes. If the scalpel was pushed in and there is a small opening with thin blood flow.
I feared that not enough blood would drain, so I reinserted the scalpel into the same wound, applying it with care along a straight line, and increased the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people, even a small incision can cause swelling.
If you see that it has swelled, do not attempt to incise it again, for it will be of no benefit. Apply some oil to it, as it facilitates the flow of blood and is better for this purpose than pure oil or any other fat.
Use oil in all your vein punctures when the blood flow is obstructed, and the remedy of the phlegmasia or the cataplasm can also achieve this, as placing either on the affected area causes the thick blood to thin and dissolve.
If the puncture site becomes greatly swollen, which often happens, especially for those who have only punctured a vein once or if the incision is small, act quickly. Apply a sponge soaked in slightly warm salt water and leave it for an hour; it will dissolve.
You should do this after all blood has drained from the vein or another vessel, and if there remains any blackness or greenness at the site days later, it is of no harm. If you wish, apply a mixture of honey and vinegar.
Do not apply anything of the juice of fındik (pistachio) or similar substances, as it often happens that a swelling and a nodule occur when puncturing the basilic vein. Place your hand on it; if it feels tender when you press it, then this is a bad nodule, so be careful not to apply anything from what we have mentioned.
It may bleed from a artery, so dress it tightly to solidify the area and then treat it with all other remedies until it heals, and each person should remove as much blood as their strength allows, according to the dominant color in the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red; if it appears thick, let it run until it thins; and if it is sharp, allow it to diminish its sharpness. For one who is robust and needs to have a large amount of blood drawn at once, this should be done.
It should open the sweat vein widely and the blade should be broad. For the weak, it should be the opposite way, and it is best to draw blood in stages with a narrow wound, preferably a curved, slanted cut rather than stitches.
This type of phlebotomy is free from bleeding and nerve damage, which is better and safer than phlebotomy across and along. For those who experience fainting during phlebotomy, they should be given something to eat before the procedure, such as bread soaked in pomegranate water or jasmine water.
If, after lancing and draining the blood three or four times, the humor is bad, then take bread soaked in a mixture of myrrh or honey sweetened with spices, or in a pleasant drink infused with basil, before repeating the procedure.
If fainting occurs during lancing due to excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and a delicate basil-infused drink, and use spices, and open the chest with these, and employ all the remedies mentioned in the section on fainting.
For those who experience vomiting, and for those wishing to rest their arm and allow the blood to flow again, if the lancing was due to severe vomiting and the patient is weak, then the blood should be allowed to drain gradually in small amounts over several consecutive days.
If one wishes to rest their arm and allow the blood to flow again, and they are in good health, they should do so within seven to nine hours of the initial lancing. If one wants to draw the blood away from the direction it has flowed towards, they should repeat the procedure on the second or third day.
For those with a large amount of hot, intense blood that has caused fever, the blood should be drained in one go, removing as much as possible, and opening the wound wider until fainting occurs, after ensuring all conditions for lancing are met. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood is flowing to prevent death where fainting occurs, for this often happens if the bleeding person is unaware and a moment of inattention occurs; you should not do this if you want to release the arm and allow the blood to flow again.
If the sweat gland's orifice has closed and the blood is difficult to expel, do not squeeze or twist it harshly, as this is very harmful. Either leave it until it opens again on its own or use a scalpel to remove the congealed blood from the sweat gland's opening.
Or soak it in salt dissolved in water, or apply a distinct antidote like rhubarb or alum, and gently massage it to make the blood flow; if the sweat gland has swollen, leave it be.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides; if, however, it is necessary to expel the blood again, either continue to massage the affected area or move to another part of the arm or another sweat gland.
As for the bleeding from the arm, if either of the (antidotes) kohl or basilic is not available, it can be replaced due to its composition from both; the method of bleeding involves the patient immersing their hand in hot water until the wrist becomes red and the sweat glands are clearly visible, then a moderate amount of pressure is applied with a bandage.
Then, incise the vein slightly off-center, neither too wide nor too narrow. Make the opening wider above the wrist joint, and make your incision just above it. If the blood does not flow out easily, put the hand back into the hot water container and allow the blood to flow in the water.
If, during the summer days, it meets your need, you may omit reimmersing the hand in hot water; however, hot water is most beneficial for promoting blood flow, especially in winter. This vein is the safest to incise among all veins. Since it has no underlying nerves or veins, incising the superficial vein (aslim) of the right hand is beneficial for liver-related ailments. To perform this procedure, tie the wrist with a bandage or use your hand to hold it after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells.
Since it has no underlying nerves or veins, incising the superficial vein (aslim) of the right hand is beneficial for liver-related ailments. To perform this procedure, tie the wrist with a bandage or use your hand to hold it after immersing it in hot water until the vein swells. After careful examination, incise it slightly at a slight angle; if you completely sever it, it will not cause any harm. Be cautious; do not overdo it with the scalpel as there is a nerve beneath the fingers and the area is exposed without any flesh. Then, immerse the hand back into the hot water.
Allow the blood to flow in the vein; if you do not immerse it back into hot water, the blood will clot and stop flowing. When you have extracted as much blood as needed, apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent it from sealing quickly.
And likewise, one should act with every narrow branch. The benefit of the phlebotomy from the left hand is useful for splenetic diseases, and you should act with it as you did with the second, equally so. As for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit extends to diseases below the body, such as uterine ailments.
For amenorrhea, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thigh and leg, and similar ailments, the method of phlebotomy involves immersing the patient's foot in hot water while applying friction to promote vein congestion. Then, a ligature is applied above the ankle joint, securing the vein at the level of the calf near the heel, with the toe pointing towards the big toe.
It branches out in the face, with many tributaries. Phlebotomy should be performed on the widest branch or near the ankle where it joins, as this is best and safest. If you perform phlebotomy on the facial branches, be cautious of the nerves beneath the face.
Perform the phlebotomy by twisting the instrument as if you intended to amputate, ensuring the blade is clean. If the blood does not flow easily, immerse the foot in hot water and allow the blood to drain. If the phlebotomist mistakes the vein on their first attempt, they should repeat the procedure.
If the phlebotomy does not reach the intended vein, perform it slightly higher. The site will be safe with no complications if you avoid the nerve as mentioned. The same method applies to the saphenous vein of the other leg. For sciatic neuralgia, the location is as described, at the back of the knee on the outer side.
The benefit of amputation for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood: To perform the amputation, the patient should enter the bath, quickly and tightly grasp the leg from the hip up to above the ankle with four fingers using a thin, long bandage. This is how it should be done.
If it appears, amputate it in any case, either by setting it at an angle, which is better, or by completely cutting it off or making a slit, as long as the surrounding area remains intact. It is usually very subtle in most people and if you cannot find it.
If the sensation does not return at all, amputate some of its branches, which are visible on the back of the foot near the little finger and the ring finger, while being mindful of the nerves and preserving the blood flow as much as possible.
Then, remove the bandage, place a cotton ball on the amputation site, and secure it with a bandage. The wound will heal quickly.
Chapter Sixty-Nine
On Cupping and Its Application.
The cups can be made of various materials: horn, wood, copper, or glass. There are two types of cupping: one for drawing blood (with a suction effect) and the other for simply applying the cup without drawing blood.
And this cupping which is without condition takes place on two faces.
And the cupping of the jawbones, both sides of the neck, the cupping of the chin below the lower jaw from the mouth, the cupping of the shoulders, the cupping of the coccyx on the back side of the pelvis, the cupping of the arms in the middle, the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the ankle bones.
Cupping draws blood from the delicate veins spread throughout the flesh, for this reason, the force should not be as strong as lancing, and cupping should not be used, whether with or without fire, in cases of swelling, so that the whole body is emptied.
If cupping is required due to illness or habit, it should be used at any time of the month, first, last, or in the middle, and at any time of day.
For some people, when blood accumulates to the point where it needs to be drawn out by cupping, they experience a sensation of heaviness and headaches. Others may notice swelling, redness on their face, head, and neck, or itching on their face, sides, and dark circles under their eyes. Some even experience pain around the area of cupping.
And among them, some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit out blood; some sleep much, and others see blood, redness, slain bodies, and wounds in their dreams, and suchlike. But when did we ever see any of these things?
And particularly if it is in the middle third of the month, we command cupping after two or three hours have passed in the day; and the benefit of cupping a small wound is that it helps with the heaviness in the head and the flow of fluid to the eyes.
But it should be after emptying the body entirely; this cupping can replace the phlebotomy. It is dangerous for those with a cold-natured constitution or those suffering from a fever, as it can cause great harm to them.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold-related illnesses should avoid it, as long-term use can lead to memory loss.
Therefore, the cupper should lower their hand with the cup slightly to prevent memory loss; and the cupping on the back replaces phlebotomy on the eye socket and the basilic vein.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, headaches, coughing, and congestion; cupping on the back should be slightly raised because if it is done too low, it can cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
And as for the cupping of the temples, it is beneficial for pains occurring in the head, eye strain, migraines, throat pain, and aching at the roots of the teeth, serving as a substitute for phlebotomy. One should instruct the cupper not to insert his hand too deeply, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
And as for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, gum decay, and similar diseases of the mouth, serving as a substitute for phlebotomy in the gums and lips. Cupping on the shoulders is effective against palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
And as for cupping on the inner thigh, it is beneficial for what phlebotomy does to the three veins: the basilic, lateral, and temporal, as it draws blood from all those delicate veins in the flesh, attracting them from other, thinner veins into thicker ones.
One should instruct the cupper not to insert too deeply, as the area is devoid of flesh and contains nerves and arteries beneath. A single cupping on the coccyx is beneficial for hemorrhoids and lower abdominal ulcers.
One should instruct the cupper for the cups to be large and made of copper, as the area requires strong suction, and a glass cup may break easily and cause excessive wounding. The cups for the legs are insufficient in drawing blood effectively.
Because it draws blood from all parts of the body and is beneficial for chronic pain in the kidneys, wombs, and bladders, it induces menstruation and is effective against boils and abscesses, serving as a substitute for phlego- and lymphatic drainage, except that it exhausts the body greatly and causes fainting in many people. The lymph nodes of the legs derive similar benefits to those of the leg venae.
The technique of applying cupping: Firstly, place the cupping glass empty and apply a moderate suction. Do not prolong the placement of the cups, but rather apply them swiftly and remove them quickly to allow the humors to flow into the affected area evenly. Continue this process, repeating it multiple times until the area becomes red and open.
When the affected area appears red, apply more suction slowly and then observe the condition of the body. If a person has soft flesh with porous pores, it is enough to apply one cup only, otherwise, the area may ulcerate.
The cupper should expand the area of suction, deepen it slightly, and adjust the suction with gentleness and delicate movement. If there is thick blood, it is necessary to apply the cup twice: once to open the path for the smooth flow of blood and moisture, and a second time to completely remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the cupping process a third time to achieve the desired result. In general, if one wishes to remove a small amount of blood, a single cupping session is sufficient. However, for removing large amounts of blood, apply more cups, especially if the blood is thick.
It is necessary to apply a deep incision and a moderate amount of pressure, reaching only the depth of the skin, when using cauterization. Oils, water, and other substances should be avoided during the procedure, as recommended by the specialist. For those with thick, tough, dry skin, with narrow pores, special care is required.
The incision sites should be treated with opening, softening, and dissolving oils, such as myrrh, rose oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil, especially during the summer months.
If it is during the winter, then use oils such as narcissus, iris, chamomile, or lily, and for a thick, cold residue, consider oils like ginger, fennel, licorice, or mint.
If the patient has large pores and soft, fresh skin, it is best to avoid oil and these individuals should wash their incisions after cauterization with rosewater or cold water or grapevine water or cucumber water or mullein water, especially if they have excessive moisture in their blood.
They should wash their incisions with vinegar or water mixed with sumac, and for those with thick residues, use an old drink or water of ginger, fennel, mint, or chamomile. Be cautious about performing cauterization in baths or immediately after a bath.
It is necessary to use (the treatment) after exiting the bath, either one or two hours later, and no one should sleep after cupping, what the person who undergoes cupping and sweating should arrange before and after cupping.
If the person who undergoes cupping (has) a jaundiced condition with predominant sharpness and inflammation in their blood, they should take cooling agents such as pomegranate, dandelion, vinegar, lettuce, henbane, and similar plants, and make their diet consist of fried foods, lamb meat, sour fruits, and similar items.
For those with a cold temperament, they should drink honey water, mib or bitter henbane seed beverages, and moderate aromatic wine (between old and new), and be instructed to eat little, consuming mainly fried foods, artichokes, quail, and pigeon chicks as safecooked dishes, and the beverage on the day of cupping and sweating should be more abundant than the food.
In some cases, certain people should be given a dose of a distinguishing antidote or musk medicine or chila (a traditional remedy) before cupping or sweating, or after, to strengthen the major organs and thin the blood; however, it is not recommended for those who are heated or agitated.
The cuppings that are unconditional are those applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate conditions, but rather, they aim either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Placing the cup on the breasts in case of nosebleed, or using it to apply cold air to a member that has become congested, as we do with the cup placed on the abdomen and navel, which loosens the member, warms it, and alleviates pain to release that congestion.
It can also be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stones, where its suction force may open the obstruction or dislodge the stones, and similarly for the liver and spleen when gases become disturbed in them. These cups can also be used simply by sucking.
It can also be used over fire or filled with warm water for issues related to constipation. The cup should be filled, either solely with hot water or with water that has been boiled with certain herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then it is placed over the area, held, removed, and repeated as needed. This is a depiction of the cup used over fire:
Its capacity is two fingers open, as illustrated, and its depth is half a palm. On the side, there is a small hole, about the size of an needle, made from brass or yellow copper with a thick edge.
Smooth, even, and polished to prevent injury to the member when placed upon it. In the center is a crossbar of copper or iron where the candle over fire is placed. These cups can be made larger than described or smaller depending on the illness.
The use of a cold iron depends on the age and physical build of the patient, as it is not the same for boys, slender individuals, or men with well-developed bodies. To apply this instrument, one holds a piece of cotton soaked in fire or a small candle made from tar to the middle of the rigid penis, which lies at the center of the cold iron.
The flame should be directed upwards towards the base of the cold iron to prevent burning the patient's body, then it is placed on the organ, and a finger is placed over the mentioned hole, so that when we grip the cold iron, the finger does not need to be removed.
The steam emerges from the hole, causing the cold iron to loosen on the member. Then, the flame is applied to the surface and, if necessary, the process is repeated. For the cold iron used in treating a water-filled bladder, there is no rigid penis or hole.
It is only used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ, and this is its appearance:
The larger the cold iron, capable of accommodating a lot of water, the better it is.
Chapter 79
On the treatment of hemorrhoids.
The needle is primarily used in most cases for organs where stitches cannot be placed, either because they are too small, such as the lip, gum, and the like, or because the organ is exposed without flesh, such as the finger, nose, and the like.
The method of using them is to take the needles that are in fresh, clean water free from impurities, and then leave them in the water for a day and night until they become hungry and empty within. Then the body should first purge itself through phlebotomy or cupping, and then the affected member should be cleansed.
Until it turns red, then the needle should be placed upon it. If it fills up, it will fall off, and if possible, suction at the site with a cupping glass is most beneficial. Otherwise, wash the site with vinegar followed by plenty of water, massage and squeeze; if the bleeding persists after the needle falls off, apply a cold water-soaked cotton cloth.
Place it on top until the discharge stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered glass, or sumac, or similar astringents until it stops, or apply half of a freshly peeled and sliced calamus root to the site.
Leave it until the calamus sticks to the site; then the bleeding will stop. If, however, it is necessary to use a new needle, do not use the same one if possible. If the needle refuses to adhere, clean the site with fresh blood.
If you insert a needle into the wound to express blood, and then remove it, when it comes into contact with the wound, it adheres. If you wish to remove it, sprinkle some frankincense or salt or ash onto it, and it will come away from the wound.
Chapter III
In algebra.
This chapter also deals with the art of healing, specifically fracture reduction and bone setting.
Know, O sons, that this chapter is claimed by physicians and the common folk, and there are those who have never even heard of or read a word from the ancient texts on this subject.
For this reason, the knowledge of this art has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered an expert in it. I have only gained knowledge from it through lengthy study of the works of the ancients, and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted their science from them; then, I devoted myself to experience and training throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses on the subject. Having subjected it to my experience, I have brought it near to you, freeing it from the complexities of elongation, summarizing it to its utmost, explaining it in the clearest manner, and depicting for you numerous images of the instruments used in it.
It is indeed a further explanation, as I have done in the preceding chapters, and there is no power but that of the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
In this chapter, after presenting the general principles of bone fractures and dislocations, before detailing the specific broken and dislocated members, one should first outline essential concepts through sentences and sections. You must first understand and grasp the truth of it, for yourself and those eager to learn this noble art.
So I say, whenever one experiences a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, you must first rush to reduce or stabilize it, or both. If there is no obstacle, such as weakness of strength, or if the affected person is a young child or an elderly person, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be restricted to cold legumes, bird meat, and venison. He should avoid drinks, fatty meats, overindulgence in food, and any meal that fills the vessels with blood. Until the swelling is resolved and there is no risk of fluid accumulation at the site.
Then, the patient should return to his initial diet, which consists of foods that are rich, dense, and durable, such as porridge, rice, heads of cattle, and beef stomachs. Eggs, fresh fish, thick drinks, and similar foods are part of this regimen, which ensures that the fracture heals faster and better. Note that broken bones in strong adults or elderly people may never heal completely to their original state.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, what was once flexible may heal together like the bones of young children, but nature produces a substance on the broken bone from all sides, similar to glue, which thickens and sticks, causing the pieces to adhere tightly to each other.
They stick together so firmly that the joint becomes as strong and secure as it was before, without hindering any of its functions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should include foods that are firm, viscous, and thick as we have mentioned. Know that fractures may vary in type depending on the differing parts of the body, for a fracture of the femur bone is different from a fracture of the skull bone, and a fracture of the rib cage bone differs from a fracture of the spinal bone.
Similarly, all other parts of the body differ from one another, and we will mention each type of fracture, explaining it in detail in its own section, without distinguishing between them. The type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
Because it may be a fracture without chips, and it may be a fracture along the bone with chips and protrusions that are either healing or unhealed, and the fracture may be accompanied by wounds and breaches in the skin, and it may be a slight crack.
Each type has a specific method of treatment, which will be detailed in its own place, and one can recognize a bone fracture by its deformity, displacement, sensitivity, and the popping or crunching sound it makes when touched with the hand.
If there is no apparent deformity, popping, or sensitivity when examining the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, it is not a fracture but could be a sprain, a minor break, or a slight crack. Therefore, one must not attempt to move the bone by stretching or touching it.
Carry out the application of the medicines mentioned later, which are appropriate for the condition, and then tighten it gently. Know that when a bone breaks and cracks into two parts without causing shards, it is still possible for each part to detach from the other.
You should take the initiative to correct and align it as soon as you notice any deviation, before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does appear, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then straighten it as best as you can with gentleness and ingenuity.
Know that repairing and aligning it is easier than a bone with fragments, then proceed with what will be mentioned later. If the bone has fragments, it is necessary to extend the broken member from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg.
Either use your hands if the member is small, or two strings, or a string with a hand, and place the member in a flat position on its natural shape. As soon as part of the broken bone extends, then cut off these excess parts and return them to their proper positions using all possible means of gentleness and ingenuity.
Take care to avoid causing any pain or discomfort to the patient with your actions. Strive to bring one bone back to its companion in the best way possible. At this time, you should touch and feel them with your hand, and if you find anything incorrect, correct and align it within your abilities.
Beware of excessive swelling and strong inflammation, as many ignorant people do, often causing a hot lump or a tumor in the affected area, as you have seen them do repeatedly.
Then, after adjusting and perfecting it, you should command the affected area to rest and caution the patient against moving it during wakefulness, sleep, turning over, defecation, or any other movement within their capability, ensuring that the position of the member is such that it relieves pain.
If, while in a certain position, the member feels pain or discomfort, it should be moved to a different position where there is no pain, and care should be taken to ensure that this new position is level and straight.
To prevent any deformity in the member if it is forced, and regarding the method of binding a broken member, as I have described to you; know that broken members vary in size and shape, whether small like the arm, finger, ulna, or others, or large like the leg or hip.
Therefore, the bandages should be soft and flexible for small members like the arm or finger, but broader and stiffer for larger ones such as the thigh, back, or chest, to ensure that the wide bandage supports the large member equally from all sides without any gap.
Then, after you have finished preparing, you should begin to apply the appropriate paint. In a gentle compression on the fracture site, you begin by wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself, three or four wraps as required by the member, slightly tightening your hand with the bandage, then moving it upwards from the fracture site.
With less tension than you applied to the fractured site, you then slightly separate the wrap from the fracture and relax the tension a little bit until you achieve the correct amount of pressure. Then, take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wraps, then move the bandage to the lower side of the fracture. In the same manner as described for the first wrap above, adjust the tension and relaxation. Place a layer of soft padding or cloth between the wraps to equalize the curvature of the fracture.
If there is a curvature, do not add anything; otherwise, wrap another bandage over the existing ones and secure with firm splints if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the member.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something to soothe the swelling and relieve the pain, leaving it for several days. Then, securely wrap with splints made from half-inch wide strips of carefully carved wood or splints fashioned from wooden sieve frames.
Gipuses made from cedar, palm fronds, juniper, or gravel, and other similar materials readily available, should be of the same size and shape as depicted here.
However, if the splint to be placed on the broken bone itself is thicker and wider than the others, its length should be made according to the size of the broken member, as depicted in the image.
Then, secure the splints with another bandage, following the same tension as the initial one. Bind it above with strong threads, emphasizing the pressure on the broken area. The tension should be less the further it is from the break.
The threads should be of medium thickness and softness, preferably made from wet flax. Using thick threads, as often done by the ignorant who make their threads from strips of untwisted flax, is a grave error.
Because tension with these thin threads falls outside the optimal range, and they do not allow for precise control of the pressure. There should be no space between the splints larger than a finger.
If the patient is troubled by the edges of the splints after proper tensioning, place soft padding underneath, such as cloth or wool, to prevent further discomfort. If there is a fracture with an associated wound and skin laceration, this will be discussed separately.
Know that not every broken member should be bound with splints from the first day. For if the member is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of hot swelling.
This describes the bandages that were used by the ancients for fractures, wounds, and dislocations, a general dressing that sets the bone and is suitable for all conditions, especially for children and women, as it does not have heat or cold.
It is to take flour dust, the inner part of the grain that clings to the walls of the mill when it turns, and knead it as it is, without sifting it with egg white, making sure it is neither too thick nor too thin, then shaping it.
Another type of dressing for fractures, dislocations, and wounds: take hair from goats, sheep, and lambs, and add 10 drams each of mastic, resin, and frankincense, 5 drams of myrrh and galangal, and 20 drams of Armenian or Roman clay. Mix well. All should be ground and mixed with myrtle water or egg white if the patient's condition is hot. This dressing, when used, is harmonious, quickly setting broken bones and suitable for most people due to its moderate nature.
A different type of dressing is also beneficial for fractures and wounds, consisting of 10 drams each of marshmallow, licorice, and white henna, 5 drams each of sumac and myrrh, 6 drams of Armenian clay, and 20 drams of wheat. All ingredients are finely ground, sieved, mixed with water or egg whites, and applied.
A dressing for joints and bones that have moved out of place, alleviating the accompanying pain and headaches, is prepared by soaking wool in vinegar and cooked oil, then applying it to the affected area. This dressing does not possess any strong healing properties.
However, it is particularly effective in alleviating swelling and pain, especially heat-related swelling. A different dressing is prepared for a broken bone, consisting of ground mulberry leaves and wild poppy seeds mixed with moistened material. This concise dressing is used when there is a fracture of the bone.
If you wish to further reduce the swelling, prepare a mixture of equal parts of henna, chamomile, rose petals, and fennel flour, or, if the member is fresh, use parsley water instead. Apply this dressing.
A stronger dressing for reducing swelling, to be used when a solid bruise occurs with a broken bone, is prepared from equal parts of henna, flaxseed, cumin, rosemary, marjoram, rose petals, and chamomile.
All apply and mix with water or fresh water or paint, depending on the heat of the member and the quietness of its temperature; while Hippocrates did not mention in his book to place anything on the broken member when setting it.
Except for the caulk made from wax and oil, it is described as being neither too thick nor too thin, and Galen suggested placing substances with a drying effect and some heat on the broken member during its setting, such as salt, pepper, resin, and similar materials as we have mentioned.
The dressing is beneficial for weakness and pain, take a mixture of lint, sesame seeds, human hair, or bird feathers, and salt, grind them finely, mix well, and apply as a bandage. The amount of the bandage should be adjusted according to the injury.
Then, observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone occurs, do not remove the bandage for many days. If symptoms such as intense itching, discomfort, or swelling appear at the site, then remove it.
Act swiftly and remove the bandage, do not delay. Then, take a soft cloth or sponge and soak it in lukewarm water, gently apply it to the affected area to relieve itching and pain, allowing the member to rest for an hour.
Then, place on it the softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose fat, and secure it with a light bandage for a night until the hot swelling is alleviated, the puffiness of the member subsides, and its pain disappears. Then return it to the gentle tension and a light dressing, not applying as much pressure as before.
Treat it gently until it heals, if you find that the swelling, redness, pain, puffiness, and all symptoms have completely disappeared and you need to apply a bandage and tension, then do so as before. If nothing of what we mentioned occurs in the member.
Do not remove the bandage unless it has been three, four, five, or seven days, and sometimes even after 20 days, depending on the condition of the member as we have said. If the fracture is healing and the tissue is nearly closed around it.
At this point, also increase the tension more than your initial bandage and also thicken the diet of the patient as mentioned before. If you find that the fracture site has dried out and become thinner than it should be, know that the food is not reaching it.
Then, every time you remove the bandage, wash it with warm water. Do this every three days and slightly reduce the tension. This action promotes blood flow to the member and speeds up healing. Avoid what the ignorant do, who break the member again due to excessive tension.
If a wound does not heal as it should and heals despite being crooked, it is a mistake due to their actions and a great risk. If it were correct, the pioneers would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it. I have seen no trace of such a thing in their work. And indeed, the correct course of action is not to follow it.
Chapter Two.
On the Occurring Fracture in the Head.
There are many types of fractures occurring in the head, with various shapes and diverse causes. Some fractures result from a sword strike, where the bone is completely broken all the way to the duramater beneath the bone. As the blow does with wood.
This type of fracture is therefore called 'cadomi' (coming-in). The sword may cut some of the bone, leaving its face intact without penetrating to the end, and this type of fracture is called a complete avulsion. These fractures can be either large or small.
There are also fractures that are shattering or crushing, caused by a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone or the like. This type of fracture can either penetrate closely to the duramater beneath the bone or affect the face of the bone.
And the wound of these fractures may be either large or small, and some fractures are subtle, hidden in the bone, like a slight split.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "shapely" (or "hairline"), and some fractures result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object that enters the bone surface inward, creating a depression similar to what happens when copper is struck by a hammer, with part of it entering inward.
This is most common in the soft bones of a child's head, and all types of fractures may have loose or stuck fragments. We will discuss the treatment of each type in its proper place, and we will identify these fracture types through examination.
They are examined with probes, and corrupt flesh is removed from them. For a hairline fracture, the bone is inspected and marked with ink; if the fracture appears black, it indicates a break. In treating fractures, one must first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe symptoms indicating fear, such as vomiting bile, restlessness, disorientation, loss of voice, fainting, fever, red and bulging eyes, or other similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them. For these symptoms strongly suggest that death is imminent.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you wish for his safety, then take charge of his treatment. This is because if the wounded person comes to you in the initial stages of wounding, especially during the winter days,
You should make every effort to remove the bone before the 14th day, regardless of the season. However, in summer days, you should expedite the removal of the bone before the 7th day, before the membrane beneath it spoils, thus exhibiting the symptoms we described.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and is accompanied by crushing and bruising, you should then cut off the damaged part as I have described, which involves shaving the head of the patient with a wound.
And when examining the bone, uncover it in whatever way you can and according to the shape of the wound, and if you notice any bleeding or hot swelling during the examination, treat it as necessary.
This involves packing the wound with cloth soaked in a mixture of rosewater and fat, cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops, then proceeding to trim and extract the bone, which can be done through one of two methods.
The first method is to cut the bone using a delicate, narrow blade, and this is its image:
Then use another segment after this segment, slightly wider, and this is its figure:
Then you also use another segment wider than the second one, and it is necessary that you have several segments of different widths, some wider and some shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp at their ends, whether from Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in striking the segment to avoid shaking the head and causing it harm, for if the bone is strong and hard, you should drill around it before using the segments with drills called non-immersion chisels, which they call non-penetrating chisels.
Because they do not exceed the limit of the skull bone beyond it, for the drill has a rounded tip below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, which prevents it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And you should take several of these chisels, each suitable for the thickness of a particular bone, so that you have for every skull a drill with a sharp tip in length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull, and this is an image of three types. From the drills: large, medium, and small:
And as for the method of drilling around a broken bone, it is to place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another location and make sure that the distance between each hole is equal to or similar to the thickness of the rod.
Then, cut with scissors between each two holes, acting with all the care possible as we have said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with some other tool prepared for this purpose.
Like the forceps and tweezers, you must be extremely careful not to touch the drill or scissors with the peritoneum. Once you have strengthened the bone and it is free from the peritoneum, if it has been attached, you should clean it.
The roughness remaining on the bone should be smoothed with another tool similar to scissors, but finer and more delicate. If any small fragments or chips of bone remain, they should be carefully removed with the tools at your disposal.
Then, the wound should be treated with bandages and ointments as mentioned. The other aspect of this work is straightforward and free from danger, as described by Galen and highly praised, as follows: You should first expose the portion of the bone at the site where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed this part, place the tip of this lens-shaped scissor under it.
The posterior part of the lens is smooth and does not cut, while the sharp part on its sides extends along the length as you see, so that the posterior part rests on the peritoneum, and the face of the sharp cut is on the bone, then strike the cut from one side.
Use a small hammer to cut through the bone gently as it spins, and be secure in the knowledge that the membrane will not suffer any frightening mishap, even if the healer is the most ignorant and cowardly among people, yes, even while asleep.
If anything remains necessary for the bone from the membrane in certain places of the bone, scrape it off with the same lens cutter's tip and remove it gently, for it will depart without harm or fear.
If the bone fracture did not penetrate the membrane and what broke off from the bone is still rough with fragments remaining, it is necessary to smooth that roughness and remove those fine fragments using delicate forceps. You should have a set of different sized instruments to choose from for each situation, according to your work.
You should examine the broken bone and its shape, and first use the widest forceps in your set to remove any coarse fragments. Then, after that, use a more precise pair, continuing in this manner with increasing precision until you reach the thinnest and most delicate forceps.
And as for the other small cracks and delicate fractures, one should use a treatment for each according to what leads to its healing, which is something not hidden from those who have even the slightest experience in this craft and have studied our writings and explanations regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when removing the bone, one should take a piece of cotton cloth fitting the size of the wound and dip it in rose fat, then place it over the wound. Then take another cloth, folded or cut into a triangle shape. Dip it in a drink and rose fat, then place it on the first cloth, making this as gentle as possible to avoid weighing down the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage and tighten it only enough to hold the wound in place.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until the hot swelling subsides, then remove the bandage and use medications that have a drying effect, such as roots of colchicum, flour of crocus, powdered galangal, and ziraund, among others, by making dust from these drugs.
Sprinkle the wound with these dry powders, and in general, use a remedy that clarifies without burning. Strive during treatment to keep the wound clean, free from fat or dirt, and never allow pus to accumulate.
Because when pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing great harm to the patient; and it may occur in the cranial sac when the bone becomes exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If you observe a blackening on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we mentioned, know that death is inevitable. If the blackening occurred due to a treatment, that treatment was potent enough to cause this blackening.
One should take a portion of honey and three portions of rose fat, mix them well, apply the mixture to a cloth, place it on the cranial sac, and then treat the patient with all the necessary remedies until they recover.
Chapter III
In the treatment of a broken nose.
Know that the nose is broken when both upper fissures (or one of them) are affected, as they are bone; but the lower part, being cartilage, does not break, rather it may be bent, deformed, or compressed.
If one fissure is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nasal cavity and straighten the break from inside with your index and thumb fingers from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. This should be done gently, taking care not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is at the tip of the nose and no finger has entered it, it should be adjusted with a rod slightly thicker on one side, and if the fracture is on both sides, do the same. It is necessary to hurry to fix it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, and otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then insert a thread of cotton cloth into the nasal hole for a single fracture, or two threads for both sides.
The threads should be thick enough to fill the nasal hole, and some of the first surgeons recommended greasing them with lard and changing them every day, but I do not agree with this. Instead, I suggest soaking the threads in a mixture of egg white and powder from the mill.
Then, leave the threads until the bone heals and the cartilage hardens. You can insert tubes made of duck feathers into the nose where the threads are placed, wrapped in soft cloth, which will help keep the fracture in place and prevent the patient from having difficulty breathing.
This is not strictly necessary, but if you wish to create the threads, you can do so. If a hot swelling appears during your work, apply a poultice or a cotton ball soaked in vinegar and oil of rose or any diachylon paste to the nose.
If a hot tumor does not appear, it should be bandaged from the outside with fine flour and ground asafoetida mixed with egg white, then a soft compress is placed on top. Do not tie the nose to anything at all; if the nasal bones break, they should be set in small pieces.
If the tumor is fractured, it should be punctured and the fragments removed with the appropriate instrument, then the wound is stitched and treated with suitable ointments for healing. If there is an injury inside the nose, it should be treated with fusing and lead pipes. so that it heals.
Chapter IV.
In the case of broken lower jawbones.
If the lower jawbone breaks without a wound, and it is not broken in two places, but rather bends inward, its position can be easily corrected.
If the break is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and similarly, if the break is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the broken piece from inside to outside.
With your other hand, control the bone's alignment from outside, if a fracture of the jaw has split into two parts, it should be used with pressure from both sides to achieve straightness for its adjustment. If it occurs in the teeth, they will sprout again.
Or, if they separate, tighten what you hope to keep with a gold or silver thread or linen, then place on the broken beard a layer of asphaltum, followed by a folded cloth and, over that, a large, tight splint or a piece of leather from a shoe, equal in length to the beard. Then, secure it from above in a manner that suits you, ensuring it aligns with the healing process, until it does not unravel. Command the patient to rest and keep them calm, providing soft porridge as food. If you notice any change in the shape, even the slightest, in any way, be quick to undo the binding on the third day.
Then, secure it from above in a manner that suits you, ensuring it aligns with the healing process, until it does not unravel. Command the patient to rest and keep them calm, providing soft porridge as food. If you notice any change in the shape, even the slightest, in any way, be quick to undo the binding on the third day. Then, prepare a new dressing with powdered stone (presumably lime) and egg white or semolina flour, after removing the asphaltum. Place a soft, flexible bandage over it. As long as this new bandage adheres well and does not change the bone's position, leave it in place.
Do not remove it until the bone has healed and the fracture has strengthened, for this fracture often takes three weeks to fully heal. If a hot swelling appears during this time, apply the remedies we have mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the swelling subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, you should inspect it to see if any fragment(s) of bone remain. If so, carefully remove these fragments using the appropriate instrument, and if the opening of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
After removing the fragments, if none remain, then outline the wound edge if it is wide, and otherwise, apply one of the suitable ointments to it. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter V.
On reducing the shoulder blade (if fractured).
The clavicle (shoulder blade) most commonly fractures near its end at the shoulder joint, and it can break in one of three ways: either splitting into two pieces without any fragments, which is the easiest to set; or with one or more fragments forming, which complicates the reduction process.
Either the fracture may occur with fragments, which is more difficult to reduce, or it might be accompanied by a wound. If there's no wound, have two assistants help you: one holds the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, while the other extends the patient's neck towards the opposite side.
Then, equalize the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any bumps or gouges. If more extension is needed, place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
And the bone should be manipulated as needed, extending and lifting the clavicle while pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is aligned properly. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outward due to its depth, the patient should lie on their back.
And a pad should be placed under the patient's elbow, which a server will press downward to lift the clavicle that is deeply embedded upwards. At this point, you may correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is mobile, you should probe it and gently extract the fragment. If the fragment is trapped within the bone, use one of the cutting tools prepared for this purpose to dislodge it. After the fracture is reduced, place under the clavicle a splint that secures the skin (psa) – an instrument made of wood or iron, as depicted below:
It resembles a spoon without jagged edges, with its width adjusted according to the size of the bone and its length suitable for your work, one end wider than the other as you can see.
If the wound laceration that you have made in removing a fragment of bone is wide and you have secured the hot tumor, then close the wound with stitches. If the laceration is slight or you fear the hot tumor, then enlarge the wound with additional incisions and staples according to the extent of the cut.
If there is a hot tumor, moisten the incision with rose oil, vinegar, or drink, and apply it. For the fixation of a bone without any wound or cut, use a plaster made from powder from a millstone mixed with egg white. Place a soft bandage on it, then place a ball under his armpit if necessary, then take a long cloth, about an inch wide, and wrap it around the bandage and padding, and finally, take a splint made from a thin board. Make it three fingers wide and long, then insert it into a cloth, wrap the cloth with the splint in place, and secure the bandage tightly around the fracture as you would a circle. Apply it to his neck, the correct armpit, and the affected armpit, pulling it back and forth on both sides. As you can see, the tension secures the fracture firmly, which is evident.
And understand that the splint should not be removed from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day. As soon as the bandage relaxes and the splint is removed, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on their back and place a small cushion under their armpit when they sleep at night.
So that the arm may be raised from the side, thus raising the fracture of the clavicle with the movement of the shoulder or by binding the arm to the neck, and do not loosen the bandage unless there is a change in the condition after twelve days due to itching or swelling.
Then renew the bandage if you see that it is necessary. It should be pulled and left until the fracture of the clavicle heals and hardens, becoming stronger and more robust within twenty-eight days. It may be the case for some people in less than that time.
Chapter VI.
In the healing of the shoulder fracture, it is rare that the shoulder joint itself fractures, but rather the bones' ends or somewhere in the middle. One can determine this by touch. The shape of the fracture determines the treatment.
Restoring it to its natural shape using any method possible, then apply a mixture of mortar, egg white, and soft lint to the area. Place a pad of folded cloth on top, followed by a broad splint made from a board.
It should be cut as thin as possible, or slightly wider, covering the entire shoulder or its joints. If there is a depression under the splint, fill it with soft lint until the splint lies flat, then secure it with a long bandage.
Tightly secure and ensure the splint remains in place, checking the wrap daily. If it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint. The patient should lie on their healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in approximately 20 days.
After 20 or 25 days, remove the wrap securely, as it is safe to do so. If any bone fragments protrude and cause discomfort under the skin, make a cut and extract them. Follow the same procedure for treating a fracture of the clavicle, including addressing any hot swelling.
Chapter VII
In the Treatment of Chest Fractures.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, but this is rare, while its extremities are more prone to fracture and dislocation. Among its symptoms, if the fracture occurs in the middle, it tends to tilt downwards, causing severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
And it may ooze blood, revealing a depression in the broken bone, which is not hidden from the senses. To set it, the patient should lie on his back, placing a pillow between his shoulders, then pressing his elbows and gathering the ribs with hands on both sides, gently smoothing it out as much as possible.
And it should be wrapped with bandages and a splint, placing a light wooden board or similar material on top, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then, gently tie it to the broken bone to prevent shifting, wrapping the bandage around the back in a circular motion and tightening it firmly. Check the bandage periodically, tightening it as needed, especially after any relaxation.
If, during the healing process, any discomfort, pain, or swelling occurs at the site, dissolve the bandage, treat the problem, and then reapply it if necessary. Face and bind it tightly until it heals.
Chapter VIII
In the case of a broken rib, know that the fracture occurs in the stiff portions adjacent to the back or at the ends from the front, due to pressure. This is because they are cartilaginous, and this fact is easily discernible through tactile inspection.
Correct the fracture by aligning the broken bone with the fingers on the firmest part, until the shape is even as it should be. Then bandage and secure the broken bone with a splint, if necessary. If the ribs are fractured inward, it will cause severe pain for the patient.
And puncture, like the puncture that affects those with a chest illness, as the bone punctures the pleura, and it also causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and spitting up large amounts of blood, which is difficult to treat, and the ancients used many tricks for it.
Some said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce gas and wind, to cause the stomach to swell and expand, pushing the fracture outward. We disapprove of this, as it may confirm the presence of a hot tumor, if one is not already present. If a tumor has occurred, this treatment would only increase and confirm it.
Some say that a cup should be applied to the site and then sucked out with force, similar to measurement, except that there is a fear that the cup may attract curiosity to the weak site. Some say that the site should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The dressing should be placed between the ribs until it fills, making the bandage even when wrapped around in a circle, then treat the patient with treatment for bruises using food and medicine. If the patient is severely exhausted, it is something they cannot endure. The bone was penetrating the peritoneum painfully, and we were concerned for the patient. Therefore, we should make an incision at the site, expose the broken rib, and place under it the device that preserves the peritoneum described earlier, then cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then, if the wound is large, sew its edges together and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot lump appears during this time, act quickly by soaking the dressing in rose oil and applying it to the site, also treating the patient internally to soothe the lump.
He should lie on the side that is most comfortable for sleep until he heals.
Chapter IX
In Treating Herniated Discs in the Back and Neck.
However, if the bones of the neck are fractured and such an injury is rare, it is often due to impact or pressure. Similarly, for the vertebrae in the back, if a person experiences such an injury and you wish to determine whether they will recover fully or not. Examine, if you see that his hands have become limp, numb, and paralyzed, and he is unable to move them or grip them, and even pricking or poking them with a needle causes no sensation or pain, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases, for it is often fatal.
If he can move them and feels the pricking or poking, then know that the spinal cord is unharmed and the patient will recover with treatment. If a herniated disc in the back presents similarly, you may determine whether recovery is probable by applying these same principles.
Examine his legs; if they have become weak and show similar symptoms to the hands, then when he lies down on his back, gas and feces escape involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine escapes without control. If he lies on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that he is most likely dead. Do not bother with treatment, for if none of the above symptoms occur, the condition is less severe. The treatment for the swelling and heat is to apply a cold compress.
By applying rose fat alone or with fried egg whites to the diseased fissure three times a day, until the hot tumor subsides, then apply one of the strengthening, drying bandages and secure it with a bandage, ordering rest and immobility.
He should not sleep on the affected side until the pain disappears, and if a fracture or something that has healed away is present in the bone, it should be cut through with a scalpel and the bone extracted. Then, if the wound is large, sew the edges together and treat it with sealing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx (the tailbone) breaks, insert the thumb from the left hand into the anus.
Adjust the broken bone with the other hand as best you can, then apply a bandage and a splint if necessary, and secure it tightly.
If you feel a broken shard inside, cut through it with a scalpel and extract it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Ten
In setting a broken hip.
If the bones of the hip do not break, or if they do, it is as if they crumble at their ends, split lengthwise, and tilt inward, causing pain in the affected area for the patient, numbness, and paralysis of the leg from which the break occurred.
If you need to reduce the fracture, use your hand to manipulate it until you stand on the break and assess its shape. If the fracture is only at the ends, straighten it as best suits you, ensuring it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to reduce it, then dress the wound and apply a splint made of wood or leather, securing it tightly.
Do not worry about the fracture shifting or the splint coming loose; adjust the depression in the hips to fill any gaps, ensuring even pressure. Order the patient to sleep on their back or on the healthy side, and if a hot swelling appears, treat it accordingly.
Cease to extend or reduce the fracture until the hot swelling subsides, applying remedies as mentioned. Then, return to setting and securing the splint as appropriate. If any fragments or chips appear at the ends of the bone, they should not be removed.
It should not be touched from within, but only smoothed from without, and its tension should be left until it heals.
Chapter XI.
In the treatment of a broken arm.
The arm, from the elbow to the shoulder joint, if broken, should be treated by using a curved and smooth stick of moderate thickness, as shown in this figure.
Tie two bands at the ends, then hang it from a high place and have the patient sit on a chair. Then, place the broken arm on the stick so that its armpit is aligned with the middle of the curve, and hang a heavy object from above.
Or, a servant can extend it downwards, and the physician should straighten the break with both hands until it is in the correct position, as shown in the other method: have the patient lie on their back and hang their hand from their neck with a band.
Then, command two servants: one to hold the upper part of the break with their hands, and the other to hold the lower part. If you wish for a stronger pull, tighten the band under the break and above it, and have each servant pull in their respective directions.
If the fracture is near the side of the shoulder joint, the middle of the ligature should be under the armpit and the other end under the fracture towards the elbow; likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, the ligature should be placed at that point and on the elbow itself.
Then, the fracture should be gently adjusted without force until it is in the correct position and well aligned. If there is no sign of a hot swelling, tighten it as necessary. If a hot swelling appears, do not tighten it until the seventh day, applying a compress soaked with vinegar and rose fat to it.
Once the swelling subsides, then tighten it. The procedure for tightening it is to place a bandage over the fracture, then wrap a new cloth around it, and finally gather the arm at the elbow and place the hand open on the shoulder.
Carry the cloth and tighten it on the arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint if there is no impediment and no change in the fractured bone. If you fear that something may change, use splints instead.
It involves placing a splint directly on the fracture, wider and stronger than other splints, with a space of one finger width between each splint, and ensuring their length covers the fracture with an additional three fingers from both sides.
Then, apply the compression as mentioned in the introduction of this book.
And it should be that the compression on the fracture site is stronger.
And the less distance between the fracture, the greater the compression should be; if you observe the application of bandages and compression as we mentioned in your time of setting the member, then do so.
And if you fear the development of a hot swelling, then leave off compression and bandages until the seventh day, as we mentioned; then inspect the binding every three days to ensure no itching, bulging, or blockage of nourishment to the member due to excessive tension, so that all these things may be remedied as we have stated.
If you are certain that none of these things will occur, then do not loosen the binding for a long time; let the patient lie on his back, with his hand on his stomach, and place under the arm a padded cushion filled with wool, moderate in thickness.
Inspect at all times, day or night, to ensure that the shape of the fractured member does not change or that the binding does not relax; rectify all these things with your best effort. Make the patient's food on a gentle diet first, so that when the bone begins to harden, it will be easier to maintain.
It is necessary to thicken his food, for the arm and leg usually gain strength within forty days, at which point they should be relaxed, and a bath taken with suitable ointments applied. If the fracture is severe and dislocated.
Do not remove the bandage from him for fifty days or two months.
Chapter XII.
In setting a broken arm.
The arm consists of two bones, called the humerus, one smaller than the other, with the smaller one attached to the thumb, and the larger one located below it. It is possible for either the larger humerus or the smaller one to break, or both may be fractured simultaneously.
When the smaller upper humerus breaks, its healing is easier and quicker. In contrast, when the lower humerus fractures, the recovery process is more difficult and prolonged. The worst case scenario occurs when both bones break simultaneously, with the healing being the most challenging and time-consuming.
When a doctor sets a broken arm, they should make the healing process as gentle as possible to align the bones correctly. If the larger humerus is fractured, the stretch should be more severe. However, if both humeri are broken, the stretch should be significantly stronger.
The hand should be positioned when setting and extending it on a cushion, with the thumb above all the fingers and the little finger below all the others, while the patient is in a seated position, square on their own body.
And let the cushion be at his side in terms of height so that the patient does not exert themselves.
Then, the attendant extends the arm from below with either their hand or a bandage, and another attendant extends it from above. The physician then adjusts the bone until it is in the best possible shape, and if there are fragments in the broken bone, they are reduced.
Adjust each fragment to its place with all your effort. If a fragment has separated and is causing the skin to be pinched, making it impossible to set, cut it off along the line of the fracture, as we have mentioned previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we will discuss it in a separate chapter.
If, during your initial setting of the fracture, a hot swelling appears, apply a compress with a cloth soaked in a mixture of rose oil and white wax, which should be neither too thick nor too thin, and secure it gently. Once the swelling subsides, release the compression.
Remove the compress and apply a new one made from powdered chalk on a fine linen cloth, mixed with egg white. Then take up the splints. In most cases, there will be six splints: three for each arm. Ensure that the splint placed directly over the fracture is slightly wider and stronger than the others.
When the fracture is in one bone or in both bones, then make your traction stronger and more forceful on the site of the fracture. As you rotate the traction upwards or downwards, slightly relax the tension as mentioned earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
And let the bandage wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not too stiff. The thread used to tighten it should be of a special kind of canvas, intermediate between softness and hardness, as we described. Check the member and ligament after several days.
If something requires repair, such as itching in the member, it should be soaked in warm water until the itching subsides. Leave the member unstressed for a night to rest, then continue with the traction.
If the traction has relaxed and the bone has shifted or similar, correct all of it to the best of your ability. Also, check if food is unable to reach the member due to excessive tension; in this case, slightly loosen the traction and leave it for several days until blood flow resumes, then tighten it again.
If the patient does not exhibit any of what we mentioned, no treatment should be initiated for 20 days or so. Then, hang the patient's hand from their neck and ensure their arm is relaxed. The patient should conserve their energy and avoid abrupt movements, keeping their sleep on their back.
Know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps even in twenty-eight, all depending on the conditions of the humours and the strength.
Chapter XIII.
In setting a fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpal bone of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers are rarely fractured, but they are frequently subjected to contusions. If a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand, it is necessary to treat it accordingly.
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair placed before him at the same level.
Then he places his hand over it, extends the broken bone's assistant, and the doctor aligns it until it heals properly. If no swelling occurs, then a splint should be applied, followed by a cast above, according to the location.
It should be wrapped in a soft cloth, and if the fracture is towards the palm, make a semi-sphere with a cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then secure it with a long strip of cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather that conforms to the curvature of the hand and secures it as it should, if the fracture is protruding, a splint should be placed above and another below on the hand so that the hand remains open and straight.
Then, the tension should be carried as the hand rotates, and the fingers should be interwoven with bindings, if the fracture affects one of the phalanges, the thumb should be adjusted as it should be, then secured with the hand, and if desired, a small upright splint can be made to stabilize the fracture.
If it does not move, if the fracture affects any of the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or pinky finger, they should be aligned and secured with the adjacent healthy finger, or all tied together in order, which is better, or a small upright splint can be placed on them.
As we mentioned regarding the thumb, during the splinting process, check for any swelling and, after it subsides, apply the appropriate treatment as described previously, when any of these conditions occur.
Chapter XIV
In the splinting of a thigh fracture.
The thigh bone is often broken and is easily felt because it can move forward and backward. Its splinting involves tying a band above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies on their face.
Then, each servant tie should be extended to its side in moderation, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft tie should be tightened, either from wool or similar material.
If the fracture is at the origin of the thigh, extending towards the groin, one tie should be above and another below the fracture; similarly, if it is near the knee, the tie should be close to the knee, allowing for extension downwards. Then, the physician should adjust the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well when, in the absence of swelling or heat, it should be bandaged and secured. If a hot swell occurs, leave it for several days until the heat subsides, then proceed with treatment.
As for securing it, a wide, hard bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or three times, leaving enough space. Then, the leg should be twisted until the heel is at the origin of the thigh, and a long thread should be inserted between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread brought up from above on both sides.
Then, the remaining bandage should be wrapped around the leg and thigh, placing splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture. A single brace should then be made on the femur, and the space between the thigh and leg filled with soft cloth to ensure even tension.
Then begin by tightly binding the middle portion around the fracture site, three or four times, and as you move further away from the fracture with the bandage, make your tension less, softer, and looser.
Then proceed to the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie it to the subsequent bandages above, then pass the ends of the thread downwards until it ends at the heel of the man, and also tighten the ends of the bandages on the other side with it.
To prevent the bandage from slipping out of place, keep tightening it as long as there is no pain, swelling, or any other signs of damage to the member. If anything like that occurs, hurry to loosen it and rectify all such occurrences as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that protrudes, you should smooth it out if possible, otherwise make a cut and remove it, treating the wound as previously mentioned until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be secured without adding the leg with bandages.
As we mentioned regarding the arm and forearm, except that its fracture should not cause any permanent disability or limp if treated this way, but if only the upper arm is bound without adding the leg, it is inevitable that the patient will always walk with a limp.
Know that the thigh (muscle) strengthens in approximately fifty days or slightly more, or slightly less, all depending on the variations of temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter XV.
On the fracture of the knee joint.
The knee joint is rarely subjected to fracture, but it may be bruised extensively. If a fracture does occur, it is either a tear or fragmentation of its parts, which can happen with or without an accompanying wound.
You should assess all of this by touch, and realign the detached parts with your fingers until they come together and heal, to the best of your ability, gentleness, and skill. Then, you may apply a bandage and use a rounded splint if needed.
You should secure it with a suitable strap, and then monitor all the conditions described for other fractures, such as heat swelling and similar complications, addressing each occurrence with the appropriate treatment until healing is complete.
Chapter XVI.
On setting a broken leg.
The leg has two bones: one thick, called the tibia, and another thin, called the fibula, which can both suffer fractures similar to those of the arm's bones. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg will turn in all directions. If only the thinner bone breaks, the leg will turn forward. If the thicker bone breaks lower down, it is self-evident.
One should use traction, compression, and splints accordingly, but if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the traction should be less and lighter, and one must exert gentle force when treating it.
In the leg, there is an additional step: after adjusting the splints and completing all your work, take two strips of pinewood, used for smoothing out floors placed between board gaps, or palm leaves, or similar materials, to fill any gaps.
Select strips that are slightly thick, not too thin, and make them the length of the leg from the knee to the ankle. Then, wrap each one with two turns of cloth, placing one around the leg and the other on the opposite side.
They should be from the knee to below the foot, and then tie the strips in three places on each side and in the middle. With this strapping, the leg is prevented from tilting to the right or left and is shaped well. A wooden splint, lengthwise along the leg, can also be used.
It is placed there to preserve it from movement, and this should be done most especially in the case of a fracture accompanied by a particular wound. Then, inspect the leg every day, attending carefully to any swelling or puffiness or other issues. If such a thing occurs, treat it as necessary until it heals, and the leg bone will mend in about thirty days or so.
Chapter XVII
On fractures of the leg bones and fingers.
As for the heel, it never suffers a fracture, while the leg bones may indeed fracture. The fingers also rarely suffer fractures; rather, they are most likely to be dislocated in most cases.
If a leg bone fractures and you observe that the bones have shifted, the patient should place their foot on the ground in an upright position as if walking. Then, you should place your foot on the raised portion of the bones and tread down and even them out.
Until they return to their proper positions, then take the bandage and splint, place a small board with two flat ends beneath the foot, and after wrapping it with cloth and using other necessary materials, tightly secure the foot.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage, for you will find the bones either straightened after having been broken or dislocated, and treatment should be as you observe. If some of the fingers are broken, set them and straighten them as described in the treatment of hand fractures.
Then make a splint for the broken finger, extending along the finger and slightly wider, and under the foot place the board as described and secure it tightly. If two or three or more bones are broken.
Make a splint for each finger, graded in size, using a soft cloth, and secure the board under the foot, with each end of the board's head projecting outside the sole of the foot to ensure proper support.
You should not forget to follow all that has been mentioned for various fractures, and address each symptom as it arises, using the appropriate treatment for each case.
Chapter XVIII.
In this chapter, the text discusses fractures specific to women (fractures of the hip bone and pubic bone) and men (mentioning a specific male fracture).
When the vagina of a woman is fractured, have her sit in a squatting position, then gently bend her towards her back, and have a midwife grip the posterior portion of her vagina. The midwife should then stuff cotton into the vagina until it is filled and becomes firm, resembling a ball.
Then, the woman should be shaken and her body raised slightly; thus, the cotton will emerge until it becomes like a ball at the entrance of the vagina, and the bone fracture will heal. Then, a poultice should be placed on her back. Whenever she wishes to urinate, the cotton should be gently removed so that she can do so.
You should return to the initial procedure, then go back to the first poultice, repeating this process for about seven days, and it will heal. If you wish, you can use a goat's bladder, attach a tube to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then, blow into the tube with force until the bladder inside the vagina is inflated. This will help the bone fracture heal. Afterwards, stuff it with cotton and maintain this for several days as described until it heals. For a broken pubic bone in men or women, this method can also be used for healing.
This should be done as described for the hip bone, and the correct approach is evident to anyone familiar with this rare type of fracture. Especially for those with experience and understanding of these texts, the nature of the fracture itself often provides a clear indication.
Proceed with the correct method for its repair and stabilization. If a man's phallus breaks, insert a section of an ostrich's throat, then cover it with a piece of cloth and wrap it tightly. Leave it in this state for about three days or so until it heals.
Chapter XIX.
In the treatment of fractures with associated wounds.
One who presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur or humerus or similar, should immediately proceed to reduce it if the conditions for reduction are met as we have previously mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, one should immediately apply crushed glass (or similar material) to stop the bleeding, and then proceed with reducing the fracture on that same day, without delay.
If a hot swelling does not occur, but a warm swelling does, leave the reduction until the ninth day, until the warm swelling subsides, and do not attempt to reduce it on the third or fourth day, as it may result in severe complications.
If the broken bone exposes itself through the skin, one should attempt to reduce and set it with their hands gently and a slight pull, but if this is not possible, use a device made of iron, about seven or eight fingers long, to achieve reduction. And position it according to the extent of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should choose three or four, according to what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture, and they should be rounded with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when pressed upon during surgery.
They should be pointed at the end, with a bend at that tip, and the upper part should be thick while the lower half is very thin, and this is its form: .
They are called in Greek "perim" and refer to a small lever; it should be used by pressing its sharp, bent end onto the edge of the bone fragment, pushing once to align the bones slightly.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, cut off that part of the bone so that the instrument can reach it; if the bone cannot be aligned as described above, cut it with a similar-shaped incision as mentioned.
Or use a saw to cut it as best you can, then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone; if, after aligning the bone, the patient feels severe, painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, as this will greatly benefit the patient; if the bone healing is complete, soak a cloth in a contracting, black, special solution, especially in summer, and do not place any bandages or oily substances on the wound.
To prevent putrefaction and decay, then use bandages when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by making a hole in the bandages with scissors to match the size of the wound.
Be extremely careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as this has often been done by ignorant physicians and has caused either death, gangrene, or a severe cough in their patients. Let your tightening be gentle and relaxing, contrary to the tightness of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or it is a large wound and you fear some of the ill symptoms we described, and there is pain in the area that is disturbing, then do not put bandages on it, and make for it wraps from strong cloth in the place where the bandages would be, and tighten it with these.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the cloth you put on it with a drink, and then use the twists and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the four-fold ointment and similar ones. You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every morning and evening until it heals, and you should position the limb so that pus can easily drain downward. If several days pass and the wound does not close and pus continues to flow, then know that there are small pieces of bone embedded in it.
It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe. If any of the shards have come out, extract and remove them. If some are not coming out and are causing pain by pricking the member, cut and pull them off in every way possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or an ulcer, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply the corresponding treatment described in its chapter.
And among what you should pay attention to and keep in mind: if a large bone breaks and is pressing on a member, such as the femur or upper arm, or any other large member, do not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often, this will lead to death. Leave it until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then, treat the wound if you see a place for treatment, otherwise leave it be.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications that occur as a result of certain fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near joints, disfiguring the member and possibly preventing it from performing its natural function.
If the complication is soft, use drugs that contract such as gum arabic, frankincense, myrrh, wormwood, and other similar substances, taking some or all of them and mixing them with a contracting solution or with egg whites or vinegar.
Carry the complication through compression, applying firm pressure and leaving it for a significant number of days without releasing it, then relaxing it and repeating the process until the complication disappears, or use a tight plate of lead as an alternative.
Lead has the property of dissolving all substances formed in the body. If the complication has hardened, intensified, and necessitates its removal, make a cut from above and remove the resulting fragment or scrape it with a scalpel until it disappears, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture when it heals and the member remains soft, deviating from its original state.
If a bone fracture heals while the member remains soft, weak, it is due to many causes. One of the causes is either the excessive untying and tying of ligatures in an improper manner, or the extreme tightening of ligatures to the extent that blood flow to the member is blocked, or excessive and unnecessary stretching, or excessive movements at the wrong time, or insufficient blood in the body of the patient.
To treat this, one must nourish the patient and enrich their body to increase blood flow, use baths, and bring joy and happiness, then apply pitch to the member, which will attract a great deal of nourishment to it or maintain its stretching with warm water. until blood flow is established and it returns to its natural state.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of broken bones that are bent out of shape and prevent proper function.
When a member that has been set after healing from a broken bone shows signs of bending, or the fractured bone has healed in an awkward position, or it becomes deformed and ugly as a result. Unless the member still cannot perform its natural function, one should not accept claims that it is necessary to break the bone again from the top, as many ignorant physicians and splint-makers have done in our country.
This action is very much condemned and leads to great uncertainty, the least of which is injury. However, if the deformity and complexity are fresh, it should be washed with water that has been used to cook herbs such as plantain leaves, its root, laurel crown, and so on.
It is bandaged with relaxing compresses such as well-made diachيلون or the sap of plantain roots is taken, mixed with chicken fat and goat butter, and used as a compress, or thick figs are taken, ground with pigeon droppings and other medications called "nucile emollients.
The deformity dissolves with constant, gentle rubbing with the hands, using movements of the affected member at all times. If the deviation is old, severe, and calcified, and needs to be treated with iron.
It should be incised above, releasing the bone connection and cutting what remains of the deformity or bone with delicate cuts, using gentleness and care in this process. Then, treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw, when dislocated, obstructs movement, deforming the member and causing severe pain and discomfort to the patient. Whenever either of the jaws is dislocated, it should be immediately attended to for its reduction.
Do not delay it at all, for if it delays the swelling of the area, making the jaw difficult to move, it should not be delayed or moved during its swelling, as it often causes the patient pain and severe discomfort.
However, if this occurs, one should promptly drain the patient and then leave it until the swelling subsides slightly, then apply hot water and fat to the member and gently return it to its place, treating each member as mentioned in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to what was previously discussed on fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
Chapter XXIV
In the treatment of the lower jaw (fek al-laha al-sufla)
It is rare that the jaws move, and their extraction occurs in one of two ways: either they slip slightly from their positions, relaxing somewhat, or they are completely and fully dislodged, also resulting in relaxation. It is directed towards the chest, causing the patient to drool and unable to hold it, or to close their jaw, and their tongue stumbles over words. If the dislocation is slight, in most cases, it may return on its own with minimal effort.
And if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced swiftly without delay, and this is achieved by a servant gripping the head of the patient, while the physician inserts his thumb into the origin of the jaw within the mouth, on one side.
Or, if the dislocation affects both sides of the jaw, he should insert both thumbs and all other fingers from outside to adjust it, and command the patient to relax his jaws and let them move freely in all directions, while the physician realigns the jaw and pushes it back to its proper position.
If returning the jaw is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use a hot water compress and fat until they become easier to manipulate, without delaying their reduction as we have mentioned. Once both jaws return to their proper position and the patient's mouth is closed and relaxed, then apply strips of cloth with beeswax and rose oil.
Then, gently bind it with a loose bandage, and have the patient sleep on his back with his head elevated on two pillows to prevent any movement to the right or left, and avoid any effort in chewing, ensuring his food is soft.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw heals, he may eat as he pleases but should do so gently, avoiding any strain on opening his mouth while eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw fully recovers.
If the jaws cannot be restored to their original position after detaching, leading to persistent inflammation, constant headaches, abdominal distension, or frequent vomiting, the patient is considered compromised.
And often, those affected will die within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
In the reduction of the jaw, shoulder, and acromion.
As for the clavicle, it does not detach from the inside due to its connection to the chest, but it can detach externally, which is apparent to the touch. It must be set while the patient lies on their back and extends their arms.
Then, you press the site with your hand firmly, and it will return. Next, apply a bandage and splints and tighten them. The end of the clavicle adjacent to the shoulder and connected to it rarely detaches, but if it does, it should be reduced and aligned as mentioned above.
Then, apply a bandage, splints, and tension, and instruct the patient to remain motionless and at rest until they recover. With this very treatment, the shoulder joint can also be reduced if it has detached.
Chapter XXVI.
In the reduction of the shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: downwards towards the armpit, towards the chest, or, less commonly, upwards over the acromion.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder or in front of the nerve, but most commonly it comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with thin flesh, as it exits and enters quickly.
As for those with thick flesh, the opposite occurs; it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty. Sometimes a person might suffer a blow or fall, causing the shoulder to swell and feel hot, leading one to think it is dislocated; therefore, it should be examined to confirm its condition.
Then, you should proceed with the treatment, and identify the dislocation by comparing the injured shoulder with the healthy one; you will find a clear difference, and upon examining the area near the armpit, the head of the shoulder bone will feel depressed, like an egg when pressed.
The patient is unable to raise their hand to their ear or move it through all its movements; likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or over the acromion, this will be clearly visible to anyone.
And if the jaw is soft or the patient is a child, then it can be reduced by having a servant raise his hand above, and you place your thumbs under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully back to its position, while the servant raises his hand and extends it above.
Then, by gently lowering it, it will quickly return. If it does not return as mentioned and the jaw has been dislocated for a long time, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxants such as cooking roots of fennel, fenugreek, and royal crown in water.
Then the patient lies on his back, and a woolen ball is placed under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard. The doctor then places his hand on the ball and takes the patient's hand in his own, extending it downward.
He pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its original position. Alternatively, you can reduce it by bringing in a taller assistant who stands on one side of the patient, places his elbow under the patient's armpit, and raises the armpit upwards, suspending the patient in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand towards his lower abdomen. If the patient is lightweight, something heavier should be hung to make him heavier, and the jaw will return on its own. It may also be reduced in a different manner.
It is to focus on the ground a long wooden rod with a rounded head like the pestle, neither thick nor thin, and place it under the armpit of the patient after placing a soft cloth over the head of the rod while the patient stands along the length of the rod.
Then he extends his hand downward on the other side and also extends his body from the other side with force, and the joint will quickly return to its place. If it is difficult to restore it using all that has been mentioned, use this treatment: take a wooden rod about two arms' length. It should be four fingers in width and two fingers in thickness, with a rounded head to easily enter the armpit as shown.
Then, wrap a soft cloth around the rounded head to prevent damage to the rod. Position it under the armpit and extend the entire hand and arm downward on the rod, then secure the rod to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist.
Then, place the arm on a support. Pull the hand downward while keeping the rest of the body suspended from the other side; the joint will naturally enter its place. Once it is in place, one should put a moderately sized ball of wool under the armpit.
Then, take the prepared bandage made from flour, frankincense, and egg white, and apply it to the entire shoulder. Tighten the ball under the armpit securely and wrap the bandage around it from above, then hang the patient's hand on their neck.
He should rest his hand for seven days, and the patient's diet should be light to strengthen the member, thus aiding its recovery. After seven or five days, the limb can be moved; if it holds firm and does not weaken, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another condition, then the three-fold burn should be applied as mentioned in the chapter on burns. If you do all this and after seven days the joint does not hold firm.
If you have re-dressed and bandaged it multiple times, but the joint does not hold, becomes weak, and cannot be raised, then know that the nerve at the top of the shoulder socket is either severed, stretched, or relaxed; in which case the joint will never stay in place.
As for the jaw that is positioned towards the chest and breasts, and which can be moved by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, all forms of tension and treatment should be applied to it until it heals. If, after healing, a sensation persists in the member and its movement slows down.
The patient should frequently use the bath until the sensation in the member softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter 27
In the treatment of the dislocated shoulder.
The shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and returns with difficulty, moving in all directions, particularly forward or backward. Its dislocation is evident to the eye and can be felt by touch, revealing its shape.
If you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, you will notice a distinct indentation in the joint, preventing the arm from bending and the shoulder from moving freely, as if there is no contact with the acromion (the bony ridge at the top of the shoulder). It is imperative to act swiftly and reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling occurs, it makes the reduction of the dislocation difficult, and in some cases, it may never heal completely, especially if the dislocation is backward. This type of dislocation is the most severe and painful, often leading to death.
If reduction is possible, the assistant should extend both hands and arms fully, while the surgeon applies pressure from above and below the dislocation using the tips of his fingers or the palm of his hand, until the joint returns to its proper position.
If the dislocation is forward, it can be reduced by bending the hand once and striking the acromion with the palm of the hand, or by having two assistants stretch the arm strongly until the joint returns to its place. If this does not work, a stronger force may be applied by having two assistants stretch the arm vigorously.
The patient also has two assistants so that he does not slip at the time of stretching, then the arm is turned in every direction after it is wrapped around his hand with a folded cloth or a wide bandage, and if the doctor begins to treat the joint with his hands, he cleans them with oil to facilitate the movement of the joint.
Then the joint is pushed firmly until it returns, and after its return, one should apply a bandage with compression and drying, along with egg white, and tighten it tightly and suspend the arm from the patient's neck and leave it for several days.
Then, if the joint remains in place, release the bandage and leave it, but if you see that the joint has not strengthened, reapply the bandage and bandage again and leave it for several days until it strengthens, then release it. If any pain occurs after the joint returns and its release, treat it accordingly.
If there is difficulty in movement, use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and squeezing until it softens, or place a fat goat's skin over the joint and bind it, leaving it on for a day and night, then remove it and immerse it in a bath, and if it sweats, rub the joint gently.
Then apply the skin over the joint again, once, twice, and a third time, while immersing it in the bath until it softens. If you prefer to place wet, thin cow manure with butter on it and tighten it, do this several times, for it will soften and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
In the treatment of wrist dislocation.
The wrist joint is often dislocated and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it should be reduced immediately upon dislocation to prevent the site from becoming stiff or developing a hot swelling.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a table, have a helper extend the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand on the joint, pushing it back until it is reduced, but ensure that the dislocation has returned to the palm side of the hand.
The patient should place the palm of their hand on the board during extension and flexion, if the dislocation is visible on the back side of the hand, they should place the inside of their hand on the board so that the physician's hand can be placed on the same joint. If it reduces immediately, wrap it tightly with compressive bandaging to prevent re-dislocation.
Do not attempt to reduce it again, as it will not yield and you will not be able to do so after several days have passed. If the joint remains dislocated but the patient is not experiencing pain or cannot flex their hand, there is no harm done.
When it is discovered that a nerve has been severed or damaged, there is no other course of action but to cauterize it. Sometimes this can be effective, sometimes not. Once the wrist is healed, apply the dressing as described and secure it, leaving it for five days.
Then the hand should be moved and exercised. If its movement is difficult or there is any hardness, it should be softened with warm water and frictioned repeatedly until it becomes flexible.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
If a finger becomes dislocated and turns in any direction, such that it points to the palm or the back of the hand, stretch the finger and push the joint with your thumb until it returns to its proper position. Then bind the top of the finger and hang it towards the side it had turned to.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it stands upright. If it is night, tie it as described previously. Continue to loosen it during the day, move it, and re-tie it at night, doing this for several days until it strengthens.
Similarly, if a finger becomes dislocated and turns towards the palm, tie it to point in that same direction and perform your initial procedure until it heals. Do the same for any other direction it may turn.
Chapter Thirty
In the treatment of a spinal vertebrae dislocation.
When a spinal bead becomes completely dislocated or numerous beads have moved from their positions, treatment is not possible as death approaches the patient rapidly.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool exits without control, unable to hold it, and often some of their members relax, either both legs or arms, or one of them, and if only one bead moves from its position, it often detaches.
It can detach in four directions, if it moves towards the back, it is called a hunch. Its treatment involves examination; if the hunch occurred during childhood, there is no cure and it will never improve. However, if it resulted from a fall or blow, etc.,...
He has mentioned these treatments in detail in various ways, but much of it is not beneficial. I have condensed the essential points from his explanations and descriptions, presenting a simplified version of the techniques.
I say that the hunch occurring at the front of the chest, or on both sides, is incurable and beyond any remedy. However, the one that appears in the back can be treated by placing the patient face down.
On a bed placed near a wall, the patient lies with their chest supported by a moist pad to prevent injury, then a vertical wooden pole is inserted into a hole in the ground at one end of the bed nearest the head, and another wood at the opposite end towards the feet on the other side of the bed.
And a server holds the pole, not fixed in the hole, and another server holds the other in the same manner, then they wrap around the patient's chest and under their armpits with a tight, soft cloth, and extend the cloth's end to the pole at the head and tie it there.
Then, another cloth is tensioned over their hips and above their knees and at their ankles, and all the bindings are gathered and tied to the other pole at their feet, then each server extends their pole with the binding towards their respective side without moving the poles from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed as we said, and the physician places their hands on the poles with force until they return, or places a board on top of them and leans on it with his legs until they return. If this treatment does not work, take a board that is about three arms long.
A space is dug in the wall, as we mentioned, close to the patient, into which one end of the board is inserted. Then, the middle of the board is placed on the hump, and the physician places his legs on the other end, tightening it well to compress the pole.
Return it to its place, or if you prefer, make it with a spiral twisted by hand; this involves driving into the ground at the head of the patient on one end of the bed two wooden poles of a length equal to a arm, and at his feet on the other end of the bed also two wooden poles.
And after that, between each pole, a space of one span should be left, and in each pole a hole made, through which the spiral is passed and all the poles are firmly fixed in the ground so as not to move at all; then a round stick, which is the spiral, is inserted into the holes of both poles.
At the end of it, a hole is made in which a stick one span long is inserted and twisted; likewise, in the other two poles. Then the bandage that was tied on the chest of the patient is tightened around the spiral at his head, and the bands that were tied on his legs are tightened around the spirals at his feet.
Then, at each spiral, a servant stands and twists his hand with the tool that twists the spiral, while the doctor adjusts the curve as previously described. And this is a picture of the spiral, the bed, and the patient: .
Then, after the spine is in place and the position is even, the dried bandage made from egg whites should be applied, followed by a splint; then, a board of approximately three fingers width and length enough to cover the hump should be placed on top of the bandage.
And then, after some correct stitching, it should be bound with the appropriate bandage and the patient should be given soft food until they recover. If there remains some scar tissue at the site even after recovery, medications that relax and soften should be used along with the board which we have described in detail before.
A lead plate may also be used for this purpose, and sometimes a scar tissue can remain after the last stitches of the back, leading one to suspect a dislocation, which could be an excess bone that has formed, so do not attempt this treatment, as it might result in death.
Chapter Thirty-One
In the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the elbow joint only become dislocated, not subjected to the slight displacement and deformity as other joints do; and the hip joint can dislocate in four ways.
This is because the hip joint can dislocate towards the inside, outside, front, or back; however, it most commonly dislocates inward, and seldomly towards the front or back. A sign that the joint has dislocated inward is when, by comparing the healthy leg to the affected leg, the latter appears shorter.
The knee is bent more than it should be, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the thigh. The area following the thigh is clearly swollen, as the head of the femur has moved there.
When the jaw deviates outward, the symptoms are opposite to these, and when it deviates forward, it extends the leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he attempts to walk, he is unable to do so forward.
It causes urinary retention, swelling in the thigh, and when walking, he bears weight on his heels. When the jaw deviates backward, it does not extend the knee or bend it without first bending the thigh, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
The thigh is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly in the position of the hip belt. As for the correction of this type of jaw, if it has been old and attached to its owner and has not attempted to return to its proper place, remaining in its condition, then there is no treatment at all.
One should not attempt to treat it, but if the jaw is recently dislocated and of any of the four types, then hurry to twist the joint, stretch it inward and outward, and move it right and left. Perhaps...
Return and do not require other treatment, if not, then you should consider a strong aid to extend his leg from below, either by hand or by a cloth bound above the knee on his leg, and another helper extends him from above.
He should insert his hands from under his armpits, then tighten a soft cloth at the base of the thigh, and another helper, a third, holds the end of the cloth, either extending it from the front, from the groin to the shoulder, or from behind, towards the back.
They should all be extended at once until the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of extension is common to all four cases. If the jaw returns as we have said, otherwise each case requires the specific treatment I have mentioned.
As for its specific return, if the jaw is drawn in, the patient should lie on his right side, then a cloth should be wrapped at the base of the thigh between the head of the femur and the place below the groin.
Then the strap is extended above, from the groin to the top of the body, towards the shoulder, and another strong helper uses both his arms to embrace the thick part of the thigh of the patient and extends it outward with a strong pull, returning it to its place.
This is the easiest type of treatment among all other treatments that aim to restore this member, if it is impossible for you or it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then both legs of the patient should be bound with a strong yet soft bandage around the ankles and knees.
It should be positioned so that each one is separated by the width of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended further than the other by two fingers. Then the patient should be suspended from a beam in the house, at a distance of two arms' length from the ground.
Then you command a strong boy to embrace the thigh, while another boy holds onto the patient, and the latter pushes the former with force. The joint will quickly return to its place. If it dislocates completely, a special effort will be required to reduce it.
The patient should lie on the bed, as described for the hunchback, with a bandage tightly wrapped around his affected leg and chest. Two beams are placed, one at each end of the bed, with an additional beam across the middle, all secured firmly.
A damp cloth should be wrapped around them to prevent any harm, with a beam placed between his thighs to prevent him from sinking downward during the procedure. Each assistant should then pull towards their respective side, while the doctor adjusts the hip with his hands, and if it returns to its place.
And if it is decided to dislocate it forward, the patient's leg should be extended once while he lies on his healthy side, as mentioned regarding the humped rib.
The surgeon places the palm of his right hand on the affected thigh and presses it with his left hand, but the pressure should be extended downwards towards the knee, if the dislocation is to the rear, the patient should not extend downward.
He should be raised above the ground, rather, he should be placed on a solid surface, and as mentioned, his hip joint should be dislocated outward while he lies face down on the bench with his ligaments tightened.
As mentioned earlier, the dislocation should be corrected by using a board on the area where the joint has moved, once the hip joint returns to its proper place, the sign of its return will be clear, which is when the patient's leg extends.
If you see both legs level and the patient is able to contract and extend their leg without difficulty, then know that the joint has returned to its proper place. At this point, align the femurs, secure the bandage, and tightly wrap a compress around it so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient should rest for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and check the leg. If they are equal in size, know that the fracture is stable, release the patient to walk, but if you see any signs of relaxation, be cautious.
Then, dress and bind it as you initially tightened it, leaving it for three more days, then loosen it and let the patient walk slowly on it for several days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter II and III.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward), but never forward. The indication of its dislocation is to order the patient to draw their leg towards their thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. To reduce it, sit the patient down with their legs extended if they can do so, and have a servant sit behind them, grasping their midsection and gently leaning them backward slightly, then you will sit on their thighs.
Press your back against his, placing the patient's leg between your legs, then grasp their knee with both hands and interlace your fingers around it. Press firmly with your hands while another assistant extends the patient's leg until the knee returns to its socket.
The sign of its healing is when the leg adheres to the thigh in a soft, non-forced manner, then bandage it and adhere the leg to the thigh, then tie them all together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them, and do not use walking except for a few days until it strengthens.
If it is not possible for her to return as described, otherwise use the strong traction with bandages that we have described in the treatment of the hip until she returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of the ankle joint.
The ankle joint may come loose partially or completely, and its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle bone protruding and prominent towards the side it has moved to.
As for its treatment, it is easy to reduce it by gently pulling with the hands and aligning it until it returns. However, if it dislocates completely, the patient should sit down, and a strong servant should hold him from behind, in the middle of his back, to help reduce the joint.
Then, hold his foot with your right hand at the top and your left hand at the bottom in the area of the ankle. Pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then extend it with your left hand, gently pushing the foot's front towards the thigh without force.
Make these two movements as described, and then in the third instance, push the foot towards the leg while pulling on the heel. If it returns once or twice after following this method and you observe the foot to be level, then repeat the procedure; otherwise, begin again.
If the foot does not return as described, place the patient on their back on the ground and insert a peg firmly into the earth between their thighs, wrapping it with cloth to prevent injury, then have an assistant secure the patient's thigh.
Then, have a second assistant extend the patient's leg either by hand or with a strap tied around the patient's neck, extending it against the first assistant's pull while the peg remains between the patient's thighs to prevent the body from tilting downward. The physician then adjusts the jaw with their hands.
Have a third assistant hold the healthy leg downward, and if the jaw returns quickly, indicating its proper alignment, then secure the bandage and splint tightly with straps, binding the foot to the leg below the ankle, while taking care to avoid the nerve located behind the heel.
To prevent the bandage from being too tight and causing injury, leave it for two or three days. If the bandage relaxes, tighten it again, then release it on the fourth day or after thirty days, after which the patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If one attempts to walk before this period has passed, there is a risk that the jaw will dislocate and become damaged, and it will not respond to treatment afterwards. If a hot swelling appears, one should use what we have described in our treatments and bandages elsewhere until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of a man's finger dislocation.
One should straighten what has come apart with a slight stretch, without force, which is easy to do. If the dislocation is in one of the toes, the patient should place their foot on a level surface.
Or, while he stands on a board, you should place your foot on the joint and press down firmly with the other foot until it aligns and appears straightened without any bumps.
Then, place a board under the sole of his foot, covering the entire foot, with two heads, and secure it tightly for three days. After that, release it and protect his foot from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are confident that it will not relapse, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In Types of Jaw That Are Affected by Injury or Fracture or Both.
When such conditions occur, whether due to injury, fracture, or both, their treatment and reduction must be handled with care, as they often lead to death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless they are skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, and cautious, and begin with drugs that soothe hot swelling only and carefully observe the patient.
O God, save us from harm except as we hope for safety with a mild illness and some hope appears to You therein; then reduce it at once in Your time before the hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns as intended, use measures to soothe hot swelling and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the jaw is fractured and there are protruding fragments of bone, then extract them. Follow what we have mentioned for simple diseases, as outlined in their respective sections.
Exert your utmost effort and purify yourself from venturing into risky paths, as I have advised you; this will preserve your honor and protect your reputation, God willing.
