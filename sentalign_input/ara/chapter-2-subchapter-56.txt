Chapter Fifty-Six.
On pustules that occur on the foreskin and penis, and blackness, and corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This pustule often appears in the urethra, and it is a vile fleshy growth, and there is a malignant and non-malignant type of it, so the non-malignant one should be hung with a fine hook.
And cut it until you have cleaned it all, then apply cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment to it, then treat it afterward with palm ointment until it heals.  But if the pustule is malignant, vile in color, then cauterization should be used on it after cutting and scraping it.
If the pustule is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised boy, and some of the pustule is on the inside of the foreskin and some of it on the outside, then the pustule that is on the inside should be removed first, so that when it has healed, then treat it from the outside.
Because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure the foreskin will not be perforated.  Blackness and corruption can also occur on the labia and on the foreskin, and it is necessary to excise everything that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed.
Then apply honey to it afterward, with the sifted, pounded peels of pomegranate and frankincense, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it putrefies. If the glans is corroded and consumed in its entirety at some point, it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision. Adhesion can also occur from a wound or a tumor. It is necessary to dissect it with a blunt scalpel so that the adhesion is released and the glans is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish it completely, it is necessary to dissect some of the glans and some of the foreskin, because the foreskin is thin and may be quickly perforated due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat it with an astringent syrup until it heals.
