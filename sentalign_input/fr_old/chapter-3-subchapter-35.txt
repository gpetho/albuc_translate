Of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and it is to be restored, many times the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it long, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and cautious, not bold;
And use at the beginning things that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the patient in the hands of God if you see no hope of healing;
And when you see hope, set the limb back in place immediately, before the hot abscess occurs;
And when the limb is in place, administer things that soothe hot abscesses, and treat the wound as necessary with drying ointments;
And if there is a fracture with the dislocation, and small loose bones, remove them, and do as we have said for simple injuries;
And avoid acting out of fear, as I have said, for it will help you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and body. Amen
