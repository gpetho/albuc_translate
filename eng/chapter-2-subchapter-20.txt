 CHAPTER TWENTY.
On the reduction of exophthalmos.
 When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open.
Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads.
The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses.
Prepare a good many.
Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly.
Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification.
Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.
If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly.
Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said.
If you see that the eye has receded, good.
Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.
