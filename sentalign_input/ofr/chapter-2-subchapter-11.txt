of the hairs of the eyelids
When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and they become irritating, they harm the eyes, and cause various ailments such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugo, so much so that it causes the destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is described above in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by small tubes, as I will explain.
You must place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it is turned out, that is good; if not, insert a needle with a thread through it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow near these hairs, and pull a thread over it with the eyelid, and turn it towards the surgeon; then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the extra hairs, with the spatumile (spatula/scalpel) cutting, from the large tear duct to the small one; then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid a figure with ink, like a myrtle leaf, and yet it must be that the figure is according to the amount that you want to raise the eyelid which is divided entirely.
And there are some who need a large amount of the eyelid cut depending on how softened the eyelid is; then cut with the spatumile (spatula/scalpel) along the two lines that you have marked, and start from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs about the thickness of a hair, then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the heart shape, then peel it all off; then join the two edges with a suture using a needle with a fine woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and burn the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance if you want to do so; and if not, don't worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without stitching with drying and constricting agents, for the eyelid is raised by the healing of the wound and the joining of it, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another way: and that is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three hooks separated according to the form which is here:
then cut what is left over with small, even strokes, according to the form which is here:
And if you are unable to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread in it, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then join the two edges of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if an abscess develops at your incision, soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments; and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are turned inward: you must then use what we have said about the incision; but the suture in both cases is more sophisticated.
The treatment of the sloughs is as follows: you must turn the eyelid and cut it inside as I have said, and then make two sloughs artificially, and two thin ligatures as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatumile (spatula/scalpel); and cut at the two ends on the two sides where you hold the threads; then join one and the other subtly over what remains of the eyelid, and tighten the two sloughs on both sides firmly; and leave it like that for a few days, and the skin that was tightened will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, cut it with forceps, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound is healed, the eyelid will be raised, and the hairs will no longer prick; and this is the form of the two sloughs that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
