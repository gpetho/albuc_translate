On the treatment of abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter 36.
Sometimes swellings occur between the throat, that is, the glands, which resemble almonds, which happen externally: and they are called the two tonsils: when you treat them with what we mentioned in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If, therefore, the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, rather leave it until it matures.
And then you will either pierce it, or it will rupture on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And the procedure for it is, that you consider before the operation, if its abscess has quietly completed its warm inflammation, or if it has decreased to a certain extent: then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should rest in your lap: open his mouth, and let an assistant hold it between his hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, which has this shape.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a small knife.
Then, when you press the tongue down with it, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, without pulling with it any of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument, which has the following shape.
It resembles scissors: however, the ends of it should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly sharp towards the other: take care that it is made of Indian steel, or imbued with alfuled.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatumil, which has this shape.
It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, there occurs a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood stops: then treat it until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore cut them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed once treated a woman with an abscess, which had arisen between her throat, which had taken on a dark color, with little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed with difficulty through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached the point of death, if she had remained one or two more days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had sent out two branches, which extended over the two nostrils.
So I hurried quickly, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it.
Then I cut it off, where it extended from the nasal cavity.
Then I did the same for the one that extended from the other nostril.
Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue: and then I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed: the womanâ€™s throat was thus freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took some food.
Therefore, I did not cease cutting from that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess kept returning in the place where I had incised it, until it became very extended with her.
So I took a risk, and cauterized the abscess within the throat.
Then it ceased to increase: then I departed, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
