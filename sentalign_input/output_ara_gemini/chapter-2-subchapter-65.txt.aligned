The occurrence of this hernia is from a tear that happens in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the soft parts of the abdomen, so the intestine pours from that rupture to one of the two testicles, and this rupture can be either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.	This hernia is due to a split occurring in the membrane stretched from the hypogastrium over the belly in the region of the groin. Through this opening the bowel descends upon one of the testes; this opening is due to the membrane's splitting or stretching.	0.8072613
And these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and so on.	And these two kinds occur from a number of causes: from a blow or jumping or shouting, or lifting a heavy weight, or a similar cause.	0.86846673
And its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long period, and it does not happen suddenly, and the swelling will be level towards the depth because the peritoneum squeezes the intestine.	The symptoms of it, when it arises from a stretching of the membrane, are that it is a slow and chronic development and does not happen on a sudden, and the swelling is even and deep down, because the membrane is pressing the bowel.	0.71043825
And its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning it causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling will be distinct, appearing under the skin nearby, and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its passage outside the peritoneum.	When it is due to a split in the membrane, the signs will be that it starts with a sudden severe pain, and the lump varies in consistency, appearing close under the skin; that is due to the emergence of the bowel and its passage outside the membrane.	0.77080584
And the omentum might come out with the intestine, so this hernia is called intestinal and omental, and it may be with flatulence.	Sometimes also the omentum comes out with the bowel, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental; sometimes it contains wind.	0.7872219
And excrement might run in the intestine and be trapped there, so with it comes the demise of the patient because it causes difficult pain and rumbling, especially if squeezed.	Sometimes also the excrement comes down with the bowel and gets held up there, and this involves the patient's death, for thence arises an intractable pain and borborygmi, specially when pressed upon.	0.7758473
And the treatment of these types of illness with iron is dangerous, so one should beware of falling into it.	The treatment of the varieties of this disease with the knife is dangerous; so be cautious of rushing at it.	0.76721185
The method of operation is that you order the patient to return the intestine with his hand to inside his cavity, if it is possible to return, then he lies on his back between your hands and raises his legs, then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the testicle lengthwise, then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision as much as needed to open the incision with them, and the incision should be as much as the testicle can come out of.	The manner of operating is to bid the patient reduce the bowel back into the belly if it be disposed to return, then lie back before you and raise his legs. Then do you stretch upward the skin adjacent to the groin, and cut the whole length of the skin of the testicles; then attach to the edges of the incision as many hooks as are necessary to open the incision. The incision should be sufficiently large to allow the testicle to be drawn out.	0.9053899
Then you peel the peritoneal layers that are under the skin of the testicle until the hard white peritoneum is exposed from all sides, then insert your index finger next to the testicle between the white peritoneum that is under the skin of the testicle and between the second peritoneum, and release with it the adhesion that is behind the testicle.	Then dissect away the tissues that lie beneath the skin of the scrotum so that the hard tunica albugínea be exposed all round. Then introduce your forefinger in around the testis in the space between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second membrane, and with your forefinger free the attachment at the back of the testicle.	0.8502804
Then you bend with the right hand to inside the skin of the testicle, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with the left hand, and you raise the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision, and you order the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you release the adhesion that is behind completely, and you search with your finger so that there is nothing of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum, and if you find something of it, push it to the lower abdomen.	Then with your right hand explore within the scrotum and fold back the covering of the testicles, at the same time stretching the tunica albugínea upwards with the left hand, and bring the testis with the membrane up into the opening, and bid your assistant to stretch the testis upwards; and do you fully free it from the posterior attachment. Feel with your finger that there be no part of the intestine that has got twisted within the tough white membrane; and should you find any push it back into the abdomen.	0.87891626
Then you incise below the skin of the testicle an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously.	Then make a counter-incision in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, to let the blood and matter drain away as we bade you before.	0.824878
Then wool dipped in oil is used and placed in the wound, and the bandage that we described is used. And the white peritoneum that we mentioned may be cauterized after cutting it, as a precaution against bleeding, as this often happens.	Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and the bandage that we prescribed (sometimes also the white membrane that we spoke about is cauterized after the incision to forestall haemorrhage, for that usually happens) and let the ligatures be until they fall away spontaneously.	0.7896681
And you leave the bandage until it falls off on its own, and if its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water and something that makes him sweat should be applied to him until it falls off, then the wound is treated with all other wound treatments until it heals.	If they are slow in coming away, then foment with hot water and apply something to sweat them off. Then dress the wound in the usual manner until it heals.	0.62861764
