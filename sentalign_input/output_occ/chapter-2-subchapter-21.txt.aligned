On the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic. When there is a disruption in the uveal tunic, and it protrudes and projects outside the eyelids like a grape, and distorts a person's appearance, and you want to cut it, the operation is as follows: you insert the needle at the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread at the lacrimal part, make it penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; then cut the place of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it firmly.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe. You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place. Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.	0.9034453
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye and leave it until the thread and the uvea fall off.	Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.	0.86304677
Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.	0.90560186
Sometimes a large prominence forms in the eye and is attached all around with a circle of cloth, then it should be perforated with a fine instrument to come to the front of the eye, and let the white fluid flow, and the eye will descend and fit immediately.	Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased. Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once.	0.73732626
Then tighten until it is healed.	Then bandage till healed.	0.9055178
