On the cauterization of a cold liver.	On the cauterization of a cold liver.	1.0
When there is pain in the liver due to coldness or humidity or large amounts of gas, causing it to deviate from its normal state due to the expulsion of excesses, and the patient is not cured with the previously mentioned treatments, then the patient should lie on their back, and mark three cauteries in this form and this same amount on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human decubitus is.	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.	0.7246685
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be along the length of the body straight.	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body.	0.8096675
And do not compress the area too much with the cautery.	Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.5728313
And if the amount that is burned is the size of half the thickness of the tendon, and it should not be too tight; and if the patient is standing, then let them stand on their feet; if they are not standing, then they should lie down, with their legs extended and their arms raised.	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization. Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised. Figure of the cautery.	0.76309264
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery if you have the skill and prudence in the art.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.	0.8120022
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the whole thickness of the tendon be burned so that the entire body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the tendon here is delicate; and know this.	Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.8060127
