of albaras (white leprosy/vitiligo)
When the illness called "albaras" is chronic, and medical remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a shallow cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetches and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and lark blood, one part of each;
and mix it all together, and bind it with a cloth, and leave it on the spot until it is healed.
