When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it. Do this once or twice over.	When an abscess forms at the root of the gums, the palate, or the roots of the teeth, which produces pus, ruptures, and eventually ages, leading to a continual discharge of pus and the formation of a fistula, and if the treatment of it does not prove effective, then you must heat a cautery sized to fit the fistula. Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the hot iron reaches the depth and end of the fistula. Do this once or twice as needed.	0.9101623
Then afterwards treat as we have mentioned until it heals.	Then continue treating it afterward as we described in the treatment section until it is healed.	0.87080634
If the matter stops and it heals, well and good; otherwise it is impossible to avoid opening up the place and removing the diseased bone in the manner we shall speak of in its proper chapter.	If the discharge ceases and it heals, it will be good. But if it does not heal, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone as described in the relevant chapter.	0.77876437
