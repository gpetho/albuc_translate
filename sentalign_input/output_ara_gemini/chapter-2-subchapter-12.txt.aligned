If it is a hair or two, the procedure for that is to take a thin needle and insert in it a smooth, thin silk thread. Then bring its two ends together and tie them in a very gentle knot. And let the length of the thread be about a span.	If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.	0.87032056
Then attach to the loop another thin thread, shorter than it. And tie its ends if you wish.	Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish.	0.86117625
Then have the patient place his head in your lap and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is delicate work.	Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.	0.85670686
Then insert the needle with the loop at the base of the extra hair and pass it quickly through the eyelid until you bring it out from above the natural hair.	Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair.	0.950951
Then pull the thread over the loop and insert that hair into the loop, whether it is one or two or three, no more.	Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.	0.8887172
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair.	Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair.	0.93202865
If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.	If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.	0.92548954
Then put the hair back in it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you see it with your own eyes.	Then put the hair back in and draw them both up; keep on until the hair rises up in the upper perforation and you can see it.	0.8526895
Then release the loop and the thread and remove them. And tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and the flesh grows over it.	Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.	0.92632645
If the hair is short, then either add to it a long hair from the natural hair, so it will rise with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, then you can remove it.	If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.	0.8606823
