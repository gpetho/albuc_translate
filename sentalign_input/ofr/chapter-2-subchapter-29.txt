of the deaf
Sometimes there are gathered at the top of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough;
and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and green, so much so that the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
so you must have the patient sit between your hands, and his head be in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the scabs appear, until nothing remains there;
and do the same with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if what is there is removed on the first scraping, that is good;
if not, then begin scraping again the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything away;
and know that the teeth require various shapes of instruments for scraping, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one scrapes outside the teeth have other shapes than those with which one scrapes between the teeth;
and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
