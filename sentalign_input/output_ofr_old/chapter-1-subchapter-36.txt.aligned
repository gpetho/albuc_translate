When the patient cannot bear cutting or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such an illness arises that can only be healed by cautery.	When the patient will not submit to the cutting operation we have described in its own place, and is afraid of it, he may perhaps be cured with the cautery.	0.6714604
When someone develops a fistula, and it is aged and emits pus and corrupted fluids, you should probe it fully with a thin tent, and make sure you know, using the whole tent, how deep it is.	So when somebody gets a fistula, and pus and foul humidities have for a long while been running from it, you must first explore it with a fine probe and judge of its depth by the probe.	0.76344734
Then heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula to the depth the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, twice or thrice, according to the need; and be careful not to burn the nerves that are nearby, and the large veins.	Then heat a spike-shaped cautery and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, in the direction of the bottom of the fistula and to the depth to which the probe entered. And repeat the cauterization till all those corrupt bodies are burnt away; once or twice or three times over, as you have need. But beware of burning a nerve should one be there, or a big blood-vessel.	0.88120914
