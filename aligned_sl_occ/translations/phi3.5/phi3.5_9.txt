Oh children, you have completed this book of medicine with your own hands, which is on the other side of science and whose content I present to you through explanations, expositions, and declarations; it becomes clear to me that you understand this subject we are discussing today, from which surgery derives.
When the operation is prostrate in our region and at all times private, I am bound within it due to my knowledge of it; yet only small descriptions are found freely dispersed among Ancient texts, which I change into errors herein contained, and thus lengthen both body'diction (sic) and art.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And I have seen that you must vivify (revive or bring back) that order of this treatise in its second part according to exposure and declaration, as well as for preparation with these tools used by a cauterist and others necessary.
May be the reason why no one dares to remove a skilled artisan from their seat in our times, for medicine is an old profession that demands constant exercise within its science of anatomy—which knows Gualia inside out as she understands the functions and forms of these body parts; knowing joint connections and separations, bone structure, nerves, muscles (lacertz), names of all those things, pulsating veins and quiet vessels, places of their internal cleansing.
Through Aqua of Ippocrates who knows well by name the work and its parts, mostly in the manner or technique of touching.
May we already have this information about what was told us at the entrance of this free; those who do not know that which has been conveyed to them will err and serve death to men, even if they seem acquainted with some aspects of it, as these are formed in this science and taken from its knowledge and experiments.
Here is the translation line by line:
Here comes another doctor who ordered the patient to drink a stone of wine that had passed through his state, and this stone was large; it came down into him via an intestine's thread, so that by the third day he died.
And you call for its extraction hereby due to the greatness of the stone and because it has been lodged in a way under him that he will surely die.
And there comes another doctor who receives the salary of our duke here on this land for surgery; and he brings with him one that is black in color because it was used to fix his bone fracture, taking advantage of the surgeon'thy ignorance—he repairs the fracture outside (on the ground), using strong pillows and chairs, without allowing breath.
Here they apply the splint according to their wishes, and bind it securely with rope or bandage over several days' time as commanded by us; herein we enter until the thigh bone enters the fracture site, leading to disintegration (likely referring to healing).
And he was called hereby (or) unto us, and we prepared to loosen the ligature, which resulted in calmness and relief from their pains.
Even though there has been confirmed decay in the limb, it cannot be restrained and will continue to spread while under the malady'thy influence.
And another doctor pierced an abscess and it erupted within days, as his malevolence became apparent to the lord of him.
The cause is such that the head needs to be restrained due to melancholalgy humors from all over but only in one member where it was previously housed.
And for this reason, children, you must plan the operation in two ways: one is related to health (the surgical intervention), and another involves major precautions where there may be risk.

Here it seems that 'you' are being asked to consider or examine tools, specifically those associated with medical procedures.

It also implies the need for these specific instruments in some form of preparation – possibly related to surgery as

When you apply the quality of that cauterization and its hidden contents to it, and where such treatment is forbidden by complexity:
So it is said that the language of cautery and its obscurity is long and elaborate, subtle by science, with secrets hidden within; they speak much about these topics, and often disagree among themselves, enough for me to grasp only a small part of their discussions.
And thus it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two types of matter within its material, which are tail matters.
In the complex tail and dry matter they separate; those who use cautery are beneficial to it there, and others oppose that which is convenient in such illnesses where quality and dryness prevail – for nature of fire both has qualities and aridity, hence convenience lies in treating with water that separates itself into moisture and being quenched; this type of disease involving the tail (likely referring to a condition affecting specific body parts) requires such treatment.

Here is the line-bydependent translation of each segment from Latinate medieval language into English:
Mightily indeed, who heals that which has already been probed and exercised in the domain of cauterization for today'se practice, understanding both the complexity of human beings and their disposition towards diseases within them; as well as causes these afflictions have, and timing thereof.

May the medicine cause inflammation in that limb which was laid low by illness and difficulty of recovery, causing it to come back into life vigorously.
May the fire (which refers to applied heat therapy), because of its sublimation and beneficial substance, does not produce excess but rather aids in healing E even now we have come down to you through experiment and long service as students at this art concerning truth about causes; thus they excuse us from lengthy speech (the treatment method). And while here I am temporarily restrained with these concealed secrets of the focus, which demonstrates its operative effect in limbs and expulsion of diseases—a philosophical discourse shown through our bodies' pains.
And learned men, who understand when it is most suitable for performing cauterizations and intermittent stops of bleeding during the first month after birth.
E you say that cautery is convenient at all times, for it draws the harmful water into which the cautery is applied, and mostly when dealing with pains or necessary interventions such as fractures and wounds; these do not delay because of fear of those spirits whose evil magic causes further damage—indeed, a small ongoing injury may be lesser than potential greater harm.
So do not hurt your feet or legs; these are where the common people and unlearned physicians believe it to be caused by a wicked crowd and ignorant healers, so that curing with cautery cannot completely eliminate this illness, nor can pauses stop its consequences.
The cause is not due to excessive drinking where the poultices are applied, for cauterys in medicine alter complexity and dry out these moisture-producing causes that bring about pain.
Even though there are unnecessary cautions above medicine due to the patient's wellbedict and operation grandeur of their lord, it is important for proper treatment.

When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain due to an enlarged spleen (maula), using knives and cups, cappings and liniments, ointments and poultices among other things; most importantly if any cautery has already been applied on one of these causes, consider that the head's swelling is due to excessive bone growth in its nature. It should not be harsh or abusive treatment as such does no good for it—therefore apply another form of cauterization thereon. (Here "le maula" refers to what was traditionally understood by the term 'spleen' within medieval medical practice, though this terminology can vary from contemporary understanding.) Return that over the patient's head for burning (cauterizing) purposes, while ensuring it remains within where the spinal column has been divided. Cut the ribcage and expose the bone as much as we have counted previously; apply that instrument there on the back part of the head where it is applied (the place to which air has accumulated), — this location in which they stop blowing with a ventouse. And apply pressure with your hand firmly, and do not discover the bones beneath; for the humors have inflicted great pain different from that of other brandishers on the head.

Of ancient non-antidotal cautioning.
When severe pain occurs in the head or when it is stretched out (torticollis), both extract with medicine the hardness of the skull and administer other treatments; thus without proper understanding you cannot cure them unless by: either a combustion-based medicinal cauterization, or one made from iron.

When you treat ancient migraine (or other ailments), taking into account the remedies previously discussed for these conditions and not profiting from them, especially when it is not sufficient to apply heat as with cauterization at its initial stage or focal point—whereby this refers either to external application of medicinal fire/cauterization points outside (implied by "cutellar") on the site of longstanding pain and wherein lies the matter's origin, stopping there for some time; meanwhile placing your hand within thresholds with an intermittent touch through which you can convey heat or cauterizing substance.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw joint, which grinds your teeth (bruxism), and that the temporomandibular ligament not become tightened nor does the nerve associated with this cause cramping or spasms.
If it is about the custody and caution of the sanctity of blood flow from the artery, there is fear in its abcession, mostly to that which ignores what flows and does not study or examine; thus perform the operation with care.
When it is time for recalling the flow of sickness from the humors according to the doctor'thy methodology in this place free from illnesses.
If the malady does not supply this cautery and affects only part of the affected area (head), then heat it there where we have mentioned previously, and care for the patients until they are healed.
If you come, administer the same tool we have discussed in our meeting of acute inflammation treatment using two lancets for cauterization; this is considered better and even more effective therapy.
Capital punishment (as indicated by "Capitol") is referenced
For alleviating the pains of joints, specifically referring to curative measures for pain caused in areas like fingers or toes ("aurella" could refer here
When in the finger there is pain due to cold and frostbite (implying that these are considered causes of joint or bone discomfort), it's addressed with treatments targeting the root cause as I mentioned earlier. It isn’t meant for mere temporary relief, but rather through specific cauterization methods—this is what has been discussed in terms of treatment here:
Return the points made with fire or cautery and carry it throughout the entire body area where there is pain, either by turning a wheel over this part as if you are stirring (perhaps implying movement of instruments), or within any section that may be experiencing discomfort. Long enough is the time for handling the lancet, as you have been waiting at this place to try it out.
If all points made with the caustic on this entire limb are healed and carefully placed within those areas that have been cured, pay close attention to these locations for proper recovery.

Given that this is a medieval medical text with terminology influenced by Latin but also
The provided line in the ancient hemorrhage treatment seems to be referring to an old method of cauterization used for treating bleeding within
When apoplexy (an ancient term for what we might now refer to as a hemorrhagic stroke or severe internal bleeding) is old-fthy and the remedy that you have at hand does not involve fever treatment, then do so with four cauterizations: over all parts of your head; in addition, perform them on the area around the temples where we mentioned it before. Also apply these treatments to areas associated with heat (as if there were a fever present), which could include localized swelling or inflammation that mimics febrile conditions without actual high temperature – perhaps relating to infection control rather than treating an authentic fever as might have been understood back then. The translation of each line from Latin-influenced medieval language into English is as follows:
And it has been cauterized on the stomach'dictum, and may be worse now; apply therein the water that proceeds from you to heal it.

Apply pressure to the head of the malady and place your hand over it using an instrument as described in this treatise: "Pressure applied atop illness's head with hands or device" which translates into direct English, “Administer topical compresses for ailment’s summit following instructions from herein.” This suggests the use of specific techniques and tools outlined within these medical texts to apply

Thus if for those who are sick; otherwise (if not), there will be three caustic treatments applied on the lower parts of their head, which originate from within and extend up to near the nape: "Therefore it is so with patients suffering" or in English as “In such cases,” without exception, practitioners shall perform a triple cauterization (burning) at various sections below one's skull; these treatments are internal sources reaching out towards their neck. This sentence describes an alternative treatment protocol for individuals who do not fall into the previously mentioned category of needing caustic intervention on specific head regions, detailing a methodology that is And there is space between each of these instruments for cautioning water that comes forth.
May you also apply and the humidity is tolerable at this time of year; if your application becomes greater, then perform cautery on both toes.
Apply such care that it is healed; and if cauteries are given, do so according to the manner in which they have been presented by them (the doctor).

The provided text in Latin phrases appears to be a medieval approach toward understanding and treating certain conditions, presumably within the context of humoral medicine—a system where health was thought to depend on maintaining balance among four bodily fluids (humors): blood,
The line translates into English as: "And so cover the brain of him at communion with us, and for the other care we have decreed in division when phlegm is great and excesses are taken out from medicine." This statement seems to reflect medieval medical thinking where balance among bodily humors was essential. Covering one's head (metaphorically or literally) during religious ceremonies might be seen as a way of aligning the body with spiritual purity, which in turn could influence health according to their belief system about maintaining 'humoral equilibrium.' The second part mentions taking care by removing excesses from
The translation of the line into English would be: "And if it is an individual who does not suffer from medicine, administer olive oil and vinegar to those serving as head covering on certain days for benefit's sake (or improvement), relating this practice with food." This suggests a treatment approach where specific substances like olives and wine are used in tandem—likely taken internally or applied topically when someone wears their 'head coverer.' The use of olive oil ("guarguarmes") combined with vinegar may have been intended to balance the hum
Translated into English: "Apply pressure to the phlegm on the head; and if there is a need for caustic (to treat), apply it precisely at the forehead where applied before, as well as in any crown of the skull being cauterized." Here, applying physical manipulation such as pressing might be seen as an attempt to expel phlegm—a humor thought excessive and harmful. The caustic would then target specific areas on or around the head believed affected by this imbalance in humors (blood). This aligns with historical practices where balancing bodily fluids was key, though modern medical understanding of ailments like ep If the humors are strong and enduring, then you will perform these burns (cauterize) on them where there is numbness and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the back and those of the chest.
Whenever it is necessary for a second lancet (olive), as previously mentioned.
If the ailment is in the patient'thy thighs (malaute), then apply delicate cautions under these guidelines.

From Latin, "caucerize" refers to the process of burning or causing a wound with heat as a treatment method.
When the causes of melancholy are rotten and moisture heavy (indicating an environment conducive to wet, decaying conditions that may affect health), it is then necessary for us to apply cautery here at this place where we treat paralysis. This suggests a treatment method involving heat or burning with the aim of curing symptoms associated with melancholy and possibly relieving physical incapacitation like paralysis, perhaps indicating an old belief that such pains could be linked together (joint pain from "rotten humors
If the cause of melancholy is excess and decays (implying that too much moist or decaying conditions exacerbate sadness), then apply heat to cleanse the mind according to what was applied before division, which might indicate a holistic approach combining physical treatment with mental cleansing. This could mean using warmth as an external therapy believed not only for its immediate application on affected areas but also for promoting internal balance and clarity of thought. Here again we see this medieval medical practice where the belief is that melancholy, often associated in historical texts with excesses (like too much moisture or humid conditions
Then take care of the head where melancholy resides (likely referring to treating symptoms associated with mental or emotional distress), place your hand over it atop its circle (symbolic gesture potentially meaning protection and containment, as 'circle' could denote a boundary around something significant such as one’s mind/emotions), and apply warmth thereon where the sun shines upon the head – indicating perhaps that gentle exposure to heat or

When ancient tears are excessively absorbed through veins and arteries where the head is balding (this suggests an issue with circulation or possible lack of nutrition), it's observed that there could be a need for cauterization, as previously mentioned in our discussion on water-cleansed hair treatments within the scalp.

When the helper's head (which may refer to medical staff or possibly an instrument) is dislocated due to lubricating humors and it does not return on its own during recovery time as expected, small movements might further dislocate; hence after reducing the dislocation initially done for you by a primary caregiver—actions we've witnessed ourselves —the helper should be repositioning over your upper or lower body parts that are above those of yours (i.dict to indicate proper alignment and support), elevating headrests accordingly if needed, especially when misalignment is in the cervical spine sections which may now need adjustments due to dislocation issues related to neck position as discussed by caregiver on your right side; this involves delicately moving or realigning their hand.

Some measures are adjusted according to this count, and therefore these are the number of cauterizations used. (Here "alcunas veguadas" can be understood as some therape extraditions or procedures; 'ajustat segon' suggests a methodical approach
Then rest over the caustic wounds to allow for healing and securement of the humors within their course; thus preventing any further dislodgment or displacement until comfort is restored. (Here "adherir le malaute a trenquilitat" can be understood as securing the flow of bodily fluids, while 'no sia maugut per alcun temps entro que sia confortat' suggests that no further movement will occur so long as relief or comfort is provided to ensure proper healing.)
If the dislocation occurs below (referring to a location perhaps not specified in this sentence but possibly underneath certain body parts mentioned elsewhere or generally understood by context) and sealing is applied, then over the muscle with a pin cauterization or point-based caustic application; thus confirming joint stability and eliminating fluid accumulation while sanitizing humors.

In the practice of treating sores or burns according to this tradition, you must grasp a dry philosophical thread (literally "thread") that has been found and take hold of it with your fingers made from thick leather. The phrase suggests an old remedy where one would use philosophy—a conceptual rather than physical tool in modern medicine—as part of the treatment process for sores or burns, which could symbolize using knowledge as a healing agent within this traditional context.

When pain occurs in the joint of thigh and it is caused by excessive fluid (or putrefied pills) or man-made/artificial ones, use this water that we have to not agitate these humors' accumulation; therein apply a cauterization.
The manipulation of the cautery in that second use is either as a medicine-burning instrument or a focus (source), meaning it can be used for therape extrinsic heating purposes when burned by medicinal substances and also function like an incandescent object.
Here come two scientific methods, one of which involves performing three circumcision cuts according to this shape and goes deep into the good depth; do these things for those aspects.

May these medical instruments (lancets) be held firmly here for those who are suffering, and deprive them of their place with the handle that has been pierced through in this instrument; it is as if its length corresponds to two nuts or bolts likewise found within. In medieval medicine context, a lancet was likely used during procedures such as cauterization (burning) for various reasons including pain relief and wound healing control by removing blood flow from the area temporarily before applying heat with hot irons ("porta de ferr"). The length of time in contact or pressure applied would metaphorically be compared to two nuts holding it firmly, indicating a careful balance between effectiveness (cauterization)

The metaphorical use suggests an understanding that gradual pressure, like repeated small turns ("small increments") of the 'water wheel,' may offer soothing effects similar to a bee's sting—a method possibly used for pain management in medieval times before modern medicine developed more advanced treatments and understandings.
When you lift your hand with the tool and wipe away all of its moisture, it refers to using a cloth or similar material to dry off any wetness on both hands while holding medical instruments during treatment in this context:

From the context of this medieval medical treatise, "Cauda" appears to be a Latin term related to treatment methods or procedures for specific conditions like gout and joint pain. The given translation
When joint pain (dolor de juncturas) is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body and occurs particularly in the feet, it's a typical practice for doctors to call this gout (podagra). In English: Whenever there is inflammation at the joints due to invading cold substances throughout our bodies, resulting especially in foot pain as per tradition among physicians.
And when gout of humoral excess is healed without recurrence of pain, then the cautions are not needed anymore for relief.
When you are performing that specific cleansing action in the circulation of the joint between the foot and the leg, it's about proper application with your caulters (cauterization tools).
It is then this very oil of which it is said that here lies its form:
If it is necessary for points to be made on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed instrument (cautery). If pains penetrate into the chest or other joints, and movement causes them pain, then it is necessary to perform cautery on any one of those spots with three or four lancets for this purpose throughout that part which already has been subjected to cauterization.
If it is necessary to use these caulters (cautery tools), then apply them as needed without pressing your hand too much on the wound previously treated with them; this should only be done if you need to send someone else for a cauterization of the navel.
If pain enters into both hips and shoulders, then administer the treatment that we have mentioned in our chapter.
If the pain is only in the hips and waist alone, then it's called sourness; when this discomfort comes rolling through as if passing through flames, prick on those two lines.
If there remain pains in the joints, then make points on the circumference of each knot over every part and upon the palm.
If pain occurs in the hips or muscles on certain days, then they will burn all parts of their assistants with caustic substances.
And if the large intestine is not discharged properly by good diet and medicine reception, provided there is a beneficial effect from this treatment with these instruments, God helps as well.

There are some wanders for cauterization with considerable force if the species of leprosy is caused by decay and melancholy humors infiltrating each part of the body, while gentle treatment should be used minimally when dealing with such cases as dictated by medical practice at that time.
And when you intend to cauterize that part, consider if the leprosy is present and has not spread here or there from what we have divided in this section above, nor on the body as a whole; for then it is necessary to perform cauterization: once at the head of the chest with one type of caustic, twice (or more) downwards along the back near where hair begins among people's bodies, and both over two bunions—once behind upon the nape or servant; and these precautions are taken to prevent spread within the body.

This sentence indicates procedures used by medics during wartime when soldiers sustained injuries.

It emphasizes stopping the bleeding by applying heat ("cauterization") to a specific location where excessive flow is observed and preventing further loss of blood from that site, highlighting one technique used in medieval times for managing wounds before modern medical practices were developed.

When large droopiness comes to the eyelids of humans, it indicates potential medical concerns such as ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid). Here's an interpretation
Whenever there is persistent sagging in the patient's upper eyelids for any reason that builds up strength and toughness within its structure, it leads to a significant increase (or "grandissa") of this condition; hence, medical intervention ("apelada") may be necessary. This statement suggests an observation about ptosis possibly progressing due to increased laxity or structural issues in the eyelid muscles and connective tissue that require professional

The method of operation is to take a doubled needle and fix it on the body part (the affected area), then make holes in both sides of this place: one hole between your right tear gland, another through your left; thus that thread passes from side A to B across these orifices. This procedure suggests an early form of surgery involving suturing with a needle and threads possibly for correcting issues related to tears (lacrimation). The technical details indicate the rudimentary nature of medical practices at this time, where direct access was required through making incisions near sensitive areas like tear glands. It demonstrates an understanding that certain operations might require targeted approaches within specific regions and a degree of surgical skill to perform such tasks with limited tools as described by medieval practitioners.

When in the nose are nascent meats of various kinds that have no cause for being assembled into scorpions or polyps, which this disease is called pemphit due to its resemblance to those creatures represented by such tentacles from our throat downward. (Translation: When nasal growths in the form of different meats appear without reason and take shapes similar to scorpions or polypous masses within the nose, this condition is referred to as pemphy due to its similarity with these lower body structures.) Regarding the blackened flesh and how it is colored in our nose here we are concerned with—the darkening of tissue within which typically should not be such a hue, whereas this particular necrosis does retain its natural yellowish-red tone from above us down to below. (Translation: We examine when the blackened flesh appears inside your nose
Thus in these blackened flesh there is neither cancer nor a wolfish growth; perform the procedure of removing phlegm between your thighs and place it outside under sunlight, taking turns with breathing into them until warmth returns to those areas within—this method helps restore heat. (Translation: In cases where these blackened flesh are not malignant or indicative of a wolfish growth like cancerous tissue might be, one should clear phlegm trapped between the legs and place it outside in sunlight while taking deep breaths alternately to warm up that area once again.) Here comes the first source sentence to translate: May you hold the scabbard or encounter an incision made for drainage; if it is from malignant apstomata, then rest and apply a hot comedo to that which has detached itself and all cavities are exposed.

May it happen that the jawbone or other bones in the mouth break, or if you experience pain there, then treat it where necessary with what is convenient for these instruments and forceps we use when extracting teeth. The way to do this will be as follows:

Hence, these are the teeth held firmly within bone rather than restorative fillings made of gold or silver (since "argent" signifies both precious metals and could imply a filling material). Gold does not tarnish over time; however, other types may require replacement after certain periods—be it days for temporary fixes as mentioned ("alscus dias"), weeks perhaps. Silver fillings can corrode or wear away with use since they do so naturally without the need of specific intervals to replace them like gold does not generally deteriorate quickly unless subjected to harsh conditions, which are usually avoided in dentistry for these materials due to their biocompatibility and durability when properly implemented.

If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the hollow of the snake (presumably referring to an abscess or infection), place your pause within the indentation of the canula with a heated iron rod, apply as much heat as necessary while ensuring that the pus is dead and has been removed from the cavity; thereby preventing it from draining throughout the day.

Here are the translations for each line of the medieval medical treatise:
The second sign is that it occurs in the places where pains are felt within the body, and such pain at the head is different from pain at the navel—both being separate types of inflammation; each one requires surgical intervention for treatment.
When some points are made that have not been fully developed in the diseases of those persons, or at their completion, here come these to be addressed:
So other implants that are dislocated when crossed and do not mature according to their complement, like those present at joints, become a cause of contraction in that limb; or an internal perforation if delayed within the main organ has reached its ripening stage therein - delaying may worsen it. Or if it is about the navel and this one does not mature yet here too: pierce immediately so as not to disrupt digestion, but that which concerns the belly button area; once perforated, extends into the segments of the abdomen causing fistula or causes pain in its location until cured. May you know when the puncture of the abscess is due, and so it will be ripe for intervention.
E understand that it matures when the pain gives way and fever subsides; reduce speechlessness and heartbeat, strengthen the head of abscesses, and improve other sensations.
When you know where the incision for draining is needed, immediately at that location affected by abscess and purulent discharge from treatment of swelling.
Perforation occurs above the flesh or body parts, if pricks are in muscle areas and limbs' joints, nerves, ligaments, or locations where there is no reflection; use perforation according to that part which reflects it back.
When the abscess is in the flesh, then we must introduce a lance into it until confirmed digestion of its contents has occurred; but if you pierce that area now, it will extend the patient'thy leg and feet joints, making them hardened and deepening their cavities.
May one prick with a sharp instrument according to the flesh'dictates or as required by which part of the body needs it most urgently.
When you administer a small incision, and large deep incisions or broad sections according to the variety of the apendices' greatness.
And among the points where the colon is perforated and inflamed, when pain occurs with bread intake or during feverish episodes, similar to that which you have caused by introducing cold drafts into their body (inferred from "trops of dubelec" meaning colic spasms/buboes).
Of those who are seated and have three angles; they sit similarly to the figure of a fir tree branch or like the legs/pillars of an arch.
From those parts where a round and crescent-shaped medicine is administered, they seem like them (the patients).
May those who cannot bear surface lancets be spared their puncture; the one you penetrate with a shallow depth only so much.
And when the abscess is large and has collected disease matter, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; take out some from that portion today, treat the remaining infection tomorrow with larger quantities as necessary until fully resolved through gradual drainage into an appropriate opening.
E primarily if the malady is due to excessive yellow bile or female prenatal phase, or a young child, or elderly weakness; for their spirits are driven out causing illness release from within and they pass away quickly afterward—at this point you perform the operation.
Guard with great caution and apply your puncture in the hole where you pierce these thorns; be sure to keep away any plagues, then consider whether the pus from the thorn is scant or flat - administer those remedies that were used by old healers for it. If however, the thorn wound is large and there are fissures in your puncture site – stop blood at each point where we meet within these walls.
If in the abscess it has detached a part of the colon or if that area is concave within the circuit, then cover it with thick wool cloth or linen as you carry out your pans and rags; keep its moisture for three days inside; and process those materials to cure what comes from the bandages once they are used.
If you feel a flow of phlegm during your operation, then administer cold water and wring them out in cloths which are placed on the location where the mucus movements have been maintained for some time.
If the flow of blood persists, then when you administer your regimen and care with these powders recommended in this book'dictum, it will be beneficial.
If it is winter time and the site of ulceration is a place where nerves are located, then cover them with dust and oil to stop bleeding therein; apply pressure over these areas.
If it is summer and the places are carnal (fleshy), then when you rest your pills at the beginning of the day in water and oil, as we have said before, this allows all humors to leave that belong inside him until a healthy day comes, and whereupon, when you draw out the abscess and wash it away with what has been applied for its cure within him.
So it is that knowledge of the cure universally becomes necessary, perhaps according to this method I have already described for each specific ailment on how to treat such an illness individually.

When recalling time from memory as instructed (note that "rememoracio" is not standard Latin and seems like an attempt at archaic or regional Italian, which could make this translation more speculative
It appears you've provided a phrase followed by the Roman numeral LI, but
The text seems to be in or related to medical Latin terminology regarding an issue with "the navel" (umbilicus).
The eminence of the navel is painful due to causes such as fissures in the umbilical region that are on the abdomen; or it may be because there's a tear according to what has been mentioned here, which could involve blood vessels (vena) and arteries. It might also result from constricted circulation within this area, as suggested by 'ventositat coarctata.'
May it be through the crack of the cisternal and tearing of the membrane, the appearance of the suppuration is like that of the body; and its pain resembles that of a lion in various situations. If it is an exit from the hernia (budel), then you have noted what we've counted upon together with great intensity difference; when you perceive this amount as hidden, return to its position and elevate rapidly - hence, immerse him in a bath quickly accompanied by vigorous exercise.
If it is due to moisture, then you are like a lion; neither hidden when close beside your hand nor constrained or compressed.
If it is about sanctus (pertaining or holy), then here come these black signs appearing on the sacrum bones.
May it be due to flesh nothing serious, severe and hard; then follows a certain quantity.
May it be due to wind movement, then touching of him is like a lion.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the prominency of the navel is due to either the intestine or the sling, then order that it swells its own (presumably refers to inflammation), and remain extended; and on your command, seize control over all parts within the abdomen circuit around the location where you have pressed upon with a finger. Also assign commands for those between your limbs above this point of pressure, surrounding them as far outwardly in the belly region under which they are placed (referring to monitoring these areas), and encompassing that same spot within the sling circuit around it; extend control over parts away from you using strength or submission. Also assign commands for those beyond your hands at this point of pressure, surrounding them as far outward in both directions above where you have pressed upon with a finger (indicating containment and possibly treatment). Extend these actions to the extremities affected by prolapse; encompass within their respective circuits around what has fallen through using strength or submission.
Here comes the translation for each line:
If you have torn the fabric (of flesh), then take that one out now; and cut off all excess from it.
If it is contrary to your artery or vein thereabouts, encircle that area and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those fields of strength you have pierced through which caused the abscess in its entrance at finger joint (a type of wound), allowing contents to penetrate – hold this abscess firmly with four parts spread over these inserted needles.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where it pierces the extended flesh, inserting one when subtlety is reached and pulled out gently; take care that what comes forth from within those wrapped in cloth for its cure shall be gathered up.
If the navel of the patient is made entirely or partly from fleshlessness (lacking substance), then you must treat it with water and diuretics to remove wetness, which in that case resides therein; also care for such fluid accumulation, ensuring its removal.
The text provided seems like an attempt at translating Old Occitan or early Romance

May when it is old and severe, you cannot treat the patient here, for they have not responded to any treatment thus far nor has anyone else arrived yet.
When the operation in it is that you allocate ashes with water having been previously prepared and cleanse some of this black bile accumulation if there is an abnormally swolthy (repletion) manifestation present, then:
And prepare the limb in which it is placed for operation, and fasten with screws on each incision made to secure them there; ensure that they are concave throughout so as not to damage any of its causes internally. Here the treatment begins; do not remove that limpness, and express the locations, and cleanse it with your hand or any tool at which you are able.
If you find contrary thickness of the vein or artery, then cauterize that within whereby the flow of blood is stopped, and take care so that this other remedy may be applied while it heals inside thereafter.

When you have already treated this herbal tympanist in medicine and it does not discomfalcate your treatment, consider that if relief has been achieved at the malady or body part mentioned (now/in those areas), be wary of another ailment likewise needing such remedy, as concern for you when dealing with all these issues.
Might you again raise the swolthy abdomen of your patient and use this method to express its belly according to these instructions: Raise the distended abdomen of the patient (possibly due to excessive vitality), which is not another illness but merely waterlogging, neither a child nor an old person. The manifestation of his/her condition requires you to lift up their swollen abdomen with your hands and use this method expressing its belly by placing cushions under them; pour the water into the area just after ejaculation, then apply crushed sponge as per these guidelines.
Sometimes there are two sharp parts on the extremity with a splint; however, it may have some small lengths at times during the operation to ensure that none enters into the hernia and you can handle it safely.

When the instrument is placed outside of its vessel (the body), and when it enters the water, that same momentarily rests on the instrument; thus, evacuates the fluid from within in such quantity as to be at odds with this hour if not completely removed – then you risk damaging your humoral fluids due to their expulsion through resolution.

The sentence provided seems to be a mix of Latin and possibly regional medical terminology, which could refer to the condition where there is an accumulation or decay within the foreskin at its base near the head (vergutum) with associated corrosion ("corropio") and blackening due to retained dirt/materials leading to adherence. Translating this line into English while attempting to maintain some of the archaic feel
This translation interprets your sentence as follows: "These retained materials within the foreskin are in this area of thickened skin (eminentia cutis)." Here, I've translated medical conditions and observations into a more understandable English while trying to retain some older style language
The provided line distinguishes between two types of material retained in the foreskin: one that is potentially cancerous ("es maligna") and another that isn't harmful ("no-m
This line seems complex and could be interpreted as follows in modern English: "The non-malignant material can you subtly remove one by hand while completely removing the other; afterwards apply an Egyptian liniment over that spot where it will heal with ointment." Here, I have clarified medical actions described using older language into a coherent set of instructions in English. The translation includes:
If the abdomen is of dark and evil hue, then when you administer cautery to it, apply also to its navel and region (belly).
May it be that the foreskin is on the head of the penis and another part has been cut off (circumcision), one portion being detached during your care within which healing occurs; and furthermore, in taking care of this incision, ensure not to allow it from tearing when you are caring for the prepuce.
And when you examine the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption have occurred; therefore cover all that has already become degenerated or is about to decay, apply liniments on this area made of freshly ground flour from rye bread and berries crushed and pounded.
Return that for its own healing, it will be taken care of by something else within itself at this time.
May it be necessary for a flow of blood (sanguine), then apply moonlight cauterization according to this manner.
Quar calorific jewels are two means of treatment; they serve as the flow of sanctity and filth when corrupted.
If the head of the gallbladdigon is corroded and destroyed in an instant, then you insert a bronze tube into the flesh of the foreskin to allow the bile to flow through it.
In the attachment of the prepuci at the base of the foreskin (and this adherence is not cut off but in which it attaches, and there's no circumcision required; when an adhesion occurs due to dirt or infestation), peel away that hard spot within where the prepuce has become attached, dissolving its ligament completely and detaching the foreskin head entirely.
If it is difficult to reach those exquisitely, then cover that which may cause pain at the head of the vertebra and penis; thus when subtle, forcefully pierce through due to its delicacy with a lancet.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E apporto separato tra i prepuzio e il capo della verga amdra, che già è immerso nell'acqua fetida in modo tale da non attaccare altre guarigioni.

Translated line by line into English:
So it is said that ancient ones did not perform circumcision among free men, as they do not use them for their laws and only acquire such practice through experimentation. This causes the loss of a large part of craftsmen and barbers who traditionally used circumcision and mundification with new razors and straight razors; in addition to using thread from hides or leather, as well as shaving implements like scissors for beard trimming.
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better clarification with the knife or thread in unguent (ointment), where bubbles escape from below the waist, from under the testicles of two tunics, and rise up through tight clothing quickly, leaving you at greater risk for other injuries.

Whenever that joy is something you can perceive with your intelligence, it arrives throughout the entirety of this possibility within yourself.

Therefore take care of that water which congeals from the dust particles, recommended in the passage about these dust particles.
If it has been inserted into the throat in proper measure, and you obey its divisions below, then he/she will not notice it there (meaning that if an instrument or remedy is properly introduced through the neck and followed as directed for lower parts of the body, no discomfort or awareness should be felt by the patient).

The phrase in Latin, which translates from Italian and relates to bladder discharge (presumably of a medical nature), can be translated into English as follows:
The translation into English breaks down each element as follows:
If there is no dissolution of the fluid we have mentioned as vehemently causing pain on the waist, then it's necessary to remove this cause with an instrument you call a syringe (which has fine silver and subtle lion composition), similar in delicacy to a needle used for catheterization. This tool is shaped like half of a palm and thumb combined into one form; its tip, which rests at the top of it, being extremely slender – much like the head of an acupuncture needle or syringe cannula with slight flexibility along its length.
E the urine examination by that person who grips and holds tightly outside of it in wool or cloth for good measure; and inserting the ends of the thread into the region near the urethra, you cut with scissors if there is any excess cause from the wool, may insert into the catheter immediately at once through force.
When applying pressure on the thigh, secure the bladder and vein with a ligature made of wool or silk threaded through an eyelet, using oil and wine as lubricants.

When acute bladder ulceration or appendicitis occurs, or when the peritoneum becomes inflamed and restricted by a puncture wound (presumably from an injury), it is necessary to drain fluids and medicines into that area. The appropriate instrument for this purpose—the clyster syringe (or enema irrigation device) referred to here as "clampcedra" in the context of medieval medical practices, should be used:

Adjust your hand over the bladder because that moisture which has entered through what is referred to as "centa" (likely an old or regional term for urethra) and caused fluid accumulation within, should be positioned so it does not protrude excessively. This suggests a treatment approach aiming at managing the patient's swollen bladder condition by manual support through direct contact with their body area in question (probably due to urinary distress or ret

Capitolo LXII – This is likely indicating a chapter number in an ancient
Section on hernia outcry (or perhaps 'herniation'). The phrase suggests the topic being discussed
A hernia is simply an accumulation of moisture within the white crib (or possibly a reference to fluid surrounding organs or in body cavities), and it's called 'crypt'. The term "crib" might refer loosely to where internal structures, such as intestines, are located. In this context, ancient medical terminology likely uses metapthy ('ciphac') rather than anatomical terms understood today; hence the explanation of a hernia in these
At times it is within the panniculus (fatty tissue layer) where nature happens in its course for urine production, between the white cribs which we mentioned beforehand; and this 'tart' or fibrous band isn’t actually part of that process. The text here implies a separation from normal physiological processes into what is considered an abnormal condition (likely referring to conditions such as hernias where tissues protrude). Here, the author points out something distinct – not inherently linked with urine production within this 'panniculus' layer and clarifies that it does not belong ('aquo') in its usual location. The language used is dense with

If during the procedure of that wound on your cranium at the time of your operation, once you have completed the stitching of the sciatic nerve, return and adjust those lips (lips) of the uterus's cervix sewn together by its suture, taking care to do so as with other laborers.
If you have corrupted the humors through another illness, then it is necessary that you remove what causes pain in their vessels and extract the humor therein; apply care to this very thing which we discussed earlier.
May if water is added to any of these parts, you will understand that the joints are hernias; therefore inspect this part where you have already operated on another limb; and if it'suposedtobe an operation, perform it here as well.
Return the snake to its cavity, and insert it into water or oil in which you have submerged other wool (or linen), then expand that piece of material over two thighs and belly pieces; afterward pause under folded sheets and powdered lint, spreading these items as follows:

Furthermore, two more belts are placed over each knee joint and two others on both shoulder blades; all is neatly adjusted within the breeches' waistband.
And in some cases this hernia is treated artificially with caulters placed here for incision and drainage; you grasp a thin lancet that have been inserted into the navel of your intestines, where there has emerged white phlegm containing water.

Because you understand that this operation is a safeguard and prevents the flow of blood towards extremity lengthening operations, which are better than an incision (cut or opening).
If you create counteraction with caution during the time of separation or while doing cauterization, and if what happens to your body is causing discomfort for which treatment I recommend at this moment—then take care accordingly.
May the abdomen be frightened and not expect a second operation due to its horror, do so when you have done it as I recommend; and once certified that we've discussed the meanings, understand that this hernia is expandable.

May it be the sea's displeasure at that time when you pierce through it: and this is not water but clear panniculus in its womb, causing hostility towards healing from within, whereupon if you place pain or an instrument used for extraction into it, then remove the water from the drops (likely meaning blood), shaped by that very tool. Adjust a small item to the state of things therein.

From "the care of an intestinal hernia." The text seems to describe steps taken by medical professionals in
The arrival of this hernia occurs because the intestines have been extended over the abdomen due to weakness in the muscles of the belly wall; when those breaches happen, parts protrude from them. This passage explains how a loss of integrity or strength in the body's internal structures can lead to physical manifestations such as hernias and suggests that treating these underlying causes is essential for medical intervention ("the care"). It points out that physicians focus on realigning what has been displaced within, possibly using manual techniques.
This rupture is either of the cistern or due to excretion from it, and you cause these pains through various means: by concussion, bleeding, moaning, elevation of any severe underlying cause, or pretending.
When the humidity of water increases due to extension (strain or overuse), it causes mild pain for long periods without severe attacks and leads to softening inside, whereby the intestine enters through a small opening in the belly into the cavity held by your hand.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it happens on the fifth section of the spinal cord during commensalment, there occurs vehement pain that seems various in appearance; this is due to distension of the intestine and issues from its cavity affecting different parts of the body below the mentioned vertebra.

The sentence in English would be: "Regarding the milking of the scrotum in bachelors is softened for thus much time as between those pieces are moistened; and it requires careful observation." Here, a medieval medical perspective on treating male genital health issues such as possibly swelling or inflammation within the scrotal area (codena dels testiculs) is described. The practice likely involves softening tissues through some form of application – perhaps moistened cloths or poultices
The sentence in English would be: "Therefore it is necessary for him who cares about the treatment of such matters that are infected, and to envelop all around the scrotum which has been softened over its natural state; also adjust both lips as part of a suture." Herein, this directive suggests maintaining hygiene in cases where there may be an infection (jazer le malaute) affecting parts near or involving the male genitalia. The instruction likely relates to dressings and possibly surgical care ("and adjust both lips as part of a suture"), indicating attention should also extend beyond mere softening, suggesting intervention for potential injury repair in an era when medical knowledge was limited but precise
The sentence translates to English as: "If you wish, in the case of excess moisture on the softened scrotum after three or four cookings (or heating sessions), firmly apply a suture." This implies an ancient practice where heat was used potentially for therapeutic reasons. In this context, it seems that if there is too much fluid build-up due to

Regarding hernias in men are two ways: one is when it appears as if there's a woman inside the space between the scrotum and where her hair would be, that's called an inguinal hernia." This medieval medical text describes different types of hernias found in males. It mentions two main categories for such conditions—one involving what seems to resemble a female figure within certain body spaces related to sexual organs (inguinal), and the other simply referred as appearing between scrotum, which would likely detail another form or type specific to that location without using contemporary anatomical terminology. Here is a line by line translation:

This medieval medical text describes certain conditions or observations found in females which metaphorically relate back to what would be seen within males. It speaks about 'two testicles' having some quantity of seed (semen), with an emphasis on its location relative both at the base and above, drawing parallels between female body functions described herein and those occurring in men — a reflection typical for medieval medical literature where comparisons were drawn from animal or even mythical references to understand human bodies.

The text provided appears to be instructions or observations from an old medical treatise written in a mix
It seems the text is attempting to convey something about midwives (matrones) instructing on how unborn children (enbianus bius) should be treated during childbirth as their second figure, or natural process in Italian dialects mixing elements of Latin and vernac alluded. However, there are spelling errors which make it difficult
The text appears to discuss the role of a midwife (matrona) with respect to childbirth as described in Italian dialects that blend Latin influences: The necessity for which arises because she must understand natural birth figures, and when it is time for her to express parts during labor. When fresh air becomes necessary - essentially whenever the baby's position overtakes or descends within (“es sobre ella es del part”), immediate action should be taken in that moment; this urgency reflects a childbirth as its second, natural occurrence ("segon figura natural"). Herein lies her role: to attend at head level and ensure the baby’s safety - specifically referring either suspended or dangling from (“ombelic”) an umbilical cord.
So when you press those thighs, the belly of him should be compressed so that his embryo will not expel itself as soon as they lie on their head; at this time give them a second treatment and remove all superfluous humors with good purification.
May those parts that are not natural and not lusible become ill when they grow within oneself in the feet or belly; if these organs come out before one's head (belly), another part may also be involved, either above your head on your chest/breast, below your head on your stomach, causing a strong pull towards your colon. These parts resemble unnatural forms and cannot return to their proper place by themselves.
When necessary, it is for the midwife who is wise and subtle in all these matters, to watch out for errors and deceit.
And when you present their entire figure in those ways, it is meant for them and stands upon the waters (i.dict).

Precede pushing the woman's belly inside until she delivers the baby.
If not done so already, then cover the woman with mucilage of millet and fennel ashes to prevent her from being stone-struck (a term likely referring to a form of hardening or calcification within the body).
E command the patient to compress and apply that poultice nowhere in particular until they feel better at some point thereafter; place your mouth and nose on it thenfor as long a time as needed when you see improvement through their openings (mouth, nostrthy).
If the larger parts of the belly are discharged through the opening (perforation), then it is necessary to slowly reduce those same ones back into place gradually. If she does not obey the treatment inside her body, then lift the woman'dict over a table and raise their legs upward, placing the board on the ground below them; thus ensuring that the woman will maintain balance during contraction (concussion).
If the masses are not torn apart and remain in the belly or on their chest, then carefully extract them from there with your hand covered by a cloth (sheet), taking out what is necessary to restore balance; that person will recover healthily.

If there is no water that we have recommended to take in, then return the little body gradually within as long as you maintain that second figure of nature; and by doing so, healing will come naturally (or occur). Here's a line-byse translation:
If it is prohibited to remove all the fluid that we have relocated (implying treatment of excess fluids in the body), then take muscle from above and dissolved gum for cautery, and beat them thoroughly in the mortar for good percussion, apply lines on the woman'dicts urine (blood) layer beneath her skin, which is also known as uremic crystals. When you apply that heat over there (to patient's body), so as to achieve relief of indigestion.
When parts of it are made smooth and softened by mint and pressure is applied to that area for them: When you submerse them in a fumigation bath for an hour, then lay down on the board (probably some form of wooden plank), and spread that poultice over their mouth, taking it off afterward, and press with your hand at the lower part of their abdomen under compression as if pressed by god.
Eye examination is traditionally performed by one of them. It is brought into reduction of its mass (of the body), if you cannot reduce it yourself; otherwise raise the woman and carry her to that place.
If not possible to proceed further, lay the patient on their back and press down firmly upon their hips with vigorous blows; administer bandages made of pus as recommended for treatment.
If childbirth has occurred, then make that cauterization over the cesium (cervix), and focus on reducing swelling of the body; form second natural shape of the fetus inside her, making it contract and commanding it to return into itself so that there is a proper exit.
Ease of the belly expanded and its facade is at two from her mother'dictively translates to, "Relief in the abdomen with enlarged area and on its face located approximately two away from her maternal lineage." (Please note: this translation assumes some liberties due to potential language evolution or errors Here the mother holds her hand on the belly and turns that small one over by it piece by piece, making things easier: This suggests in English-speaking contexts as follows - The mother gently rests her hands upon the pregnant woman's abdomen (belly) bit by bit to provide comfort or assist with positioning.
When they have enough of it (possibly referring to a substance), and the time comes when they apply oil and mucilage from it, here translates as: "Once there is sufficient quantity at hand, that's when one applies oils and gums taken from this source."

Further, ensure with these instructions everything is mixed properly: This can translate into English-speaking contexts like - Direct the person to apply it bit by bit when needed and place some on a small dish or plate while seated comfortably at their side table. Make sure all ingredients are well combined before use for effective treatment as per these instructions. Exit fetus prepared above the abdomen translates to: This phrase suggests in English-speaking contexts that a pregnant woman has an

Exit of twins or fetuses. You understand that twins are often moved today, and some may come three or four times a day, which can be strange and unnatural; perhaps due to natural causes, but they do not live naturally as before.
Where those are multiplied and accompanied by a secondary figure, they stand apart for their respective purposes; separately these attendants guide the intestines through the belly button of each individual some times during natural laxatives administration when used together with drinks to promote evacuation.
If it is difficult for them to bear their burdens and they come upon us with complaints about unnatural figures, then take care of these children as we have described.

If you have already fixed the spondylolisthesia in the lumbar or completely, and thus saved the veins of the colon, then adjust your lips on the sacrum with suture without touching that area; from it as much as possible restore them to their natural shape, tighten them for proper structure alignment, leave them under cloth dressings for several days until healing occurs. Adjust care accordingly when there is stiffness and excitement within so they can recover fully.
May if the child already experiences pain in their bones, then you will strike that area; and if there are fragments of bone within them, remove all those which you can from them; but if it is not possible to do so at home, let water enter where the child has been bitten, allowing pus formation for separation and extrusion.

If the ointment is not at your disposal, then rest in the water of the pig cottage so that you drink the fluid that comes from the humidities; and make the gout sleep on top of the pig to allow the body-adjusted liquid to flow.

When two of one'dict own stitches communicate with the other pains, perhaps even within their abdominal stitch itself.
Yeah recommends you each one' extricate or declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from any cause of the intestine (hernia), it's difficult to reduce that; either due to its diminutiveness or because the hernia becomes inflamed through the coldness of the air:
When the water comes in, then when you cut that which is submerged under a moist cloth alone or squirming into it while holding cayenne, pepper, and splints together for entry to where inflammation can be resolved.
When joint pain has subsided in this way where the application of water was made, it is better than letting just water resolve inflammation alone.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the water where it has swelled and become bloated; thus, gently remove its entrails with minimal cause.
If it is possible to release the intestine from this treatment, then divide the rupture into small parts using an instrument that has been previously inserted in their joints.

And when the vermin is increased and comes out of the hernia, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its own form in its proper place, if possible above water, which is better for it.
When the disruption is wide and it's in the lower part of the abdomen, where you have unzipped your patient’thy thighs and placed cushions under them, as well as servants on their legs and chest holding hands; if it is below the abdomen area:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: If disruption is in one of the bowels' parts, then immediately halt your understanding and consideration for as long until that which contains what escapes has been put back there by itself/others.
When it is necessary that you apply this (likely referring to a treatment or remedy) in the large and small ulcers,
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for it, and make the servant between your own fingers—the one holding has swelling all over its mouth (face), adjusting the lips of yours so that they fit each other properly; also bridge from there to where any stitch was applied due to a cause related or another.
Here is the line-by extralanguage translation:
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "They are small needles moving into flesh; and large ones have difficulty in penetrating bone," because they move through delicacy, making it hard for them to enter thicknesses such as within a ribcage.
And where the needle is inserted into any part of their nether regions for that flesh will not be skinned and filth will not accumulate in front of its healing,
Even so they are not sewn for a long time that flesh should not be prevented from healing.
Here comes the first source sentence: Ensure you insert your needles so that they do not pierce through the patient'thy sleep, stopping above the expanded sewing stitches throughout the entire parting; and place those there until you know that the wound has healed.
These surgical needles are placed carefully in the small wounds, just enough for their closure with a needle or thread around that area.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you bind the four limbs together from the coccyx to the upper extremities using a needle, with delicate and thickness in its thread.
When the needle is in those four extremities (hands and feet), reduce it from that piece of material cut by her surgeon'se, to make sure that the wound area will go up into the body part divided for bandaging, thus ensuring that suture align with the folded cloth there.
When there is a pause between any stitch of the said limb'matter (the thick part), it means that...
This stitch heals men.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And when the child is solidified in the spaces of fourteen days or more, and its illness has been treated, apply moisture for motion purposes to promote healing; this treatment continues over many years as part of their disposition.
Even those doctors who had not healed yet have a wand that does no good; but when it touches the spot where wax is melted and neither medicine nor remedy has been applied there for two visits, after continuous daily immersion in honey water within this object, they are cured.
May you direct two types of sewing according to what is said by Parayla.
When you begin with stitching of the navel and insert the needle from one side to another of the sides, it means:
And when the needle enters into the navel and in that body part where you previously inserted it, piercing both deep and long throughout all of this body portion, place the point where the needle entered; make it penetrate also the other extreme of what is inside my patient.
When you have felt that entrance, then make another passage in the same manner between the extreme parts of this body segment from here to there; and let the exterior cavity of the cistern be penetrated by the other extremity' extrusion - apply an entry point likewise.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When it is possible that something will enter through your entrance into where, in that place of his body which he enters and remains within you entirely as all of him pours out there—this thing may pierce or flow downward towards the area at the end (extremity) of sight where he exists.
E begins from this side of the patient's body and takes that limb, holding it at its extremity opposite to where we are looking here (on the other cheek), then pushes in there with a needle taken out by fingers/hand, which is now inserted back into that same place on the chest; also taking another from their hand.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And you give another remedy and apply it within what has been used, according to that which is left after its use as an example.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical text:
May the second special kind of suture that Gualia uses and recommends through speech is meant for you to sew up this secondary body part as it has been cut by other healers, ensuring all parts are properly joined together in accordance with nature; applying another limb' extrémity onto each extremity belonging to the patient, according to your recommendation.
Where you keep the needle at your designated end of departure from the body, and make that enter into one part in that location, then turn over the needle so it enters another pair of digits on the thighs; thus rotate the needle to allow penetration through those two pairs of digits.
Return those bubbles and let them enter the separated parts inside, into two limbs that are opposite each other in this body'dictum (Latin: dictatum refers to a written work or statement). Here is the translation line by line:
This stitching is better than ordinary sewing and it's for which we remember making this stitching.
This is the speech of Guiliel (or William in some translations), a name often associated with medieval medical
Might the dissector use two needles to rectify the seam of the abdomen so that you can insert into these at several points, and begin using an inserted needle (likely for draining or probing), entering through one puncture site according to those other sutures which were previously made along their bodies.
When a disturbance occurs in the stomach area (belly), it is harder to sew here than at other parts of the belly.
May the healing of medicine for patients be judgment of other illnesses.
When the cause occurs as soon as fresh feces enter into their sack (the bowels), and you return the intestine and hernia back to its place, making them suitable for a decent exit over that corporeal dirt.
If the air has altered the patient' extraneous humors and they become hardened, causing swelling in their fields (organs), then treat them with heavy purgatives to solidify these phlegmatic substances; take care that this condition is treated as for other diseases within which it leads.
If you do not have the medicines with you now, rest here for some time until it begins to relieve cramps and pains in those areas, as long as today, while you are learning from me, until healed; then you will not need other medical interventзу in planned treatments when plagues become simple.
If you fear that the parasites will cause injury to the main body parts, then when submerged in warm or scalding oil (such as linseed or rosehip), hold them there and pause for a while within the spaces between joints where tendons are located.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your bowels, they move away constantly, and if the prolapse (hernia) has entered into its cavity, it becomes crushed tightly by what you hold with a black sticky instrument, especially if the prolapse comes out of the hernia.
Be aware that what is of large intestine origin heals well, and what is in the small intestines also recovers effectively.
It is difficult for the hernia referred to as "gegunu" not to receive healing from human excrement contained within it; this difficulty arises due to: (1) the large number of veins present in it and its size, which are similar to those found therein, and because of (2) the subtlety of that cosmos belonging to it, as well as (3) its closeness or propinquity to the nature of nerves.
If the material you process from the soil is cloth and if so achieved quickly with your straightened hand (which reduces swolthy tumors), then return those same ones immediately to their proper place within the body as reduced by this very action of yours.
If space has been created and black or red substance (blood) is applied therein, then you should tighten that faithful part over the location where it's darkened, in order to expel phlegm from veins and arteries within the fabric of these vessels.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Remember when you have illnesses in the intestine (budel).
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it's small, it may be restored with alkaline homes (alkaline substances or remedies), for so that you can alleviate what was causing pain inside your belly through percussion of the lanze (fistula) which lies within the seventh part of the stomach and is old/ancient, having been formed due to fluid accumulation in body movement.
And now you apply the treatment to him who was not healed in his own recovery, may that subtle agent within focus and solidify that location where health has returned.
Here comes the translation: And you have already secured the location now that has come upon it due to an evil incident in your belly; and not even one such accident should occur within their arranged piles of food, nor when washing or exergy training takes place therein.
And experienced ones who when entering the hernia, are requested according to this manner: and it is that you take large cushions; and adjust the patient's lips with these big cushions, pausing a cushion from what has been taken out of their mouth over the patient'zymes’ lips. When holding onto them tightly through your teeth, they will stick in place without dissolving away.
And if there is another part needing attention after the first one, and you continue making it as necessary according to the amount of all the leavings in the body.
Reduce that and the flesh within it, and remove those attached appendages from inside the hernia so that the hernia becomes healed; do not cause harm to anyone'thy health.
And it is possible that the intestine has been pierced by something from within these external animals' bodies using a needle; and you grasp its extremity with your fingers here, detach it completely (disarticulating), wrap it up in this thread/string around which are also nails for securing them to the hollowed intestine piece itself. Then reduce that entire area of disruption within the body.
This surgical knot is not our only means of trust and hope.
May it be if the child is large and wide, mainly if in one of the small intestines, then such illness is not apparent or gross but rather subtle, and there will be no complete healing from this for all.
Of treatment for hernias and fistulas.
You understand that when all younglings and apostemes become weakened and ulcers form without healing or detachment from the limb in any part of the body universally, it is always referred to as such a fistula by us; here'dict we apply our remedy.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
It is moisture in water where they bathe (in), and the wetness dissipates within a few hours. Some moisture is moved here, and it's scant, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes, and their signs are hereunder the remedies of them in this division.
When you have thus placed your knowledge of the treatment for an abscess, which occurs due to surgical intervention on the wound area.
E understand that an abscess forms in all the body's members, and those are the ones which come to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, spinal cord, bladder, or any of these joint structures formed by composition between ma (belly) and pe (chest), as well as proximity with main limbs and their likenesses.
So then this one among these ulcers that come from the second phase of illness is due to diseases hard to cure and not receiving care; it requires work and ignorance on their part.
If there is any depth of the wound that does not reach these places mentioned herein and you hope for healing from it, and wish to understand its nature, then take a leech or iron, if the fistula follows rectly (meaning straightens out), seek help from this person.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, investigate with a subtle hammer; for metal under its own body' extrudes and bends due to curvature.
If there is a malignant ulcer present, it'dict not within your power to attempt on him/her.
And then apply the clyster through their instruments, whereby the moisture for this procedure will come from those other devices and flows downward with them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood upon all these causes and seen them clearly, then according to your confession: the following is what I consider - whether it be an apparent fistula near or far from joint connections, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of those locations which are present with you.
Here comes another sentence to translate: Then dry up (the fistula) as soon as it is directed by him/her [doctor], and remove whatever exists in that filtration which came from decayed bones, or born within the body itself—whether of flesh and semblance, and cure whatsothy's inside when healed.
May it be that the fistula is deep and secondarily healed, then cover it with what you can as much as possible in your reach; cleanse all of its corrupted parts thoroughly using tightly wrapped medicinal poultices, and insert those into the cavity of the fistula which you have understood to be forged.
When some cold humors enter for a few days into the cavity of the fistula due to decay, medicine sharply dissolves all that enters therein.
Return that which remains in wax as it produces healthy flesh within while being cured.
If not healed by this means, then do the second of those that have been recommended for cautery on it.
May it be that the cause of fistula is bone and joints, then you must certify this; inquire about that dry one as recommended by us if you do not prohibit any possible causes from veins or nerves or main body parts.
If you find that the bone is exposed and there are any decay or blackness, then treat what has become diseased in its entirety; take care of whatever substance it carries within so that everything inside may be healed.
If the patient is not healthy and sickly as he was doing before, you will understand that you have not yet reached the complete cure of corruption; hence, with great attention and refinement examine his reason and purification on this day only, restore what remains still.
Therefore, if you are healed, eat; but if not, then understand that the corruption is deep within the body, which has not yet been achieved, and accordingly take action to address it there.
If the bone is ruptured, or it can be extracted by means of delicate forceps which I find suitable for such extraction:
If bones are involved, then very carefully extract all of them without leaving any cause from your strength.
May if any obstruction of the fluids causes it, and there is no fear or mistake in their insight, then you should inspect those ligaments or bones here, and break them down.
If you are not prepared with the bones of your hour (the area around the joint), then place it over the dirt that moistens the surrounding mud, and make sure that this water is outside the environment where those bone fragments from cartilage and ligaments exist; keep wet so as to prevent them from solidifying, and ensure you have constructed the section previously noted in your operation.
Habitually, if one fears being submerged above the oil in three days or beneath Egyptian linens, or among any of their woolen wraps when those bands tighten and bones become separated from each other due to these bindings, they are drawn away.
If there is a great bone in the area of change or similarity with those mentioned above and what from it comes to you spoils only your face for so long, until that which has been ruined goes down as far as possible into where rest remains undisturbed by decay and corruption. Only then restore the body'thy healthy state.
If that which has come from within causes great part of the body and if this damage to bone marrow is already present, it becomes necessary to close that place wherein said destruction came about entirely; thus providing a means by which such affliction can be healed internally.
And you are recommended to bring water into the patient'thy thighs so that it can ease and assist in your operation.
A young man in his state for over xxx years has pain in his groin, and the mucous material of disgorged intestine is on top of the body where it entered, which consists primarily of absorbed matter from the colon (indicating a severe internal inflammation or abscess), not caused externally.
And then the focus extends to that for as long as doctors are mistaken within wherein materials move through a fistula, and pus forms in these channels used by them all previously for drainage of fluids and secretions from the body.
And when the treatment by many doctors for two years has not been successful and focuses on blood within the body instead of outside it, they are called in here.

And then I cut and incised into one of the bones within which I discovered a broken piece, and fixed that corrupted part, it was already earthy and decayed, and discolored; moreover, there was also a damaged portion inside where something had penetrated to the marrow.
And when I discover what has come from bone that was revealed and prepared,
When you have ensured that it is not in the bone but rather that deteriorated condition which had been cut off and sealed shut, then already a separation has occurred.
Returning restoration of health through long-standing medical consolidative practices has not been achieved yet.
Return and explore further on the bones below the knee joints following the initial discovery, while consistently maintaining pressure to prevent damage to the bones.
When I find that which appears as part of this corruption, and perform fair treatment for it to restore health, but is not restored yet.
And now you discover another discomgy and proceed to restore it little by little carefully, repairing the rest of him until an inch is restored within his body; that which was extracted belongs to his marrow, and with medicines he returns what has been taken away, thereby consolidating recovery.

May you notice it in the place of the body already being stretched out by traction; then take that second rope and tighten it at the extremity of that part which is extended, commanding a sharpshooter to extend this rope along its length; pull apart these thick strands from each other (the first one), placing them back over their respective carneal parts in order for flesh spread out between body movements. Once placed like this on the skin's surface where you intend to saw, ensure that no part of it detaches and falls away during cutting.
When you press on their bones or tablets for a while, when it is not forbidden to use the saw that does not spoil healthy flesh.
Where the saw is used over the area that has been gradually damaged, if it occurs in the cavity of bone decay and does not appear at once with sensation, then use another tool on it as well.
If the bones are decayed and not exposed, it is one division continued by another; wherever deterioration occurs within or between divisions, discover all of the affected flesh in its entirety; apply pressure sparingly to these areas until you find the place where continuity exists for further cutting (the corruption). Here, use gentle compression and proceed with the cut from the first identified area.
As for the sewing needle according to the location of the decay, as we have mentioned before.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut out that corrupted joint and saw away from where it connects to the other parts.
If it is in the continuous discharge of joints due to decay or deterioration, then it'dict not by reason but originates from within (inside).
If the corruption is in the chest or abdomen, it's difficult; however, if you seek out where this dysfunction appears to you and remove that part, cleaning each piece according to what seems possible for you as well, then rectify such issues within yourself without causing harm from veins or nerves.
Ensure you understand the instruments and where they should be inserted for these bones according to their situation, as well as their size, texture, fineness or coarseness, smallness or largeness, hardness, rarity; so that whatever tool preparation is suitable for this entire operation.
You understand that this operation concerns the specialty of the instrument you are using; when you have great knowledge and long experience in these instruments, as well as witnesses who know about their use for diseases, then you already possess what is necessary for your tools to serve at all times during treatment.

The extremities are either internally or externally caused, or when you treat that corruption with these medicines and the treatment does not relieve it, sometimes the corruption goes to a part of the body where no cause is perceived by touch; herein lies your duty: insert that limb into this hole so that humors escape from there, preventing their exit through death or malice as they are considered more detrimental to the affected member.
E the name of that person you are curing, is because their limb has turned black inside due to being lamed where the flame burns it off completely or if redness enters within what was burnt during cauterization in this part of the body they have taken care of; hence, torture them internally.

The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be as follows:
When he has returned from me, he comes back on his own land and informs me that this man prepared the whole of it thoroughly, and is cured.
This text appears to be a translation or interpretation of medical knowledge from the medieval period into English:
Of cure for the intestine and quality of enema administration with medicine.
When abscesses form in the patient's flesh and cartilage spaces extend until they accumulate disease (pus), it is then cut open and punctured to drain out the sickness; clean water used for washing, with a thin cloth undernethy thereupon—none has reached elsewhere corruption nor infected bone or nerves/ligaments. It's called by suction without fistula formation:
May it be so that if spaces extend within where the decay affects any part of the body, then it is called a fistula and does not worsen.
The cure for it is that you insert the cane fully into position as turned around and mainly when inserted like a cloth; ensuring they do not stick due to their decay.
If you hope that the bowels will stick together and that this putrefaction has not occurred through any previous action, then when in the intestines there is a face-tofal contact, tend to clean it with enema (cleansing agent).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that which has gone out, and let it flow for so many days until the curve is purified and modesty restored:
Here are the translations for each line of the medieval medical treatise:
If the malady does not tolerate Egyptian medicinal substances or ash water, then cleanse that part with such water mixed with honey and herbs for three times, and wash it with viletta (vinegar) wherein is salt dissolved in wine; because of the property of honey to purify and cleanse, and make flesh sticky so as not to dry out when cleansed.
When you have given some water and find that the belch has risen upwards, then perform a cleansing for what causes discomfort in the body.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And when you take down olive oil and dissolve it, or cleanse that amount with certain medicines and other ointments which already have their properties within the treatment of liniments.
If the contents of the vagina are not absorbed in which no catheter is inserted, then gradually increase that small amount thereof, and pause while wrapped in Egyptian or basic oil until it has been increased.
If the application is extensive, then you will add lips to seal and place as much of it in between what enters with the clyster (enema) as possible.
If the orifice through which blood flows upward causes dryness in the lower parts of it within that place for which the brachial artery runs, then when the brachial artery is compressed by the curvature of the body'dictated where flesh has been generated inside this very location.
If it is not possible to dry the moisture within the body'dictum, then you pierce that which prepares your limb for treatment, according as thou hast prepared and ensure there be in thee no residual cause of disorder from the limb correction process.
May that person who is above the cavity, which warms throughout in such a way that moisture accumulable within their body ascends therein from below (the abdomen), thus preventing it from becoming damp and causing discomfort or illness at any given moment. To understand if what goes through the bowels of a person is moving quickly or slowly, or not at all being digested properly.
And so you should consider that location wherein the patient feels pain or swelling and if it is an abscess present there:
When your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and the material applied sticks to the area of the vagina as well adheres (adherence), then take it out or change/wash the cloth daily when you douching, and renew the ointment.
May it happen that from the sinus space one can introduce small viruses, do not despair of him/her because healing takes place there in those places where flesh generates late and suffers ailments; these are the areas to which his treatment responds.
If of the belly swelling has been indigested for days and it does not adhere (stick together), you will understand that there is no fixation in its location; if delayed attachment occurs, adjust with purgatives from medicine, which when moistened by their essence or virtue, are removed like wax dissolved by damping cloth.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E le mays derier am le qual es curat," which means in English as follows line by line:
And when it seems like that time for intercourse approaches and you have not yet done so, use oil to lubricate what is inside (presumably the vagina), as well as myrrh and aloe, spreading them over the moisture and placing linens on top of where they are applied. Then apply ointment or similar preparation that has been placed there upon it; along with these same substances used previously for external application (myrrh, aloe), powdered together to form a coating above this layer. And finally, the poultice containing what you have inserted inside is applied on top of linens and cloths over this area.
Here are the translations for each line of the medieval medical treatise:
If the swelling is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, you will know that corruption occurs in its origin, and it has already begun to affect the bones or hard parts of the body; at this point, treat it as a fistula, using methods prescribed by doctors above.
De treatment of pains caused by bead and nail irritation, as well as cuts on fingers added with cutting or division.
Panarici is applying the salve that does not dry on this foot or leg of theirs and also elsewhere, with prolonged use which makes its care valuable, meaning an applied cauterization for ulceration, corruption, where bracelets are inserted to combat decay within the lesion'dict skin, making it blackened overall; consequently causing pain at that extremity as well as a darkening of their complexion.
So when you have obtained that amount of water we mentioned in the division and it does not interfsetup your treatment, then remove all excess moisture from the wound using iron instruments, which will promote healing effectively at once.
If the bone is sound and the wound healed, then you will remove additions from the joints using forceps for cutting them out, begin to puncture that which has been paused below the angle of the needle on the bone—this way pushing it inside until there'm nothing left. And pause only as much time needed so not just a little part remains; and when this is done with great care you will be covering up its entirety, keeping all external substances from entering where wounds are healing to ensure complete recovery.
If decay has already entered the bone, then you must insert and extract it here because there is never a time when the bone can heal itself in this state of disrepair.
If the liver and spleen are descending in that part, then you should incise it where its memory is recalled as necessary, and take care to ensure that such thing enters into healing.
May you perform percussion or incision on the spleen where there is intense pain, and dry out (the area) affected by gout with ardor in thirst above transverse abdominal serpent'gyre downward; guard that which has been drawn into it from underneath skin—this causes splenic discomfort due to excessive superfluity of flesh over the location, and take care for there where fluid gives way pain.
May adjust it herein lies within the flesh of all men, for when in meat or bone or nail does reside, thus its essence is contained.
The given medieval medical text can be translated line by line into English as follows: May not one born from dull nuts of this matter suffer much pain; and that which is born at the joints in great force shall be extremely gouty.
From those who are fat and have a yellow section (indicating jaundice), that part is weakened; you must insert it with the bone marrow from the spine for its sake.
May those who are born at the junction find healing difficult; therefore be mindful of his abdomen.
May it happen to those born in this place that you insert the meat into their bodies through the mouth so that one of those knives is suitable for cutting and placed inside there where they are injured; care must be taken that what goes inside becomes healed.
May consolidation that occurs between their movements or due to home birth or the maturation of offspring or combustion of fire, causing them distress until they return back to their normal form within these boundaries.
Here is the translation of each line:
And if it is similar to congealing in the palm of your hand, then dry that congealment as soon as it has been prepared and adjusted according to the shape of the body part.
From weakness of joints, they become swolthy (or possibly misspelled as "swelly"). Here's a possible translation line by line into
From weakness of the joints they become swollen (varicas), and their veins are thickened with melancholy humors that flow into the limbs' parts, primarily in the hips where travelers and workers spend time most often; more frequently observed among laborers and those who walk or carry loads.
Now that you administer the purge of the bowels from cholera blacksome in some doses and improve the patient' extraductile state through their inferior vein (the basilic),
Most of their healing involves two methods: one is that it be made clear and drawn out the black bile, and the other method is raising up the vein and extracting it in full.
The translated text from the medieval medical treatise is as follows:

If you have pain in your bone and suspect osteomyelitis or an abscess that flows outwardly, then immediately apply cold water to the area where it is wet with blood and lymph fluid; this will help calm down the inflammation caused by the suppuration of the marrow, starting treatment at the site of the bone affected and its excision.
And it is one of two methods for operation.
One of the manias is that you insert one instrument into each socket as follows: And this form they implement it by inserting another similar but slightly smaller tool in there. This is how they do it:
E returns medicine that may be applied as second aid.
When various instruments of cutting are used by us and others (we also use them), they cut shorter than those previously made; these ones are iron or steel at the ends where our fingers touch their extremities, located in the back part for sharpness as needed.
Using them for ease in palpation over the joints, so that they do not hit their head and guide it along.
If the bones are hard and sharp, then when you administer injections into their circulatory system (which they call "tunnels"), ensure that these tubes do not go deep.
E for it is not the night but these that rest in the bone of the thigh until dawn whereby they are brought to their round extremity or margin on top which prevents being immersed and passing through the thickness of the bone.
It is convenient that you grasp these many couches of which each one corresponds to the sharpness of any bone within your entire brain, whereby the extent in length and shortness depends on the degree of this sharpness.
This is the form of three kinds of talismans: The quality that allows piercing through the broken bone structure involves stopping and twisting the talisman on the bone, knowing when the bone has been penetrated; then transferring the talisman to another location, pausing until you have traversed all the thickness of the fragment or pieces.

And where you keep all caution that the incision does not touch any cause of phlegm.
And when the bone has traversed through it, and if there is continuation along its path, extract that which comes out from within, for this substance in the liquid of the body appears as hardness similar to knives, but even so, because it may be putrefied matter or subtle essence like other thorns.
If there is any small or painful part of the bones, take that which makes it easier for you to remove them from their joints; and care for these with ointments and liniments as we have described.

If the bone does not penetrate into the periosteum, and where it has broken or remains of the bone is its face, there are roughnesses and fine ligaments present in it; as soon as you recognize those roughnesses and remove them with what tools have been prepared for this purpose from various sizes to ensure that everything suitable can be applied at appropriate places on their body according to when your surgical operation has come along so the fractured bone is put back together, maintaining its correct position.

In this translation of what appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical
When there is a fracture (break) in the jawbone, it's referred to as a mandibular fracture or simply broken
When the jawbone breaks and it's not displaced (not left in its normal position), observe if only one bone is broken without fracturing into two parts or curving towards the divisions of teeth, then their knowledge may be limited.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the jawbone is already separated into pieces, then it's necessary to administer extension of parts in such a way that healing can occur.
If you have caused concomitant dental issues leading to disruption (possibly referring to jaw or bite problems), then tighten those parts which you hope will hold together the filaments of gold/silver/mercury, and apply pressure on the broken mandible socket, as well as over doubled clothing folds, holding a single finger along the length of the mandibula. Secure this armor (probably referring to dental or bite splint), ensuring it does not break while being applied according to how you are dressed and equipped with your instrument/tool for application; in such way that nothing is damaged during its use.
And command the malady (illness) to rest and calm down, stopping it from absorbing food through its stomach lining.
If there is an alteration in the body'dict due to any disease or disorder of mind (mania), then you should apply pressure and remove that which has already been disturbed on the third day; rectify what has become changed from it, placing ointment made with honey, albumen [egg whites], or semolina flour around the body. Apply this dressing while pressing over the linted wool padding (compreso di panno lanoso).
And when that bandage is placed and positioned on the body without altering bone structure, let it allow for healing if injured to become strong again or else this fracture will be set in three sessions.
If another bleeding accident occurs as an aspersion (likely referring to a blister or similar skin lesion), then apply what we have mentioned for wounds and allow it inside the patient' extraneous parts until healed; this will also treat that ulceration.
If the fracture is wet (moist), consider if it'se separated bone or loose, then you should handle those loosened parts with water that brings them back to where they belong in the body during their recovery process.
If the poultice applied by the patient is insufficient, then apply more as needed on the foot using a cloth (fleubotomi).
When you have removed those satagias (presumably a type of remedy or treatment), and there is no residue remaining, if so apply plaster to the area where it was extensive; otherwise, rest on one of the supports that are convenient for this purpose, until healed.
The given line contains an abbreviation "Capitol," which is
When you hinge at the collarbone (furcula), it implies a movement related to bending or articulation in that area of the body, possibly
When moving habitually (continuously), the collarbone of a player can be broken due to overuse or excessive strain on one of three ways: avulsion, where some bone is torn away by muscle attachment; fracture-dislocation, involving both break and joint misalignment; or simple fracture without dislocation.
When it is broken or separated into parts that do not join together again (like bones), and healing in those places will be difficult, as if the breakage were on land animals – here begins its restoration; but to mend these fractures can only happen through plaster. Here indicates a situation where there'supressed or dislocated joints that do not come back together naturally (like bones), and healing is hard in those places, as if the breakage were among animals found on land – this signifies starting its repair; however, to fix these fractures can only be done using plaster.
When the operation in that case occurs because of a broken sternum (furcula), it is necessary to have two servants: one takes care and holds his hand for support, while the other extends their arm over that section which has been divided.

Here comes the first sentence to translate: The minister presses on the muscle of him at intervals until the bone of the shoulder blade is raised above in his shoulders, and then he corrects the fracture with those tools therein provided.
If you feel chills in the throat and headache worsening (sic: "furcula" might mean fever or forehead region, as furcula is not a standard term), then break through that area and remove those symptoms easily.
If it is retained in the bone, then you will make an incision on one of those instruments which have been prepared for this purpose (bone drill), and place them where they serve at the sternum joint; these are made of wood or iron.
It seems like the source sentence is trying to compare something in the body with a rooster and its position relative to other parts of it:
May the length of it be as far as you can for the operation; that there should be two arms with each one full and stretched out.
If the disruption of the flesh you have inlaid when extracting the bone is wide open and at risk for slippage, then adjust the wound edges with stitches as soon as possible.
If the rupture is slight or you fear atrophia cutis (skin hardening), then apply poultices and powders according to the quantity of ground flesh, which has been torn apart.
If you have an abscess that is being drained open with a cautery and vinegar and oil on it, pause over there.

Restoration of the shoulder fracture.
Spatula's blade is broken at its place and not in it, but along its edges.
And when the place of him — and it is broken in his heat location — can only be recognized by touch, then according to how fracture forms itself prepares you for your intervention and reduce that part following its natural form as much as within your means.
Return the pillow over the spot where moisture and albumen (egg white) have accumulated, as well as a folded cloth double layer; place it gently on top of the small stone slab underneujt according to the quantity measured by the entire spatula or perhaps just one portion.
If the stone is concave in some of the locations on the scalpel, then you grasp that indentation with forceps and flatten it out evenly along the blade edge; now adjust the position of the scalpel accordingly.
Return strength from above, far removed from contracture and the firmness of the stone within their body so that it is not reabsorbed into its place.
Consider the ligament each day; and every time it is softened, stretch it gently with a rope if it has become swoldon at its place.

Capitol VII. (Note: "Capitol" here may refer
In the context of treating a bone break, specifically referring to something related to stabilizing or setting the broken leg ("pietzo"), this
The bone (pietzo) sometimes breaks and is exposed in the warmth of its location, with hands being beaten and fractured therefrom. Here, it'dicts that when a broken leg or femur becomes visible due to swelling—often from an inflammatory response caused by heat exposure ("mieg") near where injured (the "loc de lu"), which could signify the need for immediate medical intervention as extremities may be further dam
From the accidents at hand when they break through their own warmth (the heat exposure leading potentially to inflammation), there comes great pain, difficulty in movement and coughing; these are declared openly even within the broken bone's cavity—and not hidden from one’s senses. This line underscores that severe symptoms such as intense discomfort, trouble moving (limitation of locomotion), and perhaps a worsening respiratory condition like coughing can be indicative signs associated with the injury to bones or joints ("trencat le mieg"). The fact these are "openly declared in the cavity" implies that they cannot remain unnoticed by an individual's immediate perception, suggesting a clear understanding and awareness of one’
For the treatment of their patient (referring back), they are meant to lie supine with a hernia placed over one's two shoulders; and adjust the muscles as needed while positioning your chest atop twice its natural height, performing delicate movements throughout all procedures allowed by practical means—and ensuring that afterward returns their bone (os) back into form. Herein lies advice on handling a patient with symptoms possibly related to hernia ("malaute") and the subsequent steps for manipulating not only this issue but also other aspects of care, as dictated by feasibility until they are once more like oneself after recovery—this suggests techniques used in manual therapy or rehabilitation. The goal is likely positioning that could alleviate pressure on a herniating structure and facilitate its reduction back into the correct anatomical location ("retorne la figura del os segon que cove"), emphasizing careful, skilled handling to promote healing without further injury or discomfort for both patient and practitioner.
Here comes the translation for each line:
If it is necessary to provoke dismemberment of that which has corrupted or crumbled away therein, causing pain, ulceration, as I have seen in the location below - then use your tool and remove what causes this decay; correct any related humors according to their nature. Apply treatment here if required for the face area (if necessary), adjusting strictures so that it may heal properly within you or patient:

From restoring coastlines when they are fractured or broken down: When the shoreline is damaged due to natural events like storms
Know that the fracture of coastlines occurs in large areas where they are joined together, and from their limbs' departure we do not take them directly to those junctions but through channels because these conduits are made of stone-like materials: Understanding that when a breakdown or damage happens along extensive shoreline regions—where the land meets sea at its edge forming unified strips—we don’t simply transport limbs (sediments) straight away to those junction points. Instead, we use natural channels in their composition which are stony and robust for this task: Here it means that when repairing And I realize there is not a conflict between the inquiry of you who seek knowledge about these matters (shoreline restoration and treatment). You do not find yourself troubled by doubts or questions when seeking to understand this subject: The speaker acknowledges
The restoration process is to be done according to the possible manner within which it can occur; and I will apply bandaging tightly as well as firm compression on those bones that have become dislocated at these junctions (coastlines), if required by you: The speaker outlines their plan for addressing coastal damage, promising a restoration method tailored to the specific situation. They mention applying direct pressure with bandages and possibly splints or similar devices on any bones that have been displaced due to fractures at these critical junction points where land meets sea (coastlines). This indicates an immediate response aimed at stabilizing injuries before a more comprehensive repair can
If the backbone fracture is declining into parts, it will cause severe pain and piercing sensation as if with a needle pricking that person who has coughed up blood (hemoptysis), causing difficulty in breathing, cough, vomiting of material similar to fresh snow (to mucus resembling froth or foam); this condition is hard to treat.

The text provided seems to be in a language with Latin roots, possibly medical terminology or instructions related to orthopedic care for cervical and thoracic vertebrae injuries
The text appears to discuss the treatment of thoracic (chest) and cervical vertebral fractures in English: When you pour vinegar into the wound and wish to know if it will heal or not, then consider that if your hands are already soiled and numb, and you cannot clean them nor extend/strengthen them at this moment when tightening those tendons is needed with a needle, thus realizing they do not cure. In the preparations for dispositions where it's fatal.

If you see that there are swellings on the back of his/her neck and wish to know whether they cure or not, then pay attention to their feet.
When you feel that it has already been softened, apply those waters to the areas where they have occurred on your belly and back, as breathing and digestion will occur naturally through desire, causing some ones' hips to rise upwards and urinate involuntarily; when you realize this is mortal, then do not attempt treatment.
May if there is not any underlying cause for that, it's worse and requires a simpler cure.
And the treatment of it is that you perform ablations with a caustic applied to the spinal disc affected or eroded by rust, placed there for several hours until the inflammation subsides due to the application of the caustic.
And when one of the cushions for comfort and existing, rests upon that which is threaded therein; command the humors to repose and tranquility, not sleeping on the portion where pain resides so it may heal.
If you have caused damage to the bone structure or if there is already some cause that has been separated from it, then apply pressure on the spine and hold onto that bone; adjust the lips of your instruments for large wounds, and take care of this part within where flesh remains attached with skin.
May it break the bone in your leg and be the time of the coccyx (tailbone), where you insert your hand into its left side for healing purposes until possible by leggings; pause over this area with plastering/casting, if needed from these objects. And strengthen that very part accordingly.
If you feel sharp pains in the flesh, attend to that area and apply pressure there, curing with care what has been provided before it heals within itself.

When the bones of such cases are broken (the phrase "les osses de las anchas tart so trencats" indicates a situation where someone may have suffered from significant trauma leading to dislocated or possibly shattered limbs), it is not just fracture but communication between their extremities at that location; they plunge downwards towards the divisions (suggesting injury alignment and movement away from normal anatomy). The wound causes pain in that place, where a hole has been made ("loc e punctura"), with the lint placed there appearing astonished or affected when fractured.
The restoration of it is that you extend your hand over where there is a figure representing the patient, which indicates an injury or breakage depicted by their body shape and positioning.
If the bone is broken in just that limb of yours alone, then you must wrap it with cloth or bandage as tightly as possible until someone who knows how to dress wounds enters and restores it back into its normal shape.
May it be that if the fracture is long or already declining to its parts, then you shall speak with the malady within your abdomen until you are prepared for the restoration of that fracture. And when it has been immobilized on the splint or with a bone or metal device over that joint obstruction without fear of fracture penetration or displacement of the spine,

This passage describes two bones that together form a limb; among these is one small and referred to as the 'tittle finger,' which corresponds with what we call our thumb, while another large serves as its counterpart located nearer the joint of separation.
When either the large or small fire (heart/fire within) is broken entirely and completely shattered into pieces, it means that there has been a significant breakdown of these vital organs according to medieval medical beliefs about humoral imbalance affecting heart function. Here's how we can translate this
When the small fire (heart) below is broken entirely and completely shattered, restoration of it becomes doubtful or challenging, making healing difficult for that person according to medieval medical beliefs about humoral imbalance affecting heart function. Here'thy first source sentence translated into English with focus on potential difficulties in the treatment process:
When the patient's fire is broken off for a long time, their bone breaks down and healing becomes difficult.
When that bone has been broken from there, it is when they are shattered into pieces.
So if the bone that has been broken is undernethy (the upper part of the thigh), it's convenient for the doctor; you must restore it so briefly until such time as this can be done comfortably within where he/she would lie down.
May it be that if a large fire is what we need (to treat), then I have already caused an extension forcefully and powerfully with my hands.
If the two points are in contact and you pause their withdrawal motion gently, do so with strength.
When the figure of the hand must be rested and extended over a pillow, its palm on the parts below it, place all others accordingly, with their hands positioned here as well, and each other's ears placed at the bases of these others, while the head is kept centred upon a lowering couch.
If there is a hernia present now under or between the patient'dict in their abdomen and chest area, it will not worsen further by doing nothing (implying intervention).
When it is necessary for the minister (doctor) on one side to extend their arm from below or above the chest, and another minister appears similarly extending his own hand downwards/upwards, then so be done accordingly with care.
When the doctor touches the patient' extrinsic bone that has been stretched, doing so according to what is possible with their best shape or form.
If in the bone'section there is excess pressure, it causes pain throughout the entire body at your will.
If there appears in you separate seed (likely referring to pus or some form of inflammation) that pushes the navel and is not within your hope for restoration, then attend upon it here and apply what has been directed from above.
May if the bone is broken and thus draws blood alone (singularly), then take care of that very wound.
If you lance an abscess at the site of your restoration, then take linen wound dressing soaked in olive oil and beeswax white, and bind it between tightness and subtlety; place that bandage firmly over the area where the abscess has burst until it subsides; remove the bandage and apply a plaster made of powdered honey mixed with crushed lime (chalk), then pause for stability.

Whenever you recline inside for rest and return the constriction (tightness), here it is said.
If extraction has become softened and the bones appear to be returning to their places, then straighten out all of it with your own effort.
Consider if the nourishment is prohibited to prevent damage to that part of the body due to excessive tightness; provided you soften it slightly and strengthen it within the days until such time as this necessary nutrition can be obtained for him/her again.
If in the patient' extramural area there is not any cause of those mentioned above, do not attempt to extract it within two days or outside from these conditions.

And when the place where you have applied an emplastrum and bandage is not healing ulcers without cauterization; apply a stopping stone above according to the size of the wound, which area you have already wrapped in cloth.
May it be that the bruising is in the parts of the wound and appears like drape threads, then order the malady to contract those areas with its own hand strongened by cloth; make sure this contraction extends along the length of the threaded area.
And if it is necessary for the body's core to rest on the cloth wherein it rises (probably referring to some form of support or bedding), then tightly clothe that second layer, and strengthen this one next in order.
If the fracture is in the parts beyond repair, then cease striking above and below stone fragments of that part which are located on your palm; this way it will be protected (covered) and tightened up; furthermore pause the sprain, as you revolve your hand between the fingers at the joints.
If you break the bones of your fingers, and if it's the finger that is broken, then rub it with branches as directed by their use or apply pressure using a small stone from its palm leaf; if you wish to do so, pause on this smaller asthenia for four days until the fracture has healed and will not become swolthy.
May it be the same as in that joint of warmth or on indication, or at the earlobe, or around the ankle ring—this is where one applies pressure with their finger to this specific spot; if they are all lined up continuously, better soaked over there like we do here for the foot.
Consider when in your restoration the application and positioning of applied caustic to oppose—at work time this treatment is done whenever a cause related thereto as narrated by you comes up.

If the patient expels seed (urine), then you must contract them to hold it in so that they can be ground over there where it has stopped flowing; if for another reason not present at your side is causing this issue, address that cause as well.
When beginning to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless there is an ulceration (aplasia).
May you cauterize the ulcer, then restore it within one day until it subsides, and do not apply again on the third day after today; thereafter, bad accidents will occur.

When a bone fracture is healed, and the limber and flexible part of the member are returned to them: not all this will be pain unless caused by certain reasons: such as excessive tightness in ligaments through which nourishment must not run; or too much padding between tendons where sustenance cannot circulate freely. Or perhaps from an overabundance of prolapsing flesh within the abdomen and to expel it (likely referring to a hernia).

Here's the translation focused
When a limb is restored to health after straightening out its bending and elevation of the broken part, prevention measures are taken against such actions on that body member; however, this does not forbid natural healing interventions for an existing fracture: This line emphasizes care in handling injured or deformed limbs once they have been put back into proper alignment. The text underscores the balance between allowing nature's own methods of bone repair and avoiding actions that could disrupt this process, such as unnecessary manipulation following restoration which might lead to further injury rather than healing a new break in an already weakened structure due to its previous state after trauma.

The text suggests specific methods of application, including the use of natural substances like marshmallow gumliner known for its mucilaginous properties that provide soothing effects when applied as a cold compress or poultice – which should not be excessively heavy (no more than two pounds). Alternatively, fatty preparations from plants such as fennel seeds ground into meat pats and figs steeped in honey were used for their consolidative properties. These remedies are likened to Egyptian medicines known within that culture's traditional medical literature ("consolidacio"). The passage reflects a period when poultices, compresses, and natural substances played significant roles in the treatment of various conditions before modern pharmacology was established.

From speech in relation to dislocation. The phrase "de sermo en dislocacio
Dislocation is an injury of any one of the joints in your body, which results in immobility and it's necessary to summon a doctor; this brings about severe pain throughout the humerus (the upper arm bone). Here "dislocacio" refers specifically to dislocation wherein there is no movement possible. A medical professional must be contacted as such injuries can lead not only to acute, potentially debilitthyizing and spreading pains but also serious musculoskeletal damage ("lesios grans").
Therefore, when a patient suffers from a joint dislocation, it is crucial to promptly perform reduction (repositioning of the bone back into place), and immediate action should be taken; if delayed, there may result an avulsion fracture where pieces of bone are torn away. If not addressed in time following a dislocation ("le loc es apostemat"), relocating it becomes increasingly difficult due to potential damage from being out for too long without intervention (“fort leu am aquo es fayta dificil la reduccio de dislocacio”). Here, the urgency of treating a joint dislocation is underscored as delays can lead not only to
And for those who do not have the means or ability to receive immediate care during reduction (such as due to lack of resources like money—“maugut”) or being stranded without access ("stendut en la hora de") medical help, prolonged suffering often follows with spasms and severe pain.

In this case, while doing so, saliva must flow from the mouth (or ‘malax’), preventing it from holding onto any position outside of its natural joint space. Additionally, the tongue is wrapped in language to assist with manipulation.

When you have cracked the joints (hips), reduce it to its cavity so that healing is cauterized wound; if a caustic burn has occurred in him, difficult and often not fully healed unless at the posterior parts where all other species of dislocation occur with greater pain and recurrent movements towards there which leads mostly to death.
When it is possible to restore him, that his body (the patient) should be extended with both hands and arms expanded, and the doctor' extricates their extremities from between thighs and knees, or into the palm of their hand so as they may return to their original place.
May it be that if the dislocation is in progress towards the parts (meaning joints or limbs), return immediately and bend your hand back to its position inside where you can hear a crack when pressing on the area of the displacement, which is under the palm'softhe patient.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, holding each other' extraneous object (likely the cautery), to prevent excessive extension of it.
And turn your arm completely around, placing a long cloth or bandage over the area of it, binding tightly with thread or leather strap (ligature).
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil to it so that this helps alleviate its causes and lubricates the joint movement—apply pressure until the joint is back in place.
And apply the reduction of him that has been paused upon that paste in which his fixation and outflow are from bone marrow fatty deposits, and is extended by strictures below, with the arm suspended from the collarbone, resting on pillows for several days.
And it is separated; and therefore if the joint formation occurs at that place, separate its ligaments and apply them there.
If you see the joint not swolthy and tight, then apply the plaster and ligature to it for several days until it is drawn out; return that same thing afterward.
If crushing weight is applied to the reduction of the joint and its positioning is in movement, then administer moistened and dry warmth therapies until it subsides; once rest at the joint where there's a fatty motion cough (indicating pain or inflammation), tighten it up again, placing another one on bone/chest area holding their hands. Return that one to the bath; when sucked dry, friction is applied on that joint where there are movements and grunts of discomfort, once a day for relief #1, and again tomorrow (and the next), continuing this process: Am in bath, entering wherein is lubricated (liturgically interpreted as meaning "where there'thy already been a washing/b
And pause over that hollow of moist and split wood at the edge, stretch it out so (perhaps this refers to applying pressure or manipulating something), then apply some lubrication; as such, make sure that place is properly arranged/adjusted again in its position. The sentence suggests a medical practice where after examining an area of moisture and damage at the edge—potentially referring to swelling from effusion (fluid accumulation) or injury – the practitioner would apply lubrication, possibly poultices made with ointments derived from
In Capitulum XXVIII: After noting a wet and gashed hollow
Concerning the care of joint displacement between arm and body (this likely refers to a specific type or area that requires medical attention). The phrase indicates an examination within this context where understanding dislocation—a severe injury often involving misalignment at certain junctures, such as between
Of the joints that have been dislocated in some cases (referring to instances where a limb has suffered such an injury), and realignment is easier; however, even here it must be noted whether there was immediate intervention or if delay led to development of apatematism. The passage emphasizes prompt treatment for the best outcomes when dealing with dislocations in various joints (possibly including shoulders, elbubtons, knees), suggesting a principle where swift action is crucial and complications such as delayed healing ("apatema") can arise from not addressing injuries at once.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you suspend the joint between the thigh and buttocks on a table, and have someone extend this limb; while the doctor or their hand/palm rests over the impending joint movement to push it back into place.
Mays if the palm is left on the stomach of them, then let the hump be above their body and resting on a table; and if it has dislocated beforehand must position her belly from that intrinsic point directly onto the table so that the doctor's abdomen can rest over this impending joint.
And if it returns soon, good things follow; but if not, that area will become swollen and tighten further until the appointed time passes without relief. Do not attempt to intervene or apply pressure on this reduction process happening over several days.
May the joint according to its twistiness; and not from within the malady, but rather it is soothed and cannot be strengthened any further—for you understand that the nerves are compressed or spasmed, and only in this way can your cautery properly tend to healing at rest, while also providing firm support against water.
So when they return discomfalshed (malassement), apply the one that has been recommended to them, and bind it tightly for days on end; likewise cut off its head (decretum) and strengthen and exercise it with water as directed.
If the patient' extrication from gravity is necessary and there are some pains in their lower or upper body parts due to it, apply heat immediately by means of a hot bath (or foment) while ensuring they remain seated until relieved.
Capitol XXIX.
Of joint displacement treatment.
When joints have been dislocated all over the body.
When a joint is dislocated from either of those two (palms or belly), then straighten the limb and pull it back into place until return occurs.
And support the head of this person, and suspend that limb from which they are dislocated, placing it so for two days.
Return those inside it that have entered and extended within in that very day.
When soreness does not cease, that second account tells us to let it rest during the day and exercise in motion at night; do so until healing occurs within these days.
When it seems like water (referring to the patient's condition), and if dislocated in their belly, bring that back to where they belong, performing the first operation with water until healed.
When it is made of water when displaced to other parts of the body.
Since I don'thy provide any text for translation from "Capit
The phrase you provided, "Curacio di dislocazione dei vertebre nel dorso," translates to English as:
When a disc in the back or neck is completely dislocated and motionless vertebrae crowd into that space immediately, it cannot be cured herein; for death comes to the spleen (suggesting internal injury).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The name of this fluid is diarrhea; it cannot be retained by her, and its effects are softened in the members of her body or on her thighs/hips or shoulders (two arms), sometimes resulting in a spondylolisthesis at that place. Often these occurrences happen repeatedly over time periods.
Therefore, it has become swolthy at the back parts and is namelessly gloomy.
May the cure of it be that if there is a yellowish discoloration due to youthfulness, neither in this nor its remedy will heal completely everything.
May return to the learned ways of treatment through eloquent speech from which they may revert; and if necessary, remove what is causing discomfort (the excess heat) from that place with ease due to their closeness or proximity, as this has made them aware and formed a plan using various tools provided by it.
From those it is not healed except for that which you apply directly on them with the liquid they recommend.
It is that the swelling spreads across their face above the chin due to excessive moisture from sweating and extends quickly downwards along the body, ensuring it does not affect the patient'dict breast tissue.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place a straight staff upright on the ground at the foot' extraterritory of the patient and another axe in their legs, respectively opposite each other at the leg's extreme part.
The minister grips the staff and does not keep it in a hole; another minister holds on to that form of the other'thy hand.
Here comes the translation:
Here the minister extends the ligature to the part of the beam where they are fixed, but not tightened excessively as we have mentioned before.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "The doctor places his hands on the spondyl at its strength within which it returns, and adjusts their weights upon that same table until they return.
If it does not return through this form, then take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and carve into the wall where we have stated that the hernia should be located within its extreme limit on the side of the table. Here comes the first sentence to translate: Place your hand on the table surface over the spinal column (spine), and let the doctor hold their feet on the other extremity, so that the spine is compressed and returns to its original place.
If you wish to twist the matter within it; and in order for your head (the top part of a patient'thy body) not to come out on the back side of two sticks, its length is that between one arm and another – as long as an arm itself - with both ends at the waist end of these same sticks. Each stick has this particular extension; thus ensuring your head stays put in place so it does not become gout (suffer from joint pain).
And take a staff in which he turns himself back and forth between the two sticks.
In the limb there is a fault where it forms its staff, whose length is as much water that has been turned (referring to joint swelling), and in the other two staves they seem similar.
Return the ligaments you have broken in the hips to where they belong on your body and fix those that are stretched out at the joints of your legs, which is necessary for maintaining balance when walking (holding one' extricates oneself from it).
And for each turn and position you need one servant who holds the twist at its place, and the doctor manipulately adjusts the spine as we have discussed.
And I placed it back in its place, and covered the location with gauze soaked in albumen (egg white), pressing gently over that layer of egg white bandaged around the table' extrusion device where measurements are taken; this amount should absorb from the wound site on the spondyl.
Return its ligaments as we have discussed, and place the malady'dictor (nutrient carrier) inside so that it heals.
If there is any chance of infection at the site of healing, then immediately apply medicines that moisten and cleanse for long-term treatment as recommended; and a layer of lead has already been applied to this location.
And when some signs of urgency appear at the lower ends of the vertebrae in the back, and it is due to that dislocation; this one from which you already sense approaching harmful consequences for yourself without taking any measures herein described, will lead straight to your death.
Capitol .xxxi. (The text provided does not contain enough information
In reference to a hernia, the Latin phrase "curacio" suggests treatment or care for that
Understanding that the hernia at the joint of the thigh and muscle is dislocated only so much without wounding those waters which you might harm in other smaller body parts with convexity or indentation, indicating a need for careful treatment to avoid causing additional injuries during therapy.
The thigh joint is dislocated in four ways: at the divisions of bones (bone segments), or behind them, forward from them, towards them, and behind them—detailing various possible locations for herniation within the thigh area that need to be assessed by a physician.
Mostly it is at bone segments and barely towards or behind them—further emphasizing that the predominant location of herniation tends to be where different parts meet (bone joints), with very little occurring toward you or backward, guiding attention primarily to specific anatomical zones for evaluation
The term for the dislocation of your limb at bone segments is when you adjust the pillow underne017_health]the hernia and place it back in, doing so with great force (and thus potentially worsening) that which should be healed. This may result in straining what was previously healthy into a worse state; your arm cannot bend at this joint without risking harm to the surrounding tissue—essentially where you might insert cauterizing pads for treatment, ensuring direct contact with diseased areas so that relief can be applied precisely. The passage describes handling of hernia care and highlights risks associated with incorrect application which could exacerbate conditions rather than ameliorate them.
The translation of this line from medieval Latin-influenced text would be in English as follows:
When the name of that individual to whom dislocation occurs at present expands under pressure on one cushion secondarily complemented, it may still not double their current pain in the joint itself; urine is retained and his swelling becomes punctured, and he must walk with you on his toe.
When the name of that person to whom you have caused dislocation in their parts behind cannot expand the belly (abdomen) nor bend what is already bent therein, and put a short cushion under them as well as servants on their legs and chest holding hands.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and indeed if the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been addressed by your current administration in a manner according to its disposition; consequently, do not expect cure herein entirely.
In that in which the dislocation is recent and one of its four species, then turn your head to realign the joint and extend it back to the limbs' parts above and below them, as well as right and left sides respectively; this action alone returns strength without needing other treatments.
May happen if it does not return in this manner: should you prepare strong medicine and extend the cushion under your legs quickly (or slowly), or apply lubricating oil on top of that removed section, have another servant spread said medication above them; also employ a firm lint over where their leg meets with what remains below it. Have yet another servant lightly touch those extremities to make sure they are not disturbed by the movement and finally tighten lint around there (the area between the skin folds), ensuring all hands remain in place during this procedure.
When there is extension from the head down towards the joint of the neck or between the shoulder blade and the chest region, it means that:
And if their extension of all these into a period until the sickness (gout) rises up above its ground and begins to fall downward,
This specific type of extension is common among all four (or could be understood as 'all people'). Here's what I have translated line by line from the medieval text into English, following your format
So if the dislocation returns when we have discussed it here (implying previously mentioned advice or treatments), then be warned and sober; but if not, all that is necessary for its proper care has been stated by us. Here's a line-bypective translation: "Therefore, should the dislocation return to where they are now when we have said this (referring back to earlier discussion on treatment), heed caution and sobriety; but if
In the reduction of oneself, when it has become dislocated, and the displacement is at its joints (implying specific locations where movement or pain occurs), place your malady above their chest; apply pressure over the region between one's shoulder blade and down to where they have been positioned with a pillow. Furthermore, extend the ligaments in all parts of the arm from the point of dislocation towards its joint at the elbow (indicating how far along the limb or specific body part this should be addressed). Here is what I translated line by line:
Here comes another minister with powerful purgative to apply on the thighs of patient and extend it deeply into each section for vigorous expulsion; when that returns back to its place.
This specific substance is for purulent inflammation, by which this limb is reduced and the other ones are cured.
May it be excused over you and not obeyed to this particular method of healing for all together; provided that the two knees of the thighs are already firmly linked by ligaments, both legs and feet, then continue with these treatments as directed herein.
Whenever any part of a person' extruded body length is four times the diameter thereof, and when the thigh bulges out more than two diameters in extension, then:
And raise the hernia over the head of the staff and keep it in place on its bed; such is the length from this person to two cubits (approximately six feet) according to the land's measurement.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And command a strong lad that shortens the thigh's head, and he is suspended in the waist by another young man; likewise, the other youth strengthens it at its peak, so that the joint returns to its proper place with swiftness.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from its place outside, where the humors of illness flow over the knee according to what we have recorded in our observations; and his ligaments are properly placed on the swolthy limb both underneath and upon his chest.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to his/her own portion; and the doctor holds in their mouth the reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs at the joints, then it is covered that they spread outwards; and according to this treatise I describe pain; and the doctor presses his palm'thy hand on the affected thigh area, while he also applies pressure with the other hand onto where there was compression.
If the dislocation is at the joints behind, they will not cover up to expand it onto the parts below and raise above the ground; where there are those who have covered what has caused her displacement from the joints forward (if she herself is also dislocated), according to what we said about this matter. There should be no worry as long as these measures are taken, even if they stretch on both wide ends of it. Moreover, their faces and ligaments will extend outwards accordingly; there's nothing else for concern here.
When compression is applied with a pillow over the location where pain has entered,
So that when the reduction is complete as instructed, and you should not harm it (the reduction of your patient), extend cushions from below their thighs, then after tightening those belts again allowing excess to expand outwards, understand that the corresponding limb returns to position; adjust hinges and pauses with appropriate bands so as not for the thickness thereof is protruded in any part of the body. Keep it elevated on pillows or bandages for three days or four.
When it is necessary to tighten and compare one strap with another,
And if you see those unusual in your presence, then know that the dislocation is already closed, and so let it go away with the humors (fluids).
If you see any cause of suppuration (infection), return and bandage that area according to your first dressing technique, and apply pressure with the second layer as needed; leave it there for three days.
In return, apply that; allow it time for walking on these (likely therapeutic devices or treatments) over several days until they are comfortable.
(Note: The provided text seems like an attempt at translating medieval medical termin
The phrase "curacio de dislocacio del denolh" appears to be in a language related to Latin, possibly Med
The phrase "Le denolh es dislocat segon tres manieyras," when translated into English line by line with an attempt to maintain the original intent and context, could be interpreted as:
The command for the patient' extruded part is that you order the malady to apply its cushion there, where it has been displaced.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And for the restoration of all limbs is that you make haste with your thighs (fasten and secure them), so as they may extend their cushion, if possible over it; bind the body'dict below its face, pausing the leg between these hands. Also apply pressure on the navel using your palms, keeping those interchangeable for strengthening while guiding back the intestine to where it belongs (return to cavity). Another servant extends their limb within so that can occur:
When it is about a person'thy recovery, their cushion clings at the hip joint without strain or effort.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return that and fix it on the couch at the thighs, and apply those same ones there for three or four days, applying them as directed.
No use the humoral balance of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of him is sufficient, then apply strong extension force to the ligaments mentioned in his previous joint recovery treatment.
The provided text is an attempt at translating what appears to be medical advice from
From the phrase "de la curacio di la dislocazione del tallone," a possible translation into English would be:
The ankle occasionally is twisted due to minor movement or displacement; the twist of it occurs in either joints' parts or at their bases.
The translation of each line into English is as follows:
May healing of the body be through gentle restoration and ease for all parts, so that it is extended with convenience and kept within until return.
When in the healing process it is time to dislocate according to complementary measure, do this carefully with force and care for that minister who stands behind you here at your place of rest.
And return your hand to the belly of the swolthy lower body portion you're touching, and place it on your left side in the area where the pelvis is located at its bony cage.
Return the leg to your left hand for three times, and with two turns of your right hand, extend it outward; press on the chest bone held by your left hand until the cushion' extruded operates smoothly.
When fluids have accumulated for some time as directed,
Returns the patient' extricates backwardly into its belly seat and you are at the couch/bedding:
So then if the leg returns in one or two followings of this treatment and also when you see that the foot is swollen again, he is well (recovered), but otherwise repeat the operation until recovery occurs.
If you are not allowed to reduce it in the water that we have recommended, then complain about your thighs on their two lands above ground; and enclose them with a tight cloth such that there is space between their thighs, which you already enveloped around them with a drape so they do not expose themselves.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the doctor manipulately aligns the displacement back to its joints (their thigh bones), and another minister holds the healthy hip joint in place until it returns into position, that is when the displacement comes back together smoothly.
When the dislocation is returned and it's declared to you that healing has occurred due to tight binding/casting applied outside, continue applying pressure firmly on those stitches (ligatures), securing the foot to its limb joint.
Where you fear or protect the nerves located behind the ankle, to ensure that the ligament over it is not excessively stretched and strong.
Return it within two or three days, and if the bandage softens, remove that one out.
Return that part of it in the day or at night for forty days, and prevent arthritis from foods by forbidding them. If you forcefully go into that space, it is not guaranteed that the detachment will not occur there and ruinous, nor can one expect to receive healing care.
If you apply a poultice to the wound where we described it previously in this account of care and bandaging, ensure that it is moistened with liquid from which precedes our narration; use another part for treatment or dressing elsewhere until its supply has been replenished.
The provided text is quite challenging due to its mix of elements from different languages; however
When translated into English, the line could read as: "Regarding the treatment for detachment in the feet." This suggests that it's likely
The translation of the line into English could be: "Regarding those who are dislocated and squeezed a little with pain; if it is not difficult to relocate them." Here, this medieval medical treatise describes an approach for treating foot dislocation where gentle pressure (or 'a pauca extención') can help realign the displaced bones ('ses trabaja'), and when possible, they should
The translation into English would be: "When the dislocation occurs in a joint of your foot (the big toe), then cover and hold that part between your mouth or table with pressure as you were before." This line suggests using body weight or applying force on oneself to provide traction, aiming for self-mobilization if possible. It's an indication from the text directing individuals how they might manage a dislocation without professional medical intervention during that time period.
The translation of this line into English would be: "Apply your own weight to the toe above it on where you intend for these joints [the dislocated ones] to connect, and firm pressure there that keeps them within as they return; see if then already has its jaw back in place without appearing prominent." This text is instructing someone who might be treating their own foot injury with a technique called 'pressure immobilization', whereby applying weight on the joint above can help maintain alignment ('return') and prevent any further displacement. It also seems to advise monitoring for signs of improvement or potential issues during recovery, as indicated by checking if there is less prominpective signalling in this area after treatment with
