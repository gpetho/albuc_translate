On the method of cauterizing in cases of chronic tearing.
Chapter 14.
When tears of the eyes are chronic, continuous, and located over the veins and arteries on the external surface of the head, it is confirmed that this is due to cold, phlegmatic excesses. Then cauterize with the same cautery I described at the beginning for descending fluid, with a cautery at the middle of the head, two cauteries over both temples, and two cauteries at the neck under the two bones.
And if you need to add more, then cauterize it on each side near the eye, on the tip of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
