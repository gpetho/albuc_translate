Chapter Two.
On fractures occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are many, their forms are varied, and their causes are diverse. Among fractures, some are caused by a sword blow, which may either shave off the entire bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone...
As an adze does with wood.
This type of fracture is therefore called adze-like.  Or, the sword stroke may cut part of the bone and shave only its surface, without penetrating through it completely; this type of fracture is called a simple avulsion. The wound of these two types of fractures can be either large or small.
And among fractures, there are those that are comminuted or crushed, caused by a blow from a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these two types of fractures can also be either large or small.  And among fractures are those that are hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair; this is a minor fissure.
This type of fracture is therefore called hair-like. And there are fractures that result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, which pushes part of the bone inward, creating a depression, just as happens to a copper pot when struckâ€”a part of it is pushed inward.
This occurs most often in heads with soft bone, such as the heads of children.  All these types of fractures may have loose fragments or fragments that are not loose; we will discuss the treatment of all of these in their proper place. We recognize all of these types of fractures by examining them.
And by probing them and removing the corrupted flesh from them.  As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it, and applying ink to it; the fracture will then appear black.  As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms clearly indicating danger, such as vomiting bile, stretching, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you, and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after being injured, and it is during the winter,
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. If it is during the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted, causing the symptoms we described to appear.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is shattering and bruising, you should cut away the shattered, bruised part as I will describe to you.  This involves shaving the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, depending on the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling when exposing the bone, address it as appropriate.
This is done by packing the area with rags soaked in rose syrup and oil, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then proceed to trepan the bone and extract it, which can be done in one of two ways.
One way is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw, and this is its picture:
Then use another saw after this one, a little wider, and this is its picture:
Then also use another saw, wider than the second.  You should have a set of various saws, some wider than others and some shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp. Let them be made of Indian iron or good steel.
Use gentle strokes on the saw so as not to shake the head and cause harm.  If the bone is strong and hard, it should be perforated around it with drills, which they call non-penetrating drills, before using the saws.  They are called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not go beyond the skull bone to what is behind it, since the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, similar to a collar or small circle, which prevents it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp tip, in length and shortness, corresponds to the thickness of that skull. This is a picture of three types.
of drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then move the drill to another place, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of the probe or similar.
Then you cut with the cutters between every two holes and do that with the utmost gentleness you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone either with your hand or with some other of the instruments that have been prepared for that.
Such as forceps and delicate hooks.  You should be very careful that the drill or the cutter does not touch any of the meninges. When you have hollowed out the bone and cleared it from the meninges, if it was adhering to it, and removed it, you should scrape.
And smooth the roughness of what remains on the bone with another instrument resembling the cutter, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If any small bones and fragments remain, you take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound after that with bandages and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other way of operating, it is certainly an easy way, far from danger, Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said.
You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and most obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under it the edge of this lenticular cutter, and this is its form:.
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part of it should be on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the meninges and the sharp face of the cutter is on the bone, then you strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, no fearful accident will occur at all, even if the practitioner is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is sleepy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places on the bone, scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular cutter itself and remove it gently, for it will be removed without harm or fear.
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane and what has broken from the bone is its surface and there remains in it roughness and fine splinters, then you should smooth out that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps which you have made in several different sizes so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate one for each location depending on what the work leads you to.
and the fractured bone itself and its shape, and you should use for your smoothing, first, the widest of those rasps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do so in succession until you come to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and fine fractures, it is necessary to apply a treatment to each one according to what leads to its healing, and it is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest training in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth.
And dip it in wine and rose oil and place it on the first cloth and do this as gently as you can so that you do not weigh down the peritoneum then use a wide bandage over it and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound only.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from hot swelling, then loosen it and use after that the medications that have an excess of dryness, such as orris root, and thistle flour, and frankincense powder, and zedoary, and the like, which is that you make a powder from these medications.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry, and in general, use in that a medication that cleanses and does not sting, and take great care while treating the wound that it be clean, free from the harm of oil and dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and this causes a great affliction to the patient, and it may happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed from it, especially if its treatment is neglected.
Blackness on its surface, consider. If the symptoms that we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed. However, if the blackness only occurred from a medication placed on it, and the strength of that medication was such that it caused that blackness.
Then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear a cloth with them, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the types of treatment that are necessary until it heals.
